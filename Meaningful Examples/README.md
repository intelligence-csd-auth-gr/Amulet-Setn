## Explanation

This folder contains examples of misclassification from both methods tested in this research. Each file contains either the words or sentence(s) depending on the method
that influenced each algorithm's decision along with the computed similarity. Here we explain the naming used on the .txt files provided:
 
- 110: Ground Truth: 1, Proposed Method: 1, LWS: 0
- 101: Ground Truth: 1, Proposed Method: 0, LWS: 1
- 001: Ground Truth: 0, Proposed Method: 0, LWS: 1
- 010: Ground Truth: 0, Proposed Method: 1, LWS: 0


For example, a file that has 110 in its name contains an example where the ground truth for that example was 1 while the predictions
of the two methods where 1 for our Proposed Method and 0 for the LWS method, respectively. This means that the proposed method managed to correctly
classify this instance while LWS did not.
