This folder contains examples of misclassification from both methods tested in this research. Here we explain the naming used
on the .txt files provided.

110: Ground Truth: 1, Proposed Method: 1, LWS: 0
101: Ground Truth: 1, Proposed Method: 0, LWS: 1
001: Ground Truth: 0, Proposed Method: 0, LWS: 1
010: Ground Truth: 0, Proposed Method: 1, LWS: 0


For example a file that has 110 in its name contains an example where the ground truth for that example was 1 while the predictions
of the two methods where 1 for our Proposed Method and 0 for the LWS method, meaning that the proposed method managed to correctly
classify this instance while LWS did not.
