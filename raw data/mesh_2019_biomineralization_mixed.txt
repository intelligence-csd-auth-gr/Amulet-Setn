b'Panulirus argus virus 1 (PaV1) affects wild populations of Caribbean spiny lobsters. PaV1 can be lethal but shows predilection for juvenile lobsters. Because P. argus is one of the most valuable fisheries around the wider Caribbean region, monitoring disease prevalence in local populations is desirable. Diseased lobsters are easily recognized by their milky hemolymph, but this sign only becomes evident in advanced stages of infection. Other methods have been developed to detect PaV1, but are less practical for long-term monitoring of patterns of infection in populations. A previous study estimated the validity measures (sensitivity and specificity) of detection of PaV1 infection by observed clinical signs against endpoint PCR assays, using a representative sample of lobsters comprising mainly subadults and adults from a commercial fishing area. In the present study, these validity measures were estimated in a similar manner for a different population comprising mainly juveniles from a protected nursery area. We obtained virtually the same sensitivity and specificity values (0.48 and 1, respectively) for observed clinical signs as in the previous study (0.51 and 1, respectively), confirming the validity of applying a simple 2? correction factor to monitor the patterns of PaV1 infection over time based on more easily conducted visual assessments of a representative sample of the population. labels: #Animals#Fisheries#Hemolymph#Palinuridae#Polymerase Chain Reaction'
b"Objective: To explore the development trajectories of quality of life and acceptance of disability of burn patients in the rehabilitation treatment stage and the influencing factors. Methods: Totally 207 burn patients, including 157 males and 50 females, aged (40\\xc2\\xb113) years, who were in the rehabilitation treatment stage were selected by convenient sampling method from October 2016 to July 2017 in the Department of Burns of Fujian Medical University Union Hospital for this longitudinal study. At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the patient's quality of life and acceptance of disability were scored using the Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief and Chinese Version of Acceptance of Disability Scale-Revised respectively. Taking the intercept, the slope, and the curve slope as latent variables, the latent second growth curve model was constructed for the quality of life and the acceptance of disability. The robust maximum likelihood estimation (MLR) method was used to estimate the mean, the variance, and the covariance, so as to analyze the discharge level, the growth rate, the acceleration, and the correlation among them. Taking the acceptance of disability, the gender, the cause of burn, the severity of burn, the existence of complications, the payment way, and the education level as covariates, the latent second growth curve model was constructed for the quality of life. The MLR method was used to estimate the influence of covariates on the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of the quality of life. Results: At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the quality of life scores of patients were (102\\xc2\\xb136), (111\\xc2\\xb136), (118\\xc2\\xb137), and (122\\xc2\\xb137) points respectively, and the acceptance of disability scores were (73\\xc2\\xb117), (75\\xc2\\xb117), (77\\xc2\\xb117), and (78\\xc2\\xb118) points respectively. The estimated mean intercept of the quality of life and the acceptance of disability were 101.680 and 72.993 respectively at discharge, both of which showed a curve increasing trend in 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge (estimated mean slope=11.024, 3.086, t=15.376, 7.476, P<0.01), and the increasing rate (acceleration) gradually slowed down (estimated mean curve slope=-1.393, -0.426, t=-13.339, -4.776, P<0.01). There were significant individual differences in the discharge level and the acceleration of quality of life of patients (estimated intercept variance=1 174.527, t=9.332; estimated curve slope variance=2.379, t=6.402; P<0.01). There were significant individual differences in the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of patients' acceptance of disability (estimated intercept variance=267.017, t=9.262; estimated slope variance=32.264, t=2.356; estimated curve slope variance=0.882, t=2.939; P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was no significant correlation among the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of the quality of life and those of the acceptance of disability of patients (estimated intercept and slope=37.273, -1.457, t=0.859, -0.131; estimated intercept and curve slope=-6.712, -0.573, t=-1.089, -0.248; estimated slope and curve slope=-5.494, -5.988, t=-0.930, -2.512; P>0.05). Among the time-constant covariates, only the severity of burn and the presence of complications had a significant impact on the quality of life of patients at discharge (estimated intercept=-10.721, 5.522, t=-6.229, 1.977, P<0.05 or P<0.01). At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the level of acceptance of disability had a positive impact on the quality of life of patients (standardized regression coefficient=0.616, 0.669, 0.681, 0.678, t=18.874, 21.660, 22.824, 22.123, P<0.01). Conclusions: The initial levels of quality of life and acceptance of disability of burn patients in the rehabilitation treatment stage are relatively low, both with a curve increasing trend over time, and the increasing rate gradually slows down. Patients with complications and serious burns have poor quality of life at discharge, while the acceptance of disability has a positive impact on the quality of life. labels: #Adaptation, Psychological#Adult#Burns#Disabled Persons#Female#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Middle Aged#Quality of Life"
b'OBJECTIVE: To analyze of the minimum graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) required for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) without middle hepatic vein branch (MHVT) reconstruction.METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical data and outcomes of 303 LDLT patients over 16 years from 2001 to 2017. The minimum GRWR of non-middle hepatic vein reconstruction was analyzed by propensity score (PSM).RESULTS: With PSM analysis, no significant differences were observed in postoperative complications, SFSS, inpatient time, liver function, and coagulation function, but significant differences in 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival between MHVT reconstruction and non-reconstruction group. The patients with MHVT reconstruction had better short-term and long-term survival than those without reconstruction.CONCLUSION: For LDLT patients without HMVT reconstruction, GRWR should be greater than 0.86%; for patients with HMVT reconstruction, GRWR is acceptable between 0.5% and 0.6%. labels: #Graft Survival#Hepatic Veins#Humans#Liver#Liver Transplantation#Living Donors#Organ Size#Propensity Score#Retrospective Studies#Survival Rate'
b'BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of nosocomial infections. This species is characterised by the presence of pandemic lineages (International Clones) that present a broad antimicrobial resistance profile.OBJECTIVE: To perform the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from a clinical setting in the Amazon Basin, and to characterise their antimicrobial resistance determinants.METHODS: The genetic relationship of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Class A, B and D \\xc3\\xa2-lactamase genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile was obtained by Disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination.FINDINGS: All carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains belonged to three international clones, IC-1, IC-5 and IC-6, the latter recently reported by the first time in Brazil. The major determinant of carbapenem resistance in IC-1 and IC-5 strains was bla OXA-23, associated with ISAba1 and ISAba3, respectively, while IC-6 harboured the bla OXA-72.CONCLUSIONS: The A. baumannii epidemiology in Brazilian Amazon Region was unknown. It was demonstrated that A. baumannii XDR international clones were responsible for nosocomial infections in Boa Vista during 2016-2018, revealing that the epidemiological scenario of A. baumannii infections in Amazon Region resembles those from the cosmopolitan regions worldwide. labels: #Acinetobacter Infections#Acinetobacter baumannii#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Brazil#Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field#Genotype#Humans#Multilocus Sequence Typing#Phenotype#beta-Lactamases'
b'Introduction: The attitude to immunization and the issue of vaccine hesitancy in health care workers (HCWs) have been studied in a former survey performed by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). Aim: Our aim was to study the immunization attitude of primary care paediatricians, general practitioners and primary care nurses in Hungary. Method: We studied vaccine hesitancy in HCWs by way of a questionnaire, developed on the basis of a recent similar survey by ECDC in four countries. The online survey has been performed between May and July 2017. Altogether 765 questionnaires have been returned: 189 primary care paediatricians, 375 general practitioners working in adult or mixed practices, and 201 primary care nurses. The sample has been weighted to the country-specific features - e.g., location of the practice, residence and age of the HCWs - within each of the three groups, so from this aspect it can be considered representative. Results: Our results did not differ substantially from the international ECDC data. Approximately 2/3 of the primary care doctors and about 50% of the primary care nurses were convinced of the benefit and value of vaccines. Data on vaccine hesitancy were consolingly low, though the data on recommended vaccines were somewhat higher compared to the age related/NIP (National Immunization Plan) vaccines. The well-known vaccine scares - e.g., autism-MMR, etc., known also from the literature - could hardly been detected, and it can be explained by the voluntary participation in the study. The least supported vaccine is BCG, while the highest hesitancy rates are related to MMR in Hungary. Conclusion: The need to improve immunization-related communication among primary HCWs could clearly been detected - both in gradual and in post-gradual training programs.

b'OBJECTIVE: To explore whether manual acupuncture stimulation of "Shenshu " (BL23), "Guanyuan" (CV4), "Zhongwan" (CV12) can improve the ovarian function by resisting oxidant stress and reducing apoptosis of granulosa cells in rats with ovarian hypofunction.METHODS: Forty female SD rats with normal estrous cycles were randomly divided into blank control, model, hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (n=10 rats in each group). The ovarian hypofunction model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides suspension (50 mg\\xc2\\xb7kg-1\\xc2\\xb7d-1) for 14 successive days. Rats of the hormone therapy group were treated by gavage of estrogen and progesterone, and those of the acupuncture group treated by manual acupuncture stimulation of bilateral BL23 or CV4 and CV12 alternatively by using uniform reinforcing-reducing method for 10 s every 5 min (3 times in 10 min). The treatment was performed once daily for 14 days. The blank group was given equal volume of normal saline daily. On the 9th day, the estrous cycle of each rat was observed by means of vaginal smear test. The ovarian index, serum estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were detected by ELISA. Histopathological changes of the ovary tissue were observed by H.E. staining. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 and their mRNAs of the ovaries were determined by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real time-PCR separately.RESULTS: The menstrual disorder rate was 100% in the model group, and was significantly higher than those in the hormone therapy (30%) and acupuncture (40%) groups (P<0.01). Following modeling, the ovarian wet weight and index, E2 and SOD contents, Bcl-2 protein and mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and serum FSH, LH and MDA levels, Bax protein and mRNA expressions were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01) in the model group in comparison with the blank control group. H.E. staining showed a large amount of connective tissue in the ovary, with fewer mature follicles, increase of atresia follicles, significant reduction of luteal tissue, and appearance of scarring tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, there were more mature follicles, fewer atresia follicles, lower abnormal granulosa cell morphology and lower estrous cycle disorder ratio in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups. After the interventions, the decreased ovarian wet weight and index, serum E2 and SOD contents, expressions of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the increased levels of FSH and LH, MDA, expressions of Bax protein and mRNA were significantly decreased in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The effect of acupuncture was significantly superior to that of hormone in up-regulating SOD, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expressions (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve the menstrual disorder in rats with ovarian hypofunction, which is closely related to its effects in improving antioxidant stress ability and regulating the expressions of apoptosis-related protein and mRNA of ovarian gra-nulosa cells. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#Apoptosis#Female#Glycosides#Oxidative Stress#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Tripterygium'
b'OBJECTIVE: To establish a way for screening Mycobacterium mutants through adding the screening markers into pJV53.METHODS: The sucrose counter selection gene SacB and mutant hygromycin-resistant gene hygS were inserted into pJV53; The recovery of the hygromycin-resistance indicated the successful homologous recombination in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms), which could serve as mutant screening marker; The sucrose counter selection could be used to screen the plasmid-free mutants.RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid pJV53-SacB-hygS were successfully constructed. The rifampin-resistant rpoB D516Y and rpoB H526Q mutants and MSMEG_4487 G188A mutant were efficiently screened out. All mutants had shed the plasmid successfully.CONCLUSION: pJV53-SacB-hygS can efficiently contribute to construct and screen the mutants and to get the mutants shedding the plasmid self, which has high value of extensive application; the D516Y and H526Q mutations in gene rpoB of Mycobacterium tuberculosis contribute to its rifampin-resistance. labels: #Bacterial Proteins#DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Homologous Recombination#Microbial Sensitivity Tests#Mutation#Mycobacterium smegmatis#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Plasmids#Rifampin'
b'The unicellular model alga Micrasterias denticulata inhabits acid peat bogs that are highly endangered by pollutants due to their high humidity. As it was known from earlier studies that algae like Micrasterias are capable of storing barium naturally in form of BaSO4 crystals, it was interesting to experimentally investigate distribution and sequestration of barium and the chemically similar alkaline earth metal strontium. Additionally, we intended to analyze whether biomineralization by crystal formation contributes to diminution of the generally toxic effects of these minerals to physiology and structure of this alga which is closely related to higher plants. The results show that depending on the treatment differently shaped crystals are formed in BaCl2 and Cl2Sr exposed Micrasterias cells. Modern microscopic techniques such as analytical TEM by electron energy loss spectroscopy and Raman microscopy provide evidence for the chemical composition of these crystals. It is shown that barium treatment results in the formation of insoluble BaSO4 crystals that develop within distinct compartments. During strontium exposure long rod-like crystals are formed and are surrounded by membranes. Based on the Raman signature of these crystals their composition is attributed to strontium citrate. These crystals are instable and are dissolved during cell death. During strontium as well as barium treatment cell division rates and photosynthetic oxygen production decreased in dependence of the concentration, whereas cell vitality was reduced only slightly. Together with the fact that TEM analyses revealed only minor ultrastructural alterations as consequence of relatively high concentrated BaCl2 and Cl2Sr exposure, this indicates that biomineralization of Sr and Ba protects the cells from severe damage or cell death at least within a particular concentration range and time period. In the case of Sr treatment where ROS levels were found to be elevated, hallmarks for autophagy of single organelles were observed by TEM, indicating beginning degradation processes. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To study common problems in BRAF gene mutation detection, and conditions for repetition testing using thyroid fine needle aspiration specimens. Methods: A total of 8 644 cases of thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens at China-Japan Friendship Hospital were collected between February, 2012 and July, 2018. BRAF gene mutation was detected by real-time PCR. Repeat testing was performed in 237 cases when the results were inconsistent with clinical or cytological diagnosis or when uncertain results were obtained. Results: The final positive rates of BRAF mutation was 22.0% (1 897/8 625). Nineteen cases were excluded due to inadequate DNA samples. The average Ct value of internal quality control was 16.061, and the average Ct value of the positive samples was 19.147. Among 237 repeat tests, 51.4% (19/37) continued to have poor DNA quality and 48.6% (18/37) had adequate DNA resulting in 1 positive case and 17 negative cases. In 40 repetition of initial negative cases, results were unchanged. In initial positive cases, 40.4% (40/99) with a difference of Ct value (between BRAF gene and internal quality control) between 8 to 12 turned negative after repetition, 69.8% (37/53) of these cases with a difference of more than 12 turned negative after repetition. The sensitivity and specificity of BRAF mutation were 83.97% and 96.94%, respectively. Conclusions: Difference between BRAF gene Ct value and internal quality control Ct value is recommended as a reliability index for the test result. Cases with a difference greater than 8 should be subjected to repeat testing. labels: #Biopsy, Fine-Needle#China#DNA Mutational Analysis#Humans#Mutation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Reproducibility of Results#Thyroid Nodule'
b'Biomineralization is an interesting naturally occurring process of forming minerals by microorganisms, which offers an efficient way to sequester heavy metal ions within relatively stable solid phases. In this study, Bacillus cereus Cd01 was selected to investigate effects of self-mediated pH on biosorption and biomineralization of Cd2+ in whole 72h cultivation period. Results revealed that strain Cd01-mediated pH decrease of the cultivation medium from 7.0 to 6.1 inhibited biosorption of Cd2+ on Cd01 cells at the initial cultivation period, while an increased pH from 6.1 to 7.4 facilitated biosorption of Cd2+ on Cd01 cells at the middle and late cultivation period. The reasons were mainly that self-mediated pH altered cell surface hydrophobicity and cell membrane fluidity of strain Cd01. Moreover, biosorption and bioaccumulation of Cd2+ on Cd01 cells in the period of increased pH promoted biomineralization of Cd2+ observed by the transmission and scanning electron microscopes. The analyses of energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and select area electron diffraction demonstrated that Cd2+ loaded on Cd01 cells was biomineralized into polycrystalline and/ or amorphous cadmium sulfide and cadmium phosphate. These results suggest that strain Cd01 may play a potential role in biomineralization remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of immediate versus conventional delayed loading of four dental implants in edentulous mandibles with fixed prostheses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A blinded, two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial was conducted. A total of 42 patients were included, and each received four Br?nemark System implants with a TiUnite surface. The patients were randomly assigned to two study arms: 1) immediate-loading arm (IL), in which the mandibular denture was converted into an interim implant-supported fixed prosthesis (ISFP) on the day of surgery, with a permanent ISFP being inserted at least 3 months postsurgery; 2) conventional-loading arm (CL), in which the mandibular removable prosthesis was relieved at the implant site and relined with a soft tissue conditioner. Only implants with a minimum insertion torque of ? 35 Ncm were included in the IL group. Implants were loaded 4 to 6 months postsurgery. Independent, blind investigators assessed the patients at 2, 6 and 12 months and at 10 years. The outcome measures were prosthesis and implant success rates, type and frequency of complications and changes in peri-implant marginal bone levels.RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were allocated to the IL group and 22 to the CL group. However, one patient from the IL arm was excluded and three patients were reallocated to the CL arm. Two implants in one patient and one in another patient could not be placed with a ? 35 Ncm insertion torque, and a third patient developed severe sudden gag reflex and thus it was not possible to load the implants immediately. At a later stage, one of the patients who failed the initial stability test dropped out of the study. Therefore, initially, 24 patients were conventionally loaded and 16 patients were immediately loaded. At the 10-year follow-up, six patients dropped out from the IL arm and two from the CL arm. Also, at the 10-year-follow-up, the CL and IL study arms consisted of 22 and 10 participants, respectively, using the per-protocol (PP) analysis. Six implants failed in two patients of the CL arm (two implants in one patient and four implants in another patient), and three implants failed in three patients in the IL arm (PP analysis), respectively. The patient-level implant failure rate was 10% (intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis) and 14% (PP analysis) in the CL arm, and 25% (ITT) and 20% (PP) in the IL arm. The difference was not statistically significant (95% CI from -0.18 to 0.39, P = 0.65). The failure rate at the implant level was 8% (ITT) and 8% (PP) in the CL arm, and 6% (ITT) and 5% (PP) in the IL arm. The difference was not statistically significant (95% CI from -0.06 to 0.14, P = 0.44). Ten years after loading, patients in the IL arm lost an average of 0.55 \\xc2\\xb1 0.64 mm of peri-implant bone versus 0.41 \\xc2\\xb1 0.40 mm of peri-implant bone loss observed in the CL arm. The 10-year bone loss in both arms was statistically significant compared with the baseline (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two arms for peri-implant bone level changes (the difference between the arms was 0.14 mm \\xc2\\xb1 0.50 mm; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.52; P = 0.43). One prosthesis failed due to the loss of all four implants in one patient of the CL arm. Eight patients from the IL arm were affected by 13 complications (such as pain from fractures and inflammation) versus seven patients (10 complications) from the CL arm. The complication rate was 67% in the IL arm and 35% in the CL arm. The difference in complication proportions between the two arms was not statistically significant (difference in proportions = 0.32; 95% CI = -0.08 to 0.61; P = 0.14). All complications were managed successfully.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term data of immediate loading of four dental implants with a mandibular fixed prosthesis revealed comparable clinical outcomes to conventional loading. Therefore, immediate loading should be considered in the treatment of edentulous patients. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Humans#Immediate Dental Implant Loading#Mandible'
b'In recent years, biomineralization process is being employed in development of bioconcrete, which is emerging as a sustainable method to enhance the durability of concrete by way of increasing compressive strength and reducing the chloride permeability. In this study, different bacterial strains isolated from the soils of the Laguna Region of Mexico were selected for further study. ACRN5 strain demonstrated higher urease activity than other strains, and the optimum substrate concentration, pH, and temperature were 120\\xc2\\xa0mM, pH\\xc2\\xa08, and 25\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb0C, respectively. Further, Km and Vmax of urease activity of ACRN5 were 21.38\\xc2\\xa0mM and 0.212\\xc2\\xa0mM\\xc2\\xa0min-1, respectively. It was observed that addition of ACRN5 at 105\\xc2\\xa0cells\\xc2\\xa0ml-1 to cement-water mixture significantly increased (14.94%) in compressive strength after 36\\xc2\\xa0days of curing and reduced chloride penetration. Deposition of calcite in bio-mortars was observed in scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction spectrometry analyses. Results of this study demonstrated the role of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation in improving the physico-mechanical properties of bio-mortars. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"Chronic critical illness (CCI) refers to a group of critically ill patients who survive the acute phase of intensive care, but with persistent organ dysfunction, thus entering a chronic period of continuous dependence on life support system, and still need to stay in intensive care unit (ICU) for a long time. Persistent inflammatory response-immunosuppression-catabolic syndrome (PICS) is the main pathophysiological feature of CCI. Three factors interact to form a vicious circle, leading to poor prognosis. Nutritional support therapy is a key link in the comprehensive treatment of CCI. Enteral nutrition (EN) should be started as soon as possible if conditions permit. If EN can not be implemented, temporary or transitional parenteral nutrition (PN) should be used, and EN should be added gradually in time. At the same time, the amount of PN should be gradually reduced. When EN meets more than 60% of patients' energy and protein requirements, PN can be considered to be discontinued. The main strategies and functions of CCI nutritional support therapy are as follows: strengthening high protein supply to correct negative nitrogen balance and inhibit catabolism, selecting branched chain amino acids (BCAA) to promote anabolism, using immunomodulators (arginine, \\xc3\\xb93 polyunsaturated fatty acids) to improve immune suppression and inflammatory response, supplementing micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) to counteract the decrease in intake and the increase in consumption, and adding probiotics to maintain the intestinal microecological balance, and so on. Reasonable nutritional support therapy not only improve malnutrition of CCI patients, but also help to reduce complications, thus speeding up rehabilitation, improving prognosis, shortening ICU hospitalization time, and even reducing mortality. labels: #Chronic Disease#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Nutritional Support"
b'The production of calcium carbonate by coccolithophores (haptophytes) contributes significantly to global biogeochemical cycling. The recent identification of a silicifying haptophyte, Prymnesium neolepis, has provided new insight into the evolution of biomineralisation in this lineage. However, the cellular mechanisms of biomineralisation in both calcifying and silicifying haptophytes remain poorly understood. To look for commonalities between these two biomineralisation systems in haptophytes, we have determined the role of actin and tubulin in the formation of intracellular biomineralised scales in the coccolithophore, Coccolithus braarudii and in P. neolepis. We find that disruption of the actin network interferes with secretion of the biomineralised elements in both C. braarudii and P. neolepis. In contrast, disruption of the microtubule network does not prevent secretion of the silica scales in P. neolepis but results in production of abnormally small silica scales and also results in the increased formation of malformed coccoliths in C. braarudii. We conclude that the cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in biomineralisation in both silicifying and calcifying haptophytes. There are some important similarities in the contribution of the cytoskeleton to these different forms of biomineralisation, suggesting that common cellular mechanisms may have been recruited to perform similar roles in both lineages. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Commercial shellfish aquaculture is vulnerable to the impacts of ocean acidification driven by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2 ) absorption by the ocean as well as to coastal acidification driven by land run off and rising sea level. These drivers of environmental acidification have deleterious effects on biomineralization. We investigated shell biomineralization of selectively bred and wild-type families of the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata in a study of oysters being farmed in estuaries at aquaculture leases differing in environmental acidification. The contrasting estuarine pH regimes enabled us to determine the mechanisms of shell growth and the vulnerability of this species to contemporary environmental acidification. Determination of the source of carbon, the mechanism of carbon uptake and use of carbon in biomineral formation are key to understanding the vulnerability of shellfish aquaculture to contemporary and future environmental acidification. We, therefore, characterized the crystallography and carbon uptake in the shells of S.\\xc2\\xa0glomerata, resident in habitats subjected to coastal acidification, using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction and carbon isotope analyses (as \\xc3\\xa413 C). We show that oyster families selectively bred for fast growth and families selected for disease resistance can alter their mechanisms of calcite crystal biomineralization, promoting resilience to acidification. The responses of S.\\xc2\\xa0glomerata to acidification in their estuarine habitat provide key insights into mechanisms of mollusc shell growth under future climate change conditions. Importantly, we show that selective breeding in oysters is likely to be an important global mitigation strategy for sustainable shellfish aquaculture to withstand future climate-driven change to habitat acidification. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for detecting nicotine and cotinine in hair by hydrophilic interaction chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.METHODS: Hair samples were hydrolyzed in sodium hydroxide solution before extraction with dichloromethane. The samples were blown to dry with nitrogen and dissolved with mobile phase. The filtrate of the samples was injected into a chromatographic-mass spectrometry system for analysis. The separation was performed by a hydrophilic column, with which methanol-0.1% ammonia was used as the mobile phase. The quantitative detection of Nicotine and Cortinine was carried out with electron spray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The established method was used for detecting nicotine and cotinine in 602 hair samples of pregnant women and 31 hair and urine samples of volunteers.RESULTS: A standard curve was drawn for the established method of hydrophilic liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Good linearity was obtained for detecting nicotine and cotinine in the range of 0.030-100.000 \\xc3\\xacg/L, with a detection limit (MDL) of 0.007 6 \\xc3\\xacg/g and 0.004 4 \\xc3\\xacg/g, respectively. The inter-day and intra-day precisions reached a level of less than 10%. The recoveries of the spiked samples ranged from 81.0% to 102.0%. About 0.020-0.260 \\xc3\\xacg/g nicotine and 0.004 8-0.069 0 \\xc3\\xacg/g cotinine were detected in the pregnant women without exposure to secondhand smoking (SHS), compared with 0.029-0.350 \\xc3\\xacg/g nicotine and 0.005 6-0.085 0 \\xc3\\xacg/g cotinine in those exposed to SHS. Nicotine and cotinine were also found in the hair and urine samples of volunteers, which were correlated with smoking (P < 0.05). A dose-response relationship were found between smoking and hair nicotine.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is accurate and sensitive for detecting nicotine and cotinine in hair samples. Hair nicotine can be a specific biomarker for assessing exposure to tobacco smoking. labels: #Biomarkers#Chromatography, Liquid#Cotinine#Female#Hair#Humans#Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions#Nicotine#Pregnancy#Tandem Mass Spectrometry#Tobacco Smoke Pollution'
b"Species invasions are a major driver of ecological change, are very difficult to control or reverse, and will increase with climate change and global trade. Invasion sciences consider how species in invaded environments adapt, but neither scientists nor policy makers consider human adaptation to invasive species and how this affects ecosystems and well-being. To address this, a framework conceptualising autochthonous human adaptation to invasions was developed based on the Human Adaptation to Biodiversity Change framework and a case study metasynthesis. Results show that adaptation occurs within different spheres of human activity and organisation at different social-ecological scales; responses have feedbacks within and across these spheres. Adaptation to invasives and other drivers is a set of highly contextual, complex, non-linear responses that make up pathways pursued over time. Most invasive species management and adaptation occurs 'from below,' and policies and planned control efforts should support autochthonous adaptation, rather than undermining it. labels: #Biodiversity#Climate Change#Ecology#Ecosystem#Humans#Introduced Species"
b'STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.BACKGROUND: Inferior facetectomies, with the utilization of segmental pedicle screw constructs for corrective fixation, can provide adequate flexibility and post less risk of neural tissue and blood loss. We analyzed outcomes of surgical treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) using inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs. We hypothesized that adequate main curve correction and suitable surgical outcomes would be observed using this technique.METHODS: We reviewed 38 AIS patients who underwent inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs by 2 surgeons at a single institution between May 2014 and December 2016. Coronal and sagittal radiographic measurements were evaluated over 1-year follow-up by 2 trained observers not associated with the surgeries. Surgical details, complications, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were also recorded.RESULTS: Mean fusion levels were 11.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.7. The mean Cobb angle of main AIS curves improved from 48.6\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a10.1 degree preoperatively to 11.8\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a6.2 degree postoperatively and 12.4\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a6.2 degree at 1-year follow-up, which percentage correction was 75.9% and 74.6%, respectively. The mean thoracic kyphosis (T5-12) angle was 20.7\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a11.6 degree preoperatively, 17.4\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a8.0 degree postoperatively, and 16.8\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a8.4 degree at 1-year follow-up. The mean surgical time, estimated blood loss, and LOS were 232.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a35.7\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes, 475.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a169.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, and 3.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.3 days. Twelve patients received blood transfusion. There were no neurological or wound complications.CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrated adequate correction of main AIS curves, acceptable thoracic kyphosis and blood loss, and short surgical time and LOS in AIS patients treated with inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs, potentially indicating that inferior facetectomies are adequate and suitable for AIS surgery when segmental pedicle screw constructs are utilized. labels: #Adolescent#Female#Humans#Male#Orthopedic Procedures#Pedicle Screws#Retrospective Studies#Scoliosis#Spine#Treatment Outcome'
b'During August 9-October 31, 2019, 96 patients were classified as having e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH); other patients are being investigated for case classification and exposures. Among 58 patients interviewed, 53 (91%) reported obtaining tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products from informal sources such as friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), the MDH Public Health Laboratory (PHL) analyzed 46 THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from 12 EVALI patients for various potential toxicants, including vitamin E acetate, which has recently been detected in some THC-containing products and in samples of lung fluid from EVALI patients (1-4). To explore whether vitamin E acetate is a recently added component in THC-containing products, MDH tested ten products seized by law enforcement in 2018, before the EVALI outbreak, and 20 products seized in 2019, during the outbreak. Twenty-four products obtained from 11 EVALI patients from 2019 contained vitamin E acetate. Among the seized products tested by MDH, none seized in 2018 contained vitamin E acetate, although all tested THC-containing products seized in 2019 tested positive for vitamin E acetate. These chemical analyses of products obtained from EVALI patients and of products intended for the illicit market both before and during the outbreak support a potential role for vitamin E acetate in the EVALI outbreak; however, the number of products tested was small, and further research is needed to establish a causal link between exposure to inhaled vitamin E acetate and EVALI. Collaboration between public health jurisdictions and law enforcement to characterize THC-containing products circulating before the recognition of the EVALI outbreak and during the outbreak might provide valuable information about a dynamic market. These Minnesota findings highlight concerns about e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC acquired from informal sources. Because local supply chains and policy environments vary, CDC continues to recommend not using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC or any e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from informal sources. E-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or pregnant women.* Until the relationship between inhaled vitamin E acetate and lung health is better characterized, vitamin E acetate should not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping, products. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Dronabinol#Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems#Female#Humans#Law Enforcement#Legislation, Drug#Lung Injury#Male#Middle Aged#Minnesota#Vaping#Vitamin E#Young Adult'
b'OBJECTIVE: To understand the relationship between obesity and depression in the elderly in China, and to explore whether there are differences between the genders.METHODS: The data were collected from the 2015 China Health and Retirement National Investigation (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, CHARLS). The respondents were grouped according to depressive status. The difference of depressive status between the elderly male and female groups was examined by Chi-square test. The relationship between depression, obesity and the other sociological factors was analyzed by binary logistic regression.RESULTS: There were 4 019 valid cases, including 2 109 males (52.48%) and 1 910 females (47.52%). All the respondents were aged 60 years and over. There were 474 cases of central obesity (11.79%) and 2 418 cases of abdominal obesity (60.16%). There were significant differences in central obesity and abdominal obesity between the elderly male and female groups (P < 0.001). 1 304 cases suffered from depression, accounting for 32.45%, of which 539 cases were male (41.33%) and 765 cases were female (58.67%). Different groups of gender, central obesity and abdominal obesity had significant differences in depressive status (P < 0.001). The results of univariate analysis indicated that the characteristics of female, divorced/widowed/unmarried, in rural areas, having chronic diseases and functional loss were the risk factors for depression. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that, in terms of the total sample, after adjustment for the confounding factors, both central obesity and abdominal obesity groups were less likely to suffer from depression. After stratified by gender, both central obesity and abdominal obesity were negatively correlated with depression.CONCLUSIONS: The elderly with central obesity or abdominal obesity are less likely to suffer from depression, regardless of gender. labels: #Aged#China#Depression#Female#Humans#Logistic Models#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Middle Aged#Obesity, Abdominal'
b"New mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) formulations are constantly introduced in the market, usually in a powder-and-liquid form. Bioceramic (Bio-C) Repair is a ready-for-use material suggested as substitute for MTA, but its properties need to be studied. This study evaluated the cytotoxicity, biocompatibility and biomineralization of Bio-C Repair compared to MTA Repair High-Plasticity (MTA-HP) and white MTA-Angelus (MTA-Ang). L929 fibroblasts were exposed to material-extracted (undiluted, \\xc2\\xbd and ? dilutions; 6, 24 and 48h). Polyethylene tubes with material or empty (control) were implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of rats. After 7 and 30 days (n=8), the specimens were removed for analysis (hematoxylin-eosin, von Kossa and polarized light). Cytotoxicity data were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA, and biocompatibility data by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (p<0.05). The cells exposed to the materials had greater viability at most of the periods compared with control (p<0.05). The undiluted and \\xc2\\xbd dilutions of MTA-HP extract showed higher cytocompatibility than Bio-C Repair at 6 h and with the ? dilution at 24 h (p<0.05); the white MTA-Ang showed higher cytocompatibility than Bio-C Repair at most of periods (p<0.05). The undiluted white MTA-Ang extract had higher cytocompatibility at 6 and 24h than MTA-HP, and with \\xc2\\xbd dilution at 24h (p<0.05). The materials' cytocompatibility was similar at 48h for most dilutions (p>0.05). At 7 and 30 days, the groups had moderate and mild inflammation, respectively (p>0.05). All materials showed positive structures for von Kossa and polarized light. In conclusion, Bio-C Repair had similar cytocompatibility to MTA-based materials is biocompatible and induces biomineralization. labels: #Biomineralization"
b'Objective: To investigate the detection rate of pulmonary nodules and the accuracy of automated measurement in chest simulation phantom by artificial intelligent computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules with different pre-adaptive iterative techniques (ASIR-V) in wide-spectrum CT scanning. Methods: Sixteen pulmonary nodules with different diameters, densities and shapes were placed in the chest simulation phantom from December 2017 to March 2018. The weight of ASIR-V was set at 0%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% respectively by using Revolution CT broadband energy spectrum scanning protocol. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the dose volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) of each group. Scanning data were imported into Tuma Shenwei artificial pulmonary nodule analysis software to evaluate the nature of the detected nodules, and ICC was used to detect the differences among groups. Results: With the increase of ASIR-V weight, the effective dose of patients decreased gradually. CTDIvol of five groups of radiation dose volume CT dose index was 7.93, 7.24, 5.85, 5.15, 3.76 mGy,dose-length product DLP was 379, 346, 280, 246, 179 mGy\\xc2\\xb7cm.There was a linear negative correlation between ASIR-V weights and CTDIvol as well as DLP, r value was-0.969, P<0.01.There was no significant difference in the detection rate of pulmonary nodules between AI and physicians (P>0.05). There was high intraclass correlation coefficients for the diameter, volume, CT value and malignant percentage of pulmonary nodules (ICCs:0.981-1.000). Conclusions: Radiation dose of unenhanced chest CT scan using wide detector spectral imaging decreased with the increasing of preset ASIR-V. Lung nodule detection rate and evaluation performance can be maintained well by using ASIR-V reconstructions at lower radiation dosage. labels: #Algorithms#Artificial Intelligence#Humans#Lung#Phantoms, Imaging#Radiation Dosage#Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin in the skin lesions of patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc) and its effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human epidermal keratinocytes.METHODS: The expression of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin, Snail1 and E-cadherin in the skin lesions sample of 45 SSc patients and normal skin sample from 20 healthy adults was detected with SP immunohistochemistry. HaCaT, the human epidermal keratinocytes, were treated with different concentrations of Wnt10b (0 ng/mL (control), 2 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) for 48 h. then detected the localization of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin in HaCaT cells by immunofluorescence assay, determined the mRNA levels of Snail1 and Snail2 in HaCaT cells by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, detected the proteins expression of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin, Vimentin, N-cadherin and E-cadherin in HaCaT cells by Western blot.RESULTS: The positive rates of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin, Snail1 and E-cadherin in skin lesions of SSc patients were 100%, 88.89% and 2.22% respectively, while in healthy adult skin, the corresponding positive rates were 0%, 10.00%, and 95.00%. The difference between the two groups was significant. Compared with control group, treatment with different concentrations of Wnt10b (2 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) induced up-regulation of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin expression and promoted translocation of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin from cytoplasm to nucleus, increased the mRNA levels of Snail1 and Snail2 (P < 0.05), and up-regulated the proteins expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, down-regulated the E-cadherin protein expression in HaCaT cells (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally activated Wnt/\\xc3\\xa2-catenin signaling pathway and abnormally expressed EMT-related proteins are observed in SSc lesions. Activation of Wnt/\\xc3\\xa2-catenin signaling pathway may promote EMT in HaCaT cells. labels: #Adult#Antigens, CD#Cadherins#Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition#Humans#Keratinocytes#Scleroderma, Systemic#Skin#Snail Family Transcription Factors#Vimentin#Wnt Signaling Pathway#beta Catenin'
b'Integration of biological macromolecules with inorganic materials via biomineralization has demonstrated great potential for development of nanotheranostic agents. To produce multifunctionality, integration of multiple components in the biomineralized theranostic agents is required; however, how to efficiently and reproducibly implement this is challenging. In this report, a universal biomineralization strategy is developed by incorporation of oxidization polymerization into albumin-templated biomineralization for facile synthesis of nanotheranostic agents. A series of biomineralized polymers and manganese dioxide hybrid nanoparticles (PMHNs) can be synthesized via the polymerization of various monomers, including dopamine (DA), epigallocatechin (EGC), pyrrole (PY), and diaminopyridine (DP), along with the reduction of KMnO4 and formation of manganese dioxide nanoparticles in albumin templates. These biomineralized PMHNs demonstrate ultrahigh MRI (longitudinal relaxivity up to 38 mM-1 s-1) and ultrasonic (US) imaging contrasting capabilities and have excellent photothermal therapy efficacy with complete ablation of orthotopic tumors. Moreover, these biomineralized hybrid nanoparticles can be effectively excreted through the kidneys, avoiding potential systemic toxicity. Thus, integration of polymerization into biomineralization presents a strategy for the fabrication of hybrid nanomaterials, allowing the production of multifunctional and biocompatible nanotheranostic agents via a facile one-pot method. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'In the present paper, we introduce a newly modified device named "transcutaneous electrical auricular concha stimulator (TEACS)" for rats. It concludes a main unit (power and control buttons) with newly designed specific output electrodes. Each of the output electrode is made up of two pieces of iron sheet containing magnet and can be firmly attached to the auricular concha and the corresponding site of dorsal auricle, respectively. The two iron sheets are separately connected to each of the output terminal of the main unit via two pieces of wire. This newly modified output electrode replaces the original wire clip, and solves the problems of easy loosening and easy injury of the original spring clip due to repeated usage, being simple, flexible and convenient in application. labels: #Animals#Electric Stimulation Therapy#Rats#Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between plasma adiponectin levels and risk of breast cancer by molecular subtype.METHODS: A case-control study including 437 histopathologic confirmed primary breast cancer cases and 469 healthy female controls was conducted between April 2014 and May 2015. Basic information of the participants were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected and the plasma adiponectin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELASA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences of plasma adiponectin levels among the control group and the breast cancer groups with different molecular subtypes. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the association between plasma adiponectin levels and risk of breast cancer by molecular subtypes. All the statistical analyses were stratified by menopausal status.RESULTS: Among the 437 breast cancer cases, there were 310 Luminal breast cancer cases, 83 HER-2-enriched breast cancer cases and 44 basal-like breast cancer cases. The median (P25, P75) of plasma adiponectin level of the controls was 14.85 (9.69, 21.35) \\xc3\\xacg/mL. The medians (P25, P75) of plasma adiponectin levels of the cases were 11.74 (8.15, 16.14) \\xc3\\xacg/mL, 12.02(8.43, 16.96) \\xc3\\xacg/mL and 12.67(8.25, 17.27) \\xc3\\xacg/mL for Luminal, HER-2-enriched and basal-like subtype respectively, which were statistically different from the controls (P < 0.001). Multinomial logistic regression showed that, after adjustment for the confounders, the higher levels of plasma adiponectin were associated with the lower risks of pre-menopausal Luminal breast cancer (ORpre-menopausal Luminal=0.50, 95%CI: 0.27-0.92, Ptrend=0.001), post-menopausal Luminal breast cancer (ORpost-menopausal Luminal=0.06, 95%CI: 0.02-0.23, Ptrend < 0.001) and post-menopausal HER-2-enriched breast cancer (ORpost-menopausal HER-2-enriched=0.06, 95%CI: 0.01-0.62, Ptrend=0.001).CONCLUSION: Lower levels of plasma adiponectin may increase the risk of pre-menopausal and post-menopausal Luminal breast cancer and post-menopausal HER-2-enriched breast cancer. labels: #Adiponectin#Breast Neoplasms#Case-Control Studies#Female#Humans#Risk Factors'
b'Bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushing and transbronchial biopsy are of fundamental importance in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting the lungs of immunosuppressed patients, especially those infected with HIV. This was a descriptive and retrospective study, in which the results of bronchoalveolar lavages, bronchial brushings and transbronchial biopsies of HIV-positive patients attended at the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro from 1999 to 2015 were reviewed to determine the most frequent findings in these patients, to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures and to correlate bronchoscopy results with clinical and radiological findings. Serological tests for HIV were confirmed and cases with negative or unverified serology were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for correlation with clinical and radiological findings. A total of 1,423 patients with a mean age of 50 years were initially selected; 727 cases had no serology for HIV; 696 had serology for HIV and 64 were positive. Of these, 47 were men, aged 24 to 84 years, and 17 women, aged 31 to 69 years. Biopsies and cytological tests were positive in 20 (31.25%) of the 64 patients and the most frequent diagnosis was pneumocystosis, found in 8 cases (12.5%). Of the 20 bronchofibroscopy-positive patients, only 2 did not show agreement between histopathological and clinical-radiological diagnoses. The analysis of the cytological tests and biopsy specimens obtained by bronchofibroscopy seems to be valuable for the etiological diagnosis of pulmonary infections in HIV- positive patients; however, negative results do not always exclude the diagnosis. In these cases, clinical symptoms and imaging findings may help to guide the best therapy. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Biopsy#Bronchoalveolar Lavage#Bronchoscopy#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Lung Diseases#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'A new mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) material has been developed with a modified composition that requires investigations to support its clinical use. This study evaluated the biocompatibility and biomineralization of this new MTA material and compared it with that of two other MTA cements over time. Tubes containing materials (or empty tubes as controls) were inserted into the subcutaneous tissues of 40 rats. On days 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90, the tubes were removed with the surrounding tissues, which were either stained with haematoxylin and eosin or von Kossa for further analyses or unstained for observation under polarized light. On days 7 and 15, moderate inflammation was observed in most specimens, and the fibrous capsule was thick. On day 30, there was mild inflammation in all groups, and the fibrous capsule was thin. On days 60 and 90, there was mild inflammation in the material groups, while the control group showed no inflammation, although no statistically significant difference between the groups was observed and the fibrous capsule was thin. All material groups showed structures that stained with von Kossa and could be observed under polarized light; this was not found for the control. In conclusion, the new MTA material had biocompatibility and biomineralization properties similar to those of the two existing MTA materials. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Nephrocalcinosis often begins on a calcium phosphate deposit, at the tip of the medullo-papillary complex (MPC) known as Randall\\\'s plaque (RP). Contextualizing proximally observed biominerals within the MPC has led us to postulate a mechanobiological switch that can trigger interstitial biomineralization at the MPC tip, remote from the intratubular biominerals. Micro X-ray computed tomography scans of human MPCs correlated with transmission and scanning electron micrographs, and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry demonstrated novel findings about anatomically-specific biominerals. An abundance of proximal intratubular biominerals were associated with emergence of distal interstitial RP. The fundamental architecture of the MPC and mineral densities at the proximal and distal locations of the MPC differed markedly. A predominance of plate-like minerals or radially oriented plate-like crystallites within spheroidal minerals in the proximal intratubular locations, and core-shell type crystallites within spheroidal minerals in distal interstitial locations were observed. Based on the MPC anatomic location of structure-specific biominerals, a biological switch within the mineral-free zone occurring between the proximal and distal locations is postulated. The "on" and "off" switch is dependent on changes in the pressure differential resulting from changes in tubule diameters; the "Venturi effect" changes the "circumferential strain" and culminates in interstitial crystal deposits in the distal tubule wall in response to proximal tubular obstruction. These distal interstitial mineralizations can emerge into the collecting system of the kidney linking nephrocalcinosis with nephrolithiasis. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Poly-(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) has been widely investigated as scaffold material for bone tissue engineering owing to its biosafety, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. However, the bioinert surface of PLGA may fail in regulating cellular behavior and directing osteointegration between the scaffold and the host tissue. In this article, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (oCS) and type I collagen (Col I) were assembled onto PLGA surface via layer by layer technique (LbL) as an adhesive coating for the attachment of inorganic minerals. The multilayer-modified PLGA scaffold was mineralized in vitro to ensure the deposition of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP). It was found that nHAP crystals were more uniformly and firmly attached on the multilayer-modified PLGA as compared with the pure PLGA scaffold, which remarkably improved PLGA surface and mechanical properties. Additionally, in vitro biocompatibility of PLGA scaffold, in terms of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) attachment, spreading and proliferation was greatly enhanced by nHAP coating and multilayer deposition. Furthermore, the fabricated composite scaffold also shows the ability to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through the up-regulation of osteogenic marker genes. Thus, this novel biomimetic composite scaffold might achieve a desirable therapeutic result for bone tissue regeneration. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

b'Objective: To investigate the therapeutic strategy in patients with early gastric cancer after noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Methods: A total of 107 cases with early gastric cancer receiving noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection were collected and the patients were classified into an additional gastrectomy group (n=41) and a simple follow-up group (n=66) according to the therapeutic method used after noncurative ESD. The clinicopathological information, short- and long-term clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The mean age of the patients in the gastrectomy group and follow-up group was(59.2\\xc2\\xb18.7)years old and(64.7\\xc2\\xb18.8)years old, respectively. The depth of submucosal invasion was (1445.83\\xc2\\xb1803.12) and (794.71\\xc2\\xb1815.79) \\xc3\\xacm, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.020 for age and P=0.010 for depth of submucosal invasion). Compared with follow-up group, the patients with undifferentiated histologic type, deep invasion of submucosa (SM2), diffuse type, lymphovascular invasion and neural invasion were more common in the gastrectomy group (P<0.05). The R0 resection rate of ESD in the gastrectomy group was significantly lower than the follow-up group(26.8% vs 65.2%, P<0.001). The positive residual tumor rate and LNM rate of additional gastrectomy group were 31.7%(13/41)and 9.76%(4/41)according to the pathological results after gastrectomy. The gastrectomy group had 2 cases of local recurrence (2/41, 4.9%), while 5(5/66, 7.6%)in the follow-up group(4.9% vs 7.6%, P=0.883). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the two study groups (P=0.066 and 0.938, respectively). Conclusions: Assessment of LNM risk should be performed in patients with noncurative endoscopic resection. For patients with low risk of LNM who are intolerance of additional gastrectomy due to old age and comorbidities, close follow-up with endoscopy can be considered as an alternative. labels: #Aged#Disease-Free Survival#Endoscopic Mucosal Resection#Gastrectomy#Humans#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Retrospective Studies#Stomach Neoplasms#Survival Rate#Treatment Outcome'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the application value of surface electromyography in children with dysphagia.METHODS: A total of 20 children with dysphagia were enrolled as the observation group, and 20 healthy children, matched for sex and age, were enrolled as the control group. Surface electromyography was used to record the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the resting state and the state after water swallowing. The two groups were compared in terms of the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the resting state and the state after swallowing 5\\xe2\\x80\\x85mL water. The observation group was observed in terms of the changes in the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups after 1 month of rehabilitation treatment. A Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation of the degree of dysphagia with the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the observation group.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the resting state (P>0.05), while after water swallowing, the observation group had significantly higher electromyography integral values than the control group (P<0.05). The observation group had significant improvements in the clinical symptoms of dysphagia after treatment, with significant reductions in the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups (P<0.05). The severity of dysphagia was positively correlated with the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Surface electromyography is useful in the diagnosis and therapeutic effect evaluation for dysphagia in children. labels: #Child#Deglutition#Deglutition Disorders#Electromyography#Humans'
b"Objective: To explore the effect of tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall in emergency treatment of laryngeal edema in patients with burns. Methods: From November 2000 to August 2018, 22 patients with severe burn or extremely severe burn combined with acute laryngeal edema were rescued in the author's unit, including 18 males and 4 females, aged 17 to 68 years. All patients were complicated with mild inhalation injury or above and more than deep partial-thickness burn to head, face, and neck. From November 2000 to October 2012, simple emergency tracheotomy was performed for 12 cases. From May 2013 to August 2018, tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall was performed for 10 cases. Rescue effect and complication of the two kinds of tracheotomy were recorded. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test. Results: Among the 12 patients treated with simple emergency tracheotomy, 5 cases survived and 7 cases died of suffocation during tracheotomy. Among the 10 patients treated with tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall, 9 cases survived and 1 case died of cardiac arrest caused by arrhythmia. There was statistically significant difference in successful rescue effect between the two kinds of tracheotomy (P<0.05). Among the 14 patients who were successfully rescued, symptoms of insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder occurred in 12 cases, which were relieved after symptomatic treatment for 14 to 45 d without permanent hypoxic brain damage. Conclusions: In case of loss of the condition of preventive tracheotomy, first aid of acute laryngeal edema of burn patient is very difficult. Tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall is simple and rapid with high successful rate and amelioration of hypoxia, which is an ideal plan for laryngeal edema. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Airway Obstruction#Burns#Emergency Treatment#Female#Humans#Laryngeal Edema#Male#Middle Aged#Punctures#Tracheotomy#Young Adult"
b'We evaluated overall survivals (OSs) of alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without LC compared to those with LC.Between 2005 and 2015, 1343 patients were initially diagnosed as having HCC in our hospital. Of these, 186 alcohol-related HCC patients were enrolled in this study, and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. Significant alcohol intake was defined as more than 210\\xe2\\x80\\x8agrams/week for men and more than 140\\xe2\\x80\\x8agrams/week for women.Non-cirrhotic HCC was observed in 37.1% of the 186 patients. Cumulative OS rates were significantly higher in non-cirrhotic patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006). For the 117 cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class B (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001) or CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001) patients, respectively. In the 69 non-cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class C patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), but, not than in the CTP class B patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.157). Multivariate analyses revealed that CTP class B (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), and tumor size (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006) were significant predictors for OS in cirrhotic patients, and that CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002) and tumor size (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.023) were significant predictors for OS in non-cirrhotic patients.OS was found to be better for non-cirrhotic than cirrhotic patients with alcohol-related HCC. Survivals of alcohol-related HCC patients without cirrhosis were comparable between patients with CTP class A and B. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Female#Humans#Liver Cirrhosis#Liver Diseases, Alcoholic#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors'
b'Acid proteins capable of nucleating Ca2+ and displaying aggregation capacity play key roles in the formation of calcium carbonate biominerals. The helix-loop helix EF-hands are the most common Ca2+-binding motifs in proteins. Calcium is bound by the loop region. These motifs are found in many proteins that are regulated by calcium. Gad m 1, an Atlantic cod \\xc3\\xa2-parvalbumin isoform, is a monomeric EF-hand protein that acts as a Ca2+ buffer in fish muscle; the neutral and acid apo-forms of this protein can form amyloids. Since Ca2+-nucleating proteins have a propensity to form extended \\xc3\\xa2-strand structures, we wondered whether amyloid assemblies of an EF-hand protein were able to influence calcium carbonate crystallization in vitro. Here, we used the Gad m 1 chain as a model to generate monomeric and amyloid assemblies and to analyze their effect on calcite formation in vitro. We found that only amyloid assemblies alter calcite morphology. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'The article is focused on the role of nanohydroxy apatite (nHAp) and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as fillers in the electrospun poly (vinyl alcohol) (ES-PVA) nanofibers for bone tissue engineering (TE). Fibrous scaffolds of PVA, PVA/nHAp (10 wt.%), and PVA/nHAp(10 wt.%)/CNF(3 wt.%) were successfully fabricated and characterized. Tensile test on electrospun PVA/nHAp10 and PVA/nHAp10/CNF3 revealed a three-fold and seven-fold increase in modulus compared with pure ES-PVA (45.45\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x894.77). Although, nanofiller loading slightly reduced the porosity percentage, all scaffolds had porosity higher than 70%. In addition, contact angle test proved the great hydrophilicity of scaffolds. The presence of fillers reduced in vitro biodegradation rate in PBS while accelerates biomineralization in simulated body fluid (SBF). Furthermore, cell viability, cell attachment, and functional activity of osteoblast MG-63 cells were studied on scaffolds showing higher cellular activity for scaffolds with nanofillers. Generally, the obtained results confirm that the 3-componemnt fibrous scaffold of PVA/nHAp/CNF has promising potential in hard TE. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

b'BACKGROUND: Cultured pearls are unique gems produced by living organisms, mainly molluscs of the Pinctada genus, through the biomineralization properties of pearl sac tissue. Improvement of P. margaritifera pearl quality is one of the biggest challenges that Polynesian research has faced to date. To achieve this goal, a better understanding of the complex mechanisms related to nacre and pearl formation is essential and can now be approached through the use of massive parallel sequencing technologies. The aim of this study was to use RNA-seq to compare whole transcriptome expression of pearl sacs that had producing pearls with high and low quality. For this purpose, a comprehensive reference transcriptome of P. margaritifera was built based on multi-tissue sampling (mantle, gonad, whole animal), including different living stages (juvenile, adults) and phenotypes (colour morphotypes, sex).RESULTS: Strikingly, few genes were found to be up-regulated for high quality pearls (n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x8916) compared to the up-regulated genes in low quality pearls (n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89246). Biomineralization genes up-regulated in low quality pearls were specific to prismatic and prism-nacre layers. Alternative splicing was further identified in several key biomineralization genes based on a recent P. margaritifera draft genome.CONCLUSION: This study lifts the veil on the multi-level regulation of biomineralization genes associated with pearl quality determination. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'PURPOSE: The purpose of the present systematic review was to investigate at the histological level if a modified titanium surface abutment could affect the behaviour of soft peri-implant tissue (connective tissue adhesion and soft tissue inflammation).MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic databases research (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) until 24 June 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI) was performed. The focused question was: "In healthy patients with at least one titanium healing abutment connected to a dental implant, is the effect of a healing abutment surface modification different from machined titanium at the histological level?" The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess the risk of bias in individual studies was used for RCTs. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used to evaluate NRSI.RESULTS: In total, 192 records were evaluated for titles and abstracts. Seven studies were included in the review. Five of them reported an enhanced soft tissue adhesion in the modified abutment group without increasing the soft tissue inflammation. One study reported no significant differences among titanium-modified (double acid-etched) and titanium-machined groups. One author demonstrated at the 6-month follow-up period a higher level of inflammation around acid-etched surfaces, with a higher number of T and B lymphocytes and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term data (< 6 months) suggested an enhanced connective fibre attachment next to titanium abutments with a modified surface and a similar inflammatory response, in comparison with machined surface titanium abutments. However, modified surfaces may lead to a long-term increased risk of a higher degree of inflammation in the peri-implant tissues. Due to limited available evidence, further long-term studies are needed to confirm these results. labels: #Dental Abutments#Dental Implants#Humans#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Titanium#Tooth#Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A'
b"Objective: To investigate the clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hypertrophic port-wine stain (PWS). Methods: Cases of hypertrophic PWS, collected from Henan Provincial People's Hospital between 2012 and 2018, were retrospectively analyzed for their clinical and pathologic features, immunophenotype and histochemical data, and the relevant literature was reviewed. Results: Twenty-four cases of PWS were included in this cohort, located in the head and neck region (20 cases), limbs (2 cases), and trunk (2 cases). The clinical presentations were mainly red or purple-red plaques or slow growing, painless nodules, or thickened and raised above the skin surface. Microscopically, deformed blood vessels showed honeycomb-like, plexiform or cluster-like growth pattern, and diffusely involved the dermis, skin appendages, subcutaneous fat tissue, and deep skeletal muscles; The vascular lumen of the deformed vessels was dilated (?100 \\xc3\\xacm in diameter), and in 18 cases the lumen was greater than 400 \\xc3\\xacm. The superficial dermis mainly contained few deformed capillaries. The deep wall showed thickening of blood vessel wall and fibrous tissue hyperplasia. Elastic fiber and Masson staining indicated abnormal venous vessel, which in some cases contained small amount of abnormal arterioid vessel,without vascular endothelial cell proliferation in all cases. In 24 cases, 19 cases had epidermal atrophy, 6 with vascular chronic inflammation or epidermal ulcer, 4 with capillary hemangioma, 4 with sebaceous gland hyperplasia, 2 with epidermal papillary hyperplasia and 2 with vascular keratomas. Conclusions: PWS is a common congenital capillary malformation. The number of histologically deformed capillaries is reduced and they usually locate in the superficial part. The deep vascular wall is increased with thick venous malformation, diffusely involving the dermis and deep skeletal muscle. Furthermore, PWS needs to be differentiated from infantile hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma and vascular keratomas. labels: #Humans#Port-Wine Stain#Retrospective Studies#Skin"
b"Objective: To understand the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of chronic critical illness (CCI) in China. Methods: The clinical data of 472 adult patients admitted to ICU in 53 hospitals, including basic information, disease-related data, nutrition program, etc., were collected on May 10, 2019, by means of multi-center cross-sectional study. If surgical intervention was needed or the occurrence of the disease was directly related to the surgery, ICU patients were regarded as surgical ICU cases (n=211). In this study, the diagnostic criteria for CCI were: (1) admission to ICU >14 days;(2) combined with persistent organ dysfunction. The prevalence,distribution and treatment of CCI and surgery-related CCI were recorded and analyzed. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used for comparative analysis. Results: Among the 472 ICU patients from 53 hospitals, 326 were male (69.1%) and 146 were female (30.9%). The prevalence of CCI was 30.7% (145/472). Among 211 surgery-related ICU patients, 57 developed CCI with a prevalence of 27.0%. As compared to non-CCI patients, higher APACHE II score [median (IQR) 13.5 (10.0, 18.3) vs. 11.0 (7.0, 16.0), U=2970.000, P=0.007], higher Charlson comorbidity index [median (IQR) 4.0 (2.0, 7.0) vs. 3.0 (1.0, 5.0), U= 3570.000, P=0.036] and higher ratio of breath dysfunction [68.4% (39/57) vs. 48.1% (74/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=6.939, P=0.008] and renal dysfunction [42.1% (24/57) vs. 18.2% (28/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=12.821, P<0.001] were found in surgery-related CCI patients. While SOFA score, Glasgow coma score and other visceral function were not significantly different between surgery-related CCI and non-CCI patients (all P>0.05). NUTRIC score showed that surgery-related CCI patients had higher nutritional risk [43.9% (25/57) vs. 26.6%(41/154), U=5.750, P=0.016] and higher ratio of mechanical ventilation [66.7% (38/57) vs. 52.3% (79/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.977, P=0.046] than non-CCI patients. On the survey day, the daily caloric requirements of 50.2% (106/211) of surgery-related ICU patients were calculated according to the standard adult caloric intake index (104.6 to 125.5 kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), 1 kJ=0.239 kcal), and the daily caloric requirements of 46.4% (98/211) of patients were calculated by physicians according to the severity of the patient's condition. 60.2% (127/211) of nutritional support therapy was enteral nutrition (including a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition), while the remaining patients received parenteral nutrition (24.6%, 52/211), simple glucose infusion (9.0%, 19/211), or oral diet (6.2%, 13/211). The target calorie of CCI group was 104.6 (87.9, 125.5) kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), and the actual calorie intake accounted for 0.98 (0.80, 1.00) of the target calory. In the non-CCI group, the target calorie was 104.6 (87.9, 125.5) kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), and the actual calorie consumed accounted for 0.91 (0.66, 1.00) of the target calorie. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups (P=0.248, P=0.150). Conclusion: The prevalence of CCI and surgery-related CCI in ICU is high, along with severe complications, respiratory and renal dysfunction and mechanical ventilation. Surgical patients admitted to ICU are at high nutritional risk, and active and correct nutritional support is essential for such patients. labels: #Adult#China#Chronic Disease#Critical Illness#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intensive Care Units#Male#Nutritional Support#Surgical Procedures, Operative"
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) serum on expression of myogenic differentiation antigen (Myod) and autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 in cultured muscle satellite cells of rats under starvation conditions.METHODS: The primary multifidus muscle satellite cells of one male SD rat were isolated and cultured to obtain the 3rd generation of cells. The EA serum was got from the rat received EA stimulation of bilateral "Weizhong" (BL40, 2 Hz/10 Hz, 1 mA, duration of 20 min, once daily for 7 days). The cell suspension (2?104/well) of the 3rd generation of cultured cells was transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Twelve duplicate wells were set up for the blank control serum (without FBS), 10% FBS, 10% EA serum, 20% EA serum and 30% EA serum groups and incubated for 12 h and 24 h, respectively. Each well was supplemented with 10 \\xc2\\xb5L CCK-8 reagent to be incubated for 1 h again for observing the state of cell proliferation. After culturing the primary muscle satellite cells in serum-free medium for 12 h, the cells were randomly divided into serum-free group, 10% fetal bovine serum group and optimal concentration electroacupuncture serum group, and serum of corresponding concentration was added respectively. The expression levels of Beclin 1 and cell-proliferation-related protein Myod were detected by Western blot.RESULTS: CCK-8 assay displayed that the proliferation levels were significantly higher at 12 h and 24 h after serum intervention in the 10% FBS, 10% EA serum, 20% EA serum and 30% EA serum groups than that in the blank control serum group (P<0.01), and at 24 h in the 3 EA serum groups than in the 10% FBS group (P<0.01), but without significant difference among the three EA serum groups (P>0.05). As a result, 10% EA serum was selected as the optimal concentration for Western blot tests. No significant difference was found in the expression levels of Myod and Beclin 1 proteins among the serum-free, 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups before intervention (P>0.05), and there was a marked up-regulation of Myod expression and an obvious down-regulation of Beclin 1 expression at 12 h in both the 10% EA serum and 10% FBS groups in comparison with their own pre-intervention (P<0.05). There were a marked up-re-gulation of Myod expression at both 12 h and 24 h and Beclin 1 expression at 24 h in both the 10% EA serum group and 10% FBS group than that in the serum-free group (P<0.05), and an obvious down-regulation of Beclin 1 expression at 12 h in both 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups than that in the serum-free group (P<0.05, P<0.01). After 24 h\\\'s serum intervention, there was an increase of Myod expression and a reduction of Beclin 1 expression in both 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups compared with those after the 12 h intervention (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups in the expression levels of Myod and Beclin 1 proteins (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: EA serum can promote proliferation of cultured muscle satellite cells under starvation conditions, which is related to its functions in regulating expression of Beclin 1 and cell-proliferation-related protein Myod. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Animals#Antigens, Differentiation#Beclin-1#Electroacupuncture#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Mineralized collagen provides new solutions in the manufacture of porous scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this research, the use of biomimetic mineralization, the process of mineralization of acid soluble collagen (ASC) type I extracted from white fish (Rutilus frisii kutum) scales, in a body simulated fluid (SBF) in the presence and absence of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (SDBS) was thoroughly investigated. The formation of \\xc3\\xa2-tricalcium phosphate (\\xc3\\xa2-TCP) nanocrystals in mineralized nanocomposites was detected by XRD, TGA, and FT-IR techniques. The denaturation temperature (Td) of mineralized ASC was determined at 42.87\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb0C without surfactant, and at 70.2\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb0C with surfactant using DSC technique, which indicated a higher thermal stability of ASC without the SDBS surfactant. TEM images illustrated that the formation of \\xc3\\xa2-TCP crystals on collagen nano-fibrils was in an irregular form in the absence of surfactant while it was more regular and in the form of rectangular sheets in the presence of surfactant. The results of UV/Vis spectrophotometer for turbidity measurements during the initial step of biomineralization revealed that SDBS while accelerating the self-assembly process of collagen nano-fibrills, delayed the process of nucleation and the growth of calcium phosphate nanocrystals by increasing the kinetic energy barrier. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'A disease outbreak in 42-d-old black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon juveniles from a commercial aquaculture farm in Kerala, India, was investigated. The cause of the disease outbreak was confirmed as Vibrio parahaemolyticus by biochemical tests, PCR targeting the toxR gene and pathogenicity testing of the isolates. All of the isolates tested negative by PCR specific for V. parahaemolyticus associated with acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), implicating vibriosis unrelated to AHPND as the cause of mortality. Among the 19 isolates obtained, 2 possessed the tdh gene (coding for thermo-stable hemolysin), whereas none of the isolates possessed trh. The LD50 value of 8 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus from diseased and apparently healthy shrimp ranged from 2.7 ? 104 to 4.9 ? 105 CFU ml-1 by immersion challenge of P. monodon postlarvae. BOX-PCR and dendrogram analysis of the bacterial isolates revealed that the isolates from moribund and apparently healthy shrimp formed separate clusters, indicating that these isolates originate from separate clones. The isolates from moribund shrimp including tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus clustered together. The present study represents the first report of tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus causing disease in a shrimp farm. labels: #Animals#Aquaculture#India#Penaeidae#Vibrio parahaemolyticus'
b'Microorganisms with the function of biological mineralization were isolated from a soil. The bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA as Bacillus sp and possessed a significant lead removal ability. Lead removal experiment indicated that the mathematical model of \\xc3\\xa7=\\xc3\\xa7max-\\xc3\\xa7cet/k fit the variation of removal rate with time well. Different from the previous studies, this work discovered that the culture medium had the ability to remove aqueous lead (Pb2+). At the same dosage, the removal rates of Pb2+ followed the order of: cells\\xe2\\x80\\xaf<\\xe2\\x80\\xafculture medium\\xe2\\x80\\xaf<\\xe2\\x80\\xafmetabolites\\xe2\\x80\\xaf<\\xe2\\x80\\xafbacterial suspension. The lead removal mechanism was further explored using the techniques of XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The results showed that during the fermentation, the bacteria decomposed phosphate-containing organic compounds in the culture medium to generate a large amount of phosphate groups on the surface of the bacterial cells. Pb2+ was precipitated in the form of Pb3(PO4)2 stable minerals. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW)-to-platelet count (PLT) ratio (RPR) on the first day of admission into the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in predicting the prognosis of children with sepsis.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 186 children with sepsis who were hospitalized in the PICU. According to their prognosis, they were divided into a survival group with 151 children and a death group with 35 children. Clinical data were compared between the two groups. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the prognosis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the value of RPR in predicting death. The children were divided into a high RPR group and a low RPR group according to the optimal cut-off value, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the 28-day survival rate between the two groups.RESULTS: Compared with the survival group, the death group had significantly higher RDW, procalcitonin (PCT) and RPR (P<0.05) and significantly lower PLT and albumin (ALB) (P<0.05). The Cox regression model analysis showed that low ALB, high PCT and high RPR were independent risk factors for the prognosis of children with sepsis (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that RPR had a certain value in predicting the prognosis of children with sepsis (P<0.05), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.937, an optimal cut-off value of 0.062, a sensitivity of 94.29%, and a specificity of 77.48%. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high RPR group had a significantly lower 28-day survival rate than the low RPR group (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: RPR on the first day of admission into the PICU is closely associated with the prognosis of children with sepsis and has an important value in predicting the prognosis of children with sepsis. labels: #Child#Erythrocytes#Humans#Platelet Count#Prognosis#ROC Curve#Retrospective Studies#Sepsis'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression level of silencing information regulatory 2 (SIRT2) in cervical cancer and CIN tissues and its clinical significance.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was carried out to examine the expression of SIRT2 in 262 cases of cervical cancer tissues, 75 cases of precancerous lesions and 75 cases of normal cervical tissues, and the clinical implications of SIRT2 was further analyzed. The protein expression level of SIRT2 in 40 cervical cancer fresh tissue samples and 20 normal cervical tissue samples was detected by Western blot. shRNA-SIRT2 virus was transfected into HeLa cells to obtain the SIRT2-down-regulated HeLa cells. And the influence of down-regulation of SIRT2 on cell proliferation and migration was investigated by MTT and Scratch test.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical results showed that SIRT2 protein expression level gradually increased in cervical cancer, CIN and normal cervix tissues (P < 0.001). Western blot confirmed that SIRT2 expression level was higher in cervical cancer tissues than in normal cervix tissues (P < 0.001). The expression level of SIRT2 in cervical cancer was correlated with some factors, such as lymph node metastasis, histological type, clinical staging and HPV infection (P < 0.05). At the same time, it was independent of some factors including age, differentiation degree, pelvic metastasis, whether involving the cervical interstitial and the involvement depth and whether involving the neck junction and vaginal ends (P>0.05). Mortality in SIRT2 high expression patient group was higher than that of SIRT2 low expression patient group (P < 0.05). shRNA interference technique could effectively inhibit the expression level of SIRT2 in HeLa cells (P < 0.05). MTT assay and Scratch test indicated that down-regulation of SIRT2 expression inhibited the proliferation and migration of HeLa cells (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: SIRT2 may play a promoting role in the progress of cervical cancer, and SIRT2 may be related to the development of malignant degree of cervical cancer, and the inhibition of SIRT2 expression may be a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. labels: #Cell Proliferation#Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia#Female#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#HeLa Cells#Humans#Lymphatic Metastasis#Sirtuin 2#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b'Although bioactive glasses have been traditionally used in the clinical practice for a long period, their uncontrollable architecture and poor mechanical robustness remains a neck bottle for further biomedical applications. In this study, we firstly developed a series of mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) nanorods with different aspect ratios and adjustable pore sizes via a thermal-mediation approach. The nanorods were then dispersed in MBG sol, followed by impregnation with sponge and in situ gelation. After sinter treatment, the sponge template was removed to offer interconnected macroporous structure, while the intercross-linked MBG nanorods afford meso- and micro- pores. The resulting scaffolds presented a 2-fold reinforcement in compressive strength (1.03\\xe2\\x80\\x89MPa) which is matchable to that of cancellous bone. When their mesopore size was tuned to 7.38\\xe2\\x80\\x89nm, the scaffolds enabled an optimal protein adsorption capacity and sustainable release property. Upon 3-day incubation in simulated body fluid, the scaffolds with macro/meso/micro porous structure present more needle-like hydroxyapatites, indicating their promoted biomineralization capacity. After culture with rat bone marrow stromal cells for 1 day, the hierarchical porous scaffolds displayed good cell attachment and proliferation ability, suggesting their potential as a kind of scaffolds for tissue engineering. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Green synthesis of precise inorganic nanomaterials is a major challenge. Magnetotactic bacteria biomineralise magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) within membrane vesicles (magnetosomes), which are embedded with dedicated proteins that control nanocrystal formation. Some such proteins are used in vitro to control MNP formation in green synthesis; however, these membrane proteins self-aggregate, making their production and use in vitro challenging and difficult to scale. Here, we provide an alternative solution by displaying active loops from biomineralisation proteins Mms13 and MmsF on stem-loop coiled-coil scaffold proteins (Mms13cc/MmsFcc). These artificial biomineralisation proteins form soluble, stable alpha-helical hairpin monomers, and MmsFcc successfully controls the formation of MNP when added to magnetite synthesis, regulating synthesis comparably to native MmsF. This study demonstrates how displaying active loops from membrane proteins on coiled-coil scaffolds removes membrane protein solubility issues, while retains activity, enabling a generic approach to readily-expressible, versatile, artificial membrane proteins for more accessible study and exploitation. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of "Buqi Yixue "needling on clinical symptoms, neurological function and nerve conduction velocity in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.METHODS: Eighty-six patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy numbness and pain were equally randomized into control group and treatment group. The patients of the control group received basic treatment and oral administration of Cilostazol (50 mg/time, 2 times/d) and Epalrestat (50 mg/time, 3 times/d). The patients of the treatment group received acupuncture stimulation of Danzhong (CV17), Qihai (CV6), Pishu (BL20), Quchi (LI11), etc., for 30 min, once every day, on the basic treatment. The treatment was conducted for 8 successive weeks. The scores of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptoms, Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were detected before and after the treatment.RESULTS: After the treatment, the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS were considerably decreased (P<0.05), and the NCV was significantly increased (P<0.05) in both groups compared with those of their own pre-treatment. The the-rapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in lowering the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS, and in up-regulating the NCV (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: "Buqi Yixue" needling is effective in improving clinical symptoms and increasing NCV in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Arteries#Diabetes Mellitus#Diabetic Neuropathies#Humans#Medicine, Chinese Traditional#Neural Conduction'
b'Objective: To assess clinical features and treatment outcomes in immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Methods: Sixty-two patients with PCNSL who attended Guangdong General Hospital between January 1998 and January 2012 were included. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival methodology and statistical significance of continuous was assessed via the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The median age of the patient cohort was 56 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.14?1.00. The common presentations were increased intracranial pressure symptoms and neuron damage. Performance status of 54 (54/62, 87.1%) patients were the international prognostic index (IPI) 0-2. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (57/62, 91.9%) was most common, and the rest were T-cell lymphoma (4/62,6.4%) and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (1/62, 1.6%). In the series, 32 patients (32/62, 51.6%) had multiple lesions. Involvement of deep structures was found in 30 (30/62, 48.4%) patients. An elevated serum LDH level was detected in 19 (19/62, 30.6%) patients and the Ki-67 index was ?90% in 38 (38/62, 61.3%) patients. Univariate analysis showed patients who were female, age<60 years, had WHO Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status grade 0-2, single lesion, absence of deep structures involvement and normal LDH level showed better 2-year survival rate and longer median survival time. Significance was only seen in the normal LDH level group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that radical surgery only and Rituximab+ high-dose of methotrexate+ whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) were independent prognostic indicators in PCNSL patients (P<0.05). Conclusions: PCNSL is a rare but aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Patients treated with high-dose of methotrexate combining with rituximab, followed by WBRT have a better prognosis and longer survival time, and thus these could probably be a promising treatment. labels: #Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Central Nervous System Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse#Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b'This retrospective study investigated the effect of the novel bone graft transverse process strut (TPS) in single segmental thoracic spinal tuberculosis (TB) with the one-stage posterior approach of debridement, fusion, and internal instrumentation. Thirty patients treated in our department from March 2014 to October 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Surgical time, blood loss, hospitalization time, drainage volume, and follow-up (FU) duration were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, segmental angle, and bone fusion were compared between preoperative and final FU. All the patients were followed for a mean 50.10\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a25.10 months; the mean age, surgical time in minutes, blood loss, hospitalization time, and drainage volume were 46.23\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a17.20 years, 195.08\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a24.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes, 280.77\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a189.90\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, 17.31\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a4.23 days, 436.92\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a193.81\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, respectively.

b'Objective: To investigate the prognostic values of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) calculated from pretreatment (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET-CT results of patients with advanced extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Methods: The clinic data, follow-up data and pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET-CT data of 45 patients with ENKTL of stage ? were collected. The optimal cutoff value of progression-free survival (PFS) of SUV(max), MTV and TLG were analyzed by using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Kaplan-Meier method, Log-rank test and COX proportional hazards model were used for survival analysis, univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, respectively. Results: The median SUV(max), MTV and TLG of 45 ENKTL patients were 17.98, 70.18 and 755.42, respectively. ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SUV(max), MTV and TLG were 0.504 (P=0.970), 0.868 (P<0.001) and 0.848 (P=0.001), respectively. The value of SUV(max) was too small to fit for calculating the cutoff value of AUC. The cutoff value of MTV was 42.54 (sensitivity =78.1% and specificity =84.6%), and the cutoff value of TLG was 435.15 (sensitivity=75.0% and specificity =76.9%). Univariate analysis showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, epstein-barr virus (EBV)-DNA, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, bone marrow, Korean prognostic index (KPI), MTV, TLG were significantly related with PFS (all P<0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, EBV-DNA, ECOG score, primary tumor location, KPI, MTV, TLG were significantly related with overall survival (OS) (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that KPI, MTV and TLG were independent prognostic predictors of PFS and OS (all P<0.05). Conclusions: MTV and TLG of pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET-CT are independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS of patients with advanced ENKTL. MTV and TLG may be more fit for evaluating the prognosis of ENKTL patients than SUV(max). labels: #Fluorodeoxyglucose F18#Glycolysis#Humans#Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell#Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography#Positron-Emission Tomography#Prognosis#Progression-Free Survival#Radiopharmaceuticals#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Tumor Burden'
b'In this paper, the influence of humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) on biomineralization behaviour was evaluated. The results showed HA and FA did not obviously inhabit or promote the precipitation of U-phosphate minerals. The data from molecular dynamic simulation indicated that the free energy for the dissociation of uranyl the PO43- -uranyl was 202.49\\xe2\\x80\\xafkJ/mol, which was much larger than that form HA-uranyl (88.3\\xe2\\x80\\xafkJ/mol). These simulated results revealed the less competitiveness of HA and FA with PO43- for uranyl and explained why HA and FA had less impacted on the formation of U-phosphate minerals. However, the influence of HA/FA on the morphology was obvious, the microstructure of the bio-minerals changed from small particles to lamellar stacking structure with the addition of HA or FA. The findings of this study are helpful for us to gain a better understanding natural U-phosphate biomineralization behaviour. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Pursuing the widespread interest on multi-target drugs to combat Alzheimer?s disease (AD), a new series of hybrids was designed and developed based on the repositioning of the well-known acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, tacrine (TAC), by its coupling to benzofuran (BF) derivatives. The BF framework aims to endow the conjugate molecules with ability for inhibition of AChE (bimodal way) and of amyloid-beta peptide aggregation, besides providing metal (Fe, Cu) chelating ability and concomitant extra anti-oxidant activity, for the hybrids with hydroxyl substitution. The new TAC-BF conjugates showed very good activity for AChE inhibition (sub-micromolar range) and good capacity for the inhibition of self- and Cu-mediated A\\xc3\\xa2 aggregation, with dependence on the linker size and substituent groups of each main moiety. Neuroprotective effects were also found for the compounds through viability assays of neuroblastoma cells, after A\\xc3\\xa21-42 induced toxicity. Structure-activity relationship analysis provides insights on the best structural parameters, to take in consideration for future studies in view of potential applications in AD therapy. labels: #Acetylcholinesterase#Alzheimer Disease#Animals#Benzofurans#Cholinesterase Inhibitors#Dose-Response Relationship, Drug#Electrophorus#Humans#Models, Molecular#Molecular Structure#Neuroprotective Agents#Structure-Activity Relationship#Tacrine'
b'Objective To prepare biomimetic bone material by reconstructing type ? collagen combined with polyaspartic acid. Methods By acid hydrolysis,rat tail type ? collagen was decomposed into collagen fibers,which were then placed in the calcium phosphate mineralization solution. Under the cross-linking of glutaraldehyde,the collagen fibers were reconstructed and assembled into collagen fibers,and the calcium phosphate crystals were wrapped in the inner side of the collagen fibers for biomineralizationin. After poly aspartate acid was added,calcium hydroxyapatite calcium precursor was added into the collagen fibers to simulate thebiomimetic biomineralizationin the human body. After mineralization for 3-9 days,the bone mineralization process was observed by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Results Transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction displayed that,after 3 days of mineralization,calcium hydroxyapatite precursor was wrapped in the collagen fiber gap,and the collagen fiber was partially mineralized. After 9 days of mineralization,calcium hydroxyapatite precursor completely infiltrated into the collagen fiber,and the amorphous calcium phosphate was transformed into hydroxyapatite calcium crystal. Thus,the simulation of bone mineralization was completed,and collagen type ? collagen/hydroxyapatite calcium biomimetic bone material was formed. Conclusion Reconstruction of type ? collagen combined with polyaspartic acid can prepare biomimetic bone material that has close chemical composition and molecular structure to the human bone tissue. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'\\n             Sub-Saharan Africa is home of 85 % of pregnant women living with HIV and 90 % of HIV-infected children. WHO issued the first prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) recommendations in 2000. These guidelines have been revised to incorporate new evidence and align with the goal of universal treatment access and zero infections among children. Currently, 82 % of HIV-infected pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment, and infections among children have halved since 2010. However, in 2018, 160,000 children became infected. Reasons hindering the success of PMTCT are: a) non-universal HIV testing during pregnancy; b) low retention through the PMTCT cascade; and c) missed opportunities to diagnose women who acquire HIV while pregnant or breastfeeding. To address these gaps innovative strategies are needed.\\n           labels: #Anti-HIV Agents#Child#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical#Mass Screening#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Complications, Infectious'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Large Intestine of Hand-Yangming, Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming and the Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, so as to explore the positive reaction points at the body surface of allergic rhinitis.METHODS: Thirty variant rhinitis volunteer subjects and 30 healthy subjects were recruited in the present study. The subcutaneous induration, reaction points of emptiness-like feeling or pressing pain below the elbow- and knee-joints along the Large Intestine Meridian, Stomach Meridian and the Lung Meridian were inspected first, then re-examined by using heat-sensitized moxibustion method and a hand-held pain threshold tester (mechanical pressure), respectively. The frequency and coincidence rate of pressing-pain sensitive and heat-sensitive points were analyzed.RESULTS: In the 30 patients with allergic rhinitis, 10 positive reaction points as Kongzui (LU6), Chize (LU5), Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Shousanli(LI10), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Fenglong (ST40), Xiajuxu (ST39), and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian were found. Among them, the duration of heat-sensitive reaction in the LU6, LI10, ST37, ST40, and ST39 regions was obviously shorter in patients than in healthy subjects (P<0.01,P<0.005). The heat-sensitive forms of the positive reaction points were mainly heat transmission, heat-penetration and local reaction. The mechanical pain thresholds of the positive reaction points (LI4, LU6, LI10, LI11 and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian) at the upper limbs and those (ST36, ST37 and ST40) at the lower limbs were evidently lower in patients than in healthy volunteer subjects (P<0.05). The pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints were basically coincide in the patients, but being higher in patients than in healthy subjects in the frequency of occurrence. The mechanical pain threshold of the pressure-sensitive acupoints in patients was remarkably lower on the left side than on the right side of the upper limb, and obviously higher on the left side than on the right side of the lower limb (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the right and left sides in the pain threshold in healthy subjects (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: There is a high overlap in the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Lung, Large Intestine and Stomach meridians below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, and there is an imbalance between the left and right limbs in the mechanical pain threshold of the pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints, but needing being further confirmed. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Hot Temperature#Humans#Meridians#Moxibustion#Rhinitis, Allergic'
b'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a biologically active dental implant surface (treated with sandblasting and acid etching [SLA] followed by immersion in simulated body fluid [SBF]) on osseointegration.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomly divided 9 healthy adult male beagles (aged 8\\xc2\\xa0months; body weight, 12\\xc2\\xa0kg) into 3 groups: machined, SLA, and SLA-biomineralization (SLA-Bio). Six pure titanium implants (diameter of 3.5\\xc2\\xa0mm and length of 8\\xc2\\xa0mm) were used in the mandible of each dog after observation of the surface morphology, as well as analysis of the composition of the surface elements by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. At 4, 8, and 12\\xc2\\xa0weeks after implantation, animals were euthanized to collect the mandibles so that we could perform the removal torque test to evaluate the implant stability in bone and histomorphometry to analyze the implant-bone osseointegration.RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy results showed that uniformly distributed sponge-like structures were found on the SLA-treated surface and an apatite layer was observed on the SLA-SBF-treated surface (SLA-Bio group). In the energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis, the elements titanium, oxygen, carbon, calcium, and phosphorus were found on the surfaces of the SLA-Bio group, whereas titanium was the only element found in the other groups.\\xc2\\xa0The removal torque test showed that the peak removal torque values of the 3 groups increased gradually with the passage of time, and the peak removal torque values of the SLA-Bio group were significantly higher than those of the other groups (P\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.01) at 4, 8, and 12\\xc2\\xa0weeks after implantation. Histomorphometric analysis showed that osseointegration was being enabled more rapidly in the SLA-Bio group, as well as that the mineral apposition rate and percentage of bone-to-implant contact of the SLA-Bio group were higher than those of the remaining groups at 4, 8, and 12\\xc2\\xa0weeks after implantation (P\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Treating titanium implants with SLA-SBF can improve osseointegration as well as increase the interfacial shear strength. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of osteogenic differentiation and the expression of histone demethylases KDM6B in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in diabetic environment.METHODS: Diabetic model rats was successfully established, and BMSCs from diabetic model rats and normal rats were isolated and cultured for further study. When cultured cells, we added high concentration of glucose and advanced glycosylation products (AGE) in the medium to imitating the diabetic environment. BMSCs were divided into 6 groups: diabetes group (derived from diabets SD rats), normal group (derived from normal SD rats), high glucose group (30 mmol/L D-glucose), normal glucose group (5.5 mmol/L D-glucose), AGE group (AGE 300 \\xc3\\xacg/mL) and BSA group (BSA 300 \\xc3\\xacg/mL). BMSCs in diabetes group were derived from diabetes SD rats, while others were derived from normal SD rats. After 7 d of osteogenic induction, the cells were examined the ability of osteogenic differentiation by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, the transcription levels of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and KDM6B were determined by RT-PCR, and the expression levels of H3K27Me3 protein were examined by Western bolt.RESULTS: Compared with the control groups, the numbers of ALP stained cells and the mRNA levels of Runx2 and KDM6B in diabetes group, high glucose group and AGE group were all decreased (P < 0.05), while H3K27Me3 protein expression levels were all increased (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The ability of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in diabetic environment was weakened, and the expression of Runx2 mRNA was inhibited, which may be related to the increased expression of H3K27Me3 after the inhibition of KDM6B expression. labels: #Animals#Bone Marrow Cells#Cell Differentiation#Cells, Cultured#Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit#Diabetes Mellitus#Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases#Mesenchymal Stem Cells#Osteoblasts#Osteogenesis#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupunctur (EA) and moxibustion of left or right "Tian-shu" (ST25) on intragastric pressure (IGP) in normal rats.METHODS: Twenty male SD rats were equally and randomly divided into EA group and moxibustion group. EA (2 Hz/15 Hz, 2 mA) or moxibustion (46-48 ?) was applied to unilate-ral ST25 for 2 min. The IGP was detected by using a pressure-transducer and an amplifier before and after EA or moxibustion.RESULTS: Compared with pre-intervention, the IGP was significantly decreased after EA or moxibustion stimulation of both left and right ST25 (P<0.05). The IGP levels during 0-30 s and 30-60 s of EA stimulation of both left and right ST25 were significantly lower than those of moxibustion (P<0.05). The IGP-lowering effect of EA on the left ST25 was evidently stronger than that of the right ST25 (P<0.05), but without significant difference between the bilateral sides in moxibustion-induced IGP reduction (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: Both EA and moxibustion of ST25 can lower IGP, and the effect of EA is significantly stronger than that of moxibustion in normal rats. In addition, the IGP-lowering effect of EA of the left ST25 is markedly stronger than that of the right ST25, suggesting a lateral advantage effect. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Moxibustion#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Genomes of photoautotrophic organisms containing type I photosynthetic reaction center were searched for the rnf genes encoding Na+-translocating ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase (RNF). These genes were absent in heliobacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, and plants; however, genomes of many green sulfur bacteria (especially marine ones) were found to contain the full rnf operon. Analysis of RNA isolated from the marine green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeovibrioides revealed a high level of rnf expression. It was found that the activity of Na+-dependent flavodoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase detected in the membrane fraction of Chl. phaeovibrioides was absent in the membrane fraction of the freshwater green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum limnaeum, which is closely related to Chl. phaeovibrioides but whose genome lacks the rnf genes. Illumination of the membrane fraction of Chl. phaeovibrioides but not of Cba. limnaeum resulted in the light-induced NAD+ reduction. Based on the obtained data, we concluded that in some green sulfur bacteria, RNF may be involved in the NADH formation that should increase the efficiency of light energy conservation in these microorganisms and can serve as the first example of the use of Na+ energetics in photosynthetic electron transport chains. labels: #Bacterial Proteins#Chlorobi#Electron Transport#Light#NAD#Oxidoreductases#Photosynthesis#Recombinant Proteins'
b'This work shows that calcareous benthic foraminifera are capable of agglutinating sedimentary particles also. In particular, we focus on Melonis barleeanus. Traditionally considered a calcareous species, our data revealed the presence of minute (~3\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\xacm) sedimentary particles (silicate grains) inside the chamber walls of the examined shells. These particles were arranged in a definitive and systematic pattern, and the similar grain chemical characterization and size suggested a relatively high degree of selectivity in both modern and fossil specimens. Based on these results, we propose that M. barleeanus is capable of agglutinating sedimentary particles during the formation of a new chamber. The analysis of other calcareous foraminiferal species (e.g., Cassidulina neoteretis, Lobatula lobatula, Nonionella stella) did not reveal the presence of silicate grains in the shell of the specimens analyzed confirming this to be a characteristic of M. barleeanus. Considering that the isotopic and chemical composition of this species is widely used in paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic reconstructions, we used a mixing model to better constrain the influence of sedimentary particles on M. barleeanus \\xc3\\xa418O data. Our model showed that the calcite \\xc3\\xa418O would increase by ~0.9-2\\xe2\\x80\\xb0 if 10\\xe2\\x80\\x89wt% of feldspars (i.e., anorthite, albite, orthoclase) and quartz, respectively, were included in the analyzed shell. Based on these results, we emphasize that it is of paramount importance to consider M. barleeanus unusual biomineralization strategy during the interpretation of geological records and to investigate the presence of similar processes in other calcareous foraminiferal species. labels: #Biomineralization'

b'Objective: To explore the resistance mechanism and gene type of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn care unit. Methods: A total of 27 CRKP strains were primarily isolated from 22 patients [20 males, 2 females, aged (42\\xc2\\xb116) years] admitted to burn care unit of Institute of Burn Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University, hereinafter referred to as our department) from January to December 2017. After identification of bacteria, the months of detection and distribution of sample source were analyzed. Drug resistance tests of 15 antibiotics were conducted. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the drug resistant genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used to analyze the gene type of strains. Results: (1) During the whole year of 2017, CRKP strains were mostly detected in August (8 strains), September (6 strains), and October (5 strains), with no CRKP in January, March, June, November, and December. Five strains from bed units were detected in August (2 strains), September (1 strain), and October (2 strains). (2) Twenty-seven CRKP strains were derived from blood samples (40.7%, 11/27), wound exudate samples (18.5%, 5/27), deep vein catheter samples (11.1%, 3/27), sputum samples (7.4%, 2/27), urine samples (3.7%, 1/27), and bed unit samples (18.5%, 5/27). (3) The 27 CRKP strains were detected with drug-resistance rates of 100.0% to 7 antibiotics including cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ertapenem, and compound sulfamethoxazole, no drug-resistance to tigecycline, with drug-resistance rates higher than 81.0% to the rest 7 antibiotics. (4) Detection rates for resistance gene bla(CTX-M-10), bla(SHV), bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(ACT), and bla(KPC) were all above 92.5%. (5) According to PFGE, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 types (A, A(1), A(2), B, C, and D). Strains of type A were mainly detected in February, May, and September, with detection rate of 37.0% (10/27). Strains of type C were mainly detected in July, August, and October, with detection rate of 48.1% (13/27). Strains of types A(1), A(2), B, and D were scatteredly detected, with detection rate of 3.7% (1/27) respectively. According to MLST, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 STs. ST11 was the most frequent type, accounting for 74.1% (20/27), which was detected in August to October. The detection rate of ST395, ST2230, ST215, ST260, and STnew ranged from 3.7%(1/27) to 7.4%(2/27), and the strains were scatteredly detected. Conclusions: The main source of CRKP from burn care unit of our department was bloodstream. All the CRKP strains showed high drug-resistance rate and complicated resistance mechanism. There were small scale outbreaks caused by CRKP of type A, type C, and ST11, which should be paid more attention to in clinical treatment and infection control. labels: #Adult#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Burn Units#Burns#Carbapenems#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Female#Humans#Klebsiella Infections#Klebsiella pneumoniae#Male#Microbial Sensitivity Tests#Middle Aged#Multilocus Sequence Typing#beta-Lactamases'
b'The solid-state photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) effect has been studied in a quinone-depleted uniformly (u-)13C,15N-labeled photosynthetic reaction center (RC) protein from purple bacterium Rhodobacter (R.) sphaeroides wild type (WT). As a method for investigation, solid-state 15N NMR under magic-angle spinning (MAS) is applied under both continuous illumination (steady state) and nanosecond-laser flashes (time-resolved). While all previous 15N photo-CIDNP MAS NMR studies on the purple bacterial RC used the carotenoid-less mutant R26, this is the first using WT samples. The absence of further photo-CIDNP mechanisms (compared to R26) and various couplings (compared to 13C NMR experiments on 13C-labeled samples) allows the simplification of the spin-system. We report 15N signals of the three cofactors forming the spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) and, based on density-functional theory calculations, their assignment. The simulation of photo-CIDNP intensities and time-resolved 15N photo-CIDNP MAS NMR data matches well to the frame of the mechanistic interpretation. Three spin-chemical processes, namely, radical pair mechanism, three spin mixing, and differential decay, generate emissive (negative) 15N polarization in the singlet decay channel and absorptive (positive) polarization in the triplet decay channel of the SCRP. The absorptive 15N polarization of the triplet decay channel is transiently obscured during the lifetime of the triplet state of the carotenoid (3Car); therefore, the observed 15N signals are strongly emissive. Upon decay of 3Car, the transiently obscured polarization becomes visible by reducing the excess of emissive polarization. After the decline of 3Car, the remaining nuclear hyperpolarization decays with nuclear T1 relaxation kinetics. labels: #Models, Molecular#Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular#Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins#Protein Conformation#Rhodobacter sphaeroides'
b'Scar contracture after burn on the back of hand can easily lead to the limitation of flexion function of fingers, which seriously affects daily life activities. Generally, comprehensive rehabilitation treatment is adopted for scar contracture on the back of hand, among which wearing braces is an effective treatment method. However, some braces will limit the normal finger joints or must wait until all the affected fingers heal before they can be worn, and the wearing operation is quite complicated. In order to solve these problems, the author designed and made a finger flexion band, which was used to stretch the patients with limited flexion of finger caused by scar contracture after burn on the back of hand, and achieved good therapeutic effect. According to the measured hand size, the finger flexion band is cut and spliced from the fabric commonly used in daily life. The finger flexion band is designed with finger sleeve, which will not limit the normal finger joints, can interfere with the healed finger in advance, fix the corresponding fingers better, and improve the treatment comfort, especially for children who do not cooperate with the braces wearing. This finger flexion band is simple to make, cheap, convenient to use, and suitable for clinical promotion. labels: #Burns#Cicatrix#Contracture#Fingers#Hand Injuries#Humans#Orthotic Devices'
b'Objective: To investigate the incidence and related risk factors of ulnar nerve dysfunction after open reduction and internal fixation of humeral intercondylar fractures. Methods: A total of 168 patients who underwent open reduction and plate and screw fixation of a humeral intercondylar fracture between January 2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 85 males and 83 females, aged from 14 to 77 years with a mean age of (43\\xc2\\xb117) years. Diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy was defined as documentation of sensory and motor dysfunction of the ulnar nerve in the medical record. The explanatory (independent) variables included age, gender, injury type, AO typing, time from injury to surgery, surgery approach, plates fixation methods and whether the nerve was transposed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction. Results: Acute injury-related ulnar nerve neuropathy was diagnosed in 12(7.1%) of 168 patients. Among the other 156 patients without preoperative ulnar nerve neuropathy,the total postoperative ulnar neuropathy was found in 52 patients (33.3%), and in 26(16.7%) at the final follow-up, according to the McGowan grades system; 23(88.5%) of 26 patients were clinically graded as grade 1, and 3(11.5%) were graded as grade 2. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that triceps sparing approach (OR=2.639, P=0.039) and parallel double plate fixation (OR=3.089, P=0.046) were associated with a risk of postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction. Conclusion: There is a substantial incidence of postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction after open reduction and plate and screw fixation of humeral intercondylar fracture, postoperative ulnar neuropathy may occur from the time of injury through the long-term follow-up period, triceps sparing approach and parallel double plate fixation are the risk factors for ulnar neuropathy. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bone Plates#Female#Fracture Fixation, Internal#Humans#Humeral Fractures#Humerus#Incidence#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Treatment Outcome#Ulnar Nerve#Young Adult'
b'PURPOSE: To analyse and compare the dimensional changes of unassisted extraction sockets with alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) techniques and investigate any factors that impact the resorption of the alveolar bone.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs). All data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed for the changes in all buccolingual ridge width, midbuccal and midlingual ridge height, and mesial and distal ridge height, and horizontal width at reference points apical to the crestal area.RESULTS: Based on 14 RCTs, the effectiveness of ARP in reducing the dimensions of the postextraction alveolar socket was confirmed. The clinical magnitude of this effect was 1.95 mm in the buccolingual ridge width, 1.62 mm in the midbuccal ridge height, and 1.26 mm on the midlingual ridge height. Additionally, 0.45 mm and 0.34 mm for mesial and distal ridge height, and 1.21 mm, and 0.76 mm for ridge width changes at points 3 and 5 mm apical to the crest were noted. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the reflection of flaps and primary wound coverage during ARP may have detrimental effects on bone remodelling, while no statistical significance was observed for any of the bone graft substitutes or the percentage of molar sockets.CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the protocol, ARP can only minimise ridge resorption. ARP is most effective on horizontal ridge width, providing the most benefit coronally (approximating the crest), followed by the midbuccal ridge height. labels: #Alveolar Process#Alveolar Ridge Augmentation#Consensus#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Tooth Extraction#Tooth Socket'
b'Internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) metastasis forms the part of the N-staging of breast cancer, and affects the treatment program and prognosis. At present, IMLN metastasis is clinically diagnosed by anatomical imaging, functional imaging and postoperative pathology. Anatomical imaging includes ultrasound, CT and MRI. Functional image includes positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT), PET-MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SPECT-CT. Because of the special location of the internal mammary region and the complex anatomical structure around it, the imaging diagnosis rate and pathological diagnosis rate of IMLN are often different. Therefore, it is important to identify the relevant factors of IMLN metastasis for guiding the local treatment of internal mammary region, including the scope of surgery and radiotherapy. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Humans#Incidence#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Metastasis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Neoplasm Staging#Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography#Risk Factors#Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography'
b'Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like activities (nanozymes) have emerged as promising agents for cancer theranostics strategies. However, size-controllable synthesis of nanozymes and their targeting modifications are still challenging. Here, we report a monodispersed ferritin-based cobalt nanozyme (HccFn(Co3O4)) that specifically targets and visualizes clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. The cobalt nanozyme is biomimetically synthesized within the protein shell of the HCC-targeted ferritin (HccFn) nanocage, which is enabled by the display of HCC cell-specific peptide SP94 on the surface of ferritin through a genetic engineering approach. The intrinsic peroxidase-like activity of HccFn(Co3O4) nanozymes catalyzes the substrates to make color reaction to visualize HCC tumor tissues. We examined 424 clinical HCC specimens and verified that HccFn(Co3O4) nanozymes distinguish HCC tissues from normal liver tissues with a sensitivity of 63.5% and specificity of 79.1%, which is comparable with that of the clinically used HCC-specific marker \\xc3\\xa1 fetoprotein. Moreover, the pathological analysis indicates that the HccFn(Co3O4) nanozyme staining result is a potential predictor of prognosis in HCC patients. Staining intensity is positively correlated to tumor differentiation degree ( P = 0.0246) and tumor invasion ( P < 0.0001) and negatively correlated with overall survival ( P = 0.0084) of HCC patients. Together, our study demonstrates that ferritin is an excellent platform for size-controllable synthesis and targeting modifications of nanozymes, and the HccFn(Co3O4) nanozyme is a promising reagent for prognostic diagnosis of HCC. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'A healthy 52-year-old woman presented with 10-days history of back pain. Neurologic testing failed to detect any functional deficits in the upper and lower extremities, and the patient had a full range of cervical spine motion without associated pain. Spinal CT and MRI revealed a well-circumscribed intradural mass located at conus medullaris. The operation of L1 hemilaminectomy was performed, and pathological examination discovered dilatation of sweat ducts and suggested the diagnosis of ectopic sweat duct ectasia. IHC staining in epithelia immunophenotype showed: pan-cytokeratin (PCK)(+), epithelia membrane antigen (EMA)(+), P63(+), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6)(+), gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15)(-). Intraspinal ectopic sweat duct ectasia is extremely rare, which has not been reported in the literature to date. labels: #Back Pain#Dilatation, Pathologic#Female#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Middle Aged#Spinal Cord#Sweat Glands'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the change in P wave on electrocardiogram and its diagnostic value in children and adolescents with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope (VVS-CI).METHODS: A total of 43 children and adolescents who were diagnosed with VVS-CI were enrolled as the VVS-CI group, and 43 healthy children and adolescents were enrolled as the control group. P wave duration and P wave voltage were measured by 12-lead electrocardiography in a basal state, and the changes were analyzed.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the VVS-CI group had a significantly lower heart rate (P<0.05) and significantly longer P wave duration (Pwd), P wave maximum duration (Pmax), and corrected P wave maximum duration (Pcmax), as well as significantly higher P wave dispersion (Pd) and corrected P wave dispersion (Pcd) (P<0.05). Pwd, Pmax, Pd, Pcmax and Pcd had a certain diagnostic value in children and adolescents with VVS-CI (P<0.05): Pwd had a sensitivity of 69.77% and a specificity of 83.72% at the optimal cut-off value of 78.49 ms; Pmax had a sensitivity of 76.74% and a specificity of 90.70% at the optimal cut-off value of 93.39 ms; Pd had a sensitivity of 95.35% and a specificity of 69.77% at the optimal cut-off value of 27.42 ms; Pcmax had a sensitivity of 46.51% and a specificity of 88.37% at the optimal cut-off value of 120.90 ms; Pcd had a sensitivity of 83.72% and a specificity of 72.09% at the optimal cut-off value of 36.37 ms.CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with VVS-CI have significantly increased Pwd, Pmax, Pd, Pcmax, and Pcd, which may indicate abnormal atrial electrical activity. The cut-off value of P wave has a certain diagnostic value in VVS-CI. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Electrocardiography#Heart Rate#Humans#Syncope, Vasovagal'
b'Dyspnea and exercise intolerance are usually attributed to pulmonary disease in sarcoidosis patients. However, cardiac involvement may also be responsible for these symptoms. Data regarding the impact of heart involvement on lung function in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is limited.The aim of study was to compare the results of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with and without heart involvement. We performed a retrospective analysis of PFTs in a group of sarcoidosis patients both with and without heart involvement evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study. The study was performed in the period between May 2008 and April 2016.We included data of sarcoidosis patients who underwent testing for possible CS (including CMR study) at a national tertiary referral center for patients with interstitial lung diseases. All patients had histopathologicaly confirmed sarcoidosis and underwent standard evaluation with PFTs measurements including spirometry, plethysmography, lung transfer factor (TL,CO), and 6-minute walking test (6MWT) assessed using the most recent predicted values.We identified 255 sarcoidosis patients (93 women, age 42\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a10.7 y): 103 with CS and 152 without CS (controls). CS patients had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 56.9\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a7.0 vs 60.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a5.4, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Any type of lung dysfunction was seen in 63% of CS patients compared with 31% in the controls (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.005). Ventilatory disturbances (obstructive or restrictive pattern) and low TL,CO were more frequent in CS group (52% vs 23%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001 and 38% vs 18% P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.01 respectively).

There was a significant correlation between LVEF and FEV1 in CS group (r\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.31, n\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a89, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.003). No significant difference in 6MWD between CS patients and controls was observed.Lung function impairment was more frequent in CS. Lower LVEF was associated with decreased values of FEV1.

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on behavioral changes, and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \\xc3\\xa1-synuclein(\\xc3\\xa1-syn), transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6) and transcription factor X box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) in the substantia nigra of Parkinson\\\'s disease (PD) rats, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of motor function.METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups (n=12 rats in each group). The PD model was established by subcutaneous injection of rotenone (2 mg/kg) at the neck and back, once a day for 28 days. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Fengfu" (GV16) and bilateral "Taichong" (LR3) for 20 min, once a day for 14 successive days. The voluntary motor behavioral changes (total distance, average speed, total movement time, total rest time in 8 min) were detected by open field tests. The immuno-activity of TH and \\xc3\\xa1-syn in the substantia nigra was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA detected by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR.RESULTS: Following modeling and compared with the control group, the total distance, average speed and total movement time of voluntary movement were significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the total rest time was significantly increased (P<0.01). Moreover, the expression of TH was significantly decreased (P<0.01), and that of \\xc3\\xa1-syn protein, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA significantly increased in the model group in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). After the intervention, the total distance, average speed, and total movement time of voluntary movement in the EA group were considerably higher than those in the model group (P<0.01), and the total rest time was obviously decreased in the EA group (P<0.01). The expression level of TH was significantly increased (P<0.01), and those of \\xc3\\xa1-syn, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA were notably decreased in the EA group compared with the model group (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: EA intervention can improve the locomotor function in PD model rats, which is associated with its functions in up-regulating the expression of TH protein and down-regulating the expression of \\xc3\\xa1-syn protein, and ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA in the substantia nigra of mesencephalon. labels: #Activating Transcription Factor 6#Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Parkinson Disease#RNA, Messenger#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Substantia Nigra#Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase#X-Box Binding Protein 1#alpha-Synuclein'
b"Introduction: M?ni?re's disease (MD) is a disorder that affects the inner ear, characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and vegetative symptoms. One of the main points of the management of the patients is the analysis of the vertigo diaries. Aim: To identify the typical characteristics of the symptoms and to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary approach. Material and method: 58 (12 male and 46 females, mean age 56.97 \\xc2\\xb1 10.45 SD) definite MD patients were enrolled in this investigation. The vertigo diaries filled out by the patients were analysed. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS V24 software. Since the parameters did not show normal distribution, non parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test) was used. Results: Based on the diaries, the most tormenting symptom is vertigo (mean power: 5.38 \\xc2\\xb1 2.06 SD), the second one is tinnitus (4.54 \\xc2\\xb1 2.81 SD), and last one is headache (2.77 \\xc2\\xb1 3.1 SD). Despite the frequent prevalence of associated headache, vestibular migraine could be ruled out in all of the cases. Another important outcome was that the attacks associated with headache were significantly stronger (p = 0.001). In the case of the vegetative symptoms, the association was even much stronger (p<0.01). According to the narrative analysis, the most frequent provocation factors of the attacks were the cold front and stress. Conclusion: Along with the treatment of vertigo, the management of the associated symptoms (headache, vegetative symptoms) is also of great importance. Monitoring the quality of life and psychiatric disorders suggests the importance of multidisciplinary approach.

b"Ocean acidification, a product of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, may already have affected calcified organisms in the coastal zone, such as bivalves and other shellfish. Understanding species' responses to climate change requires the context of long-term dynamics. This can be particularly difficult given the longevity of many important species in contrast with the relatively rapid onset of environmental changes. Here, we present a unique archival dataset of mussel shells from a locale with recent environmental monitoring and historical climate reconstructions. We compare shell structure and composition in modern mussels, mussels from the 1970s, and mussel shells dating back to 1000-2420\\xc2\\xa0years BP. Shell mineralogy has changed dramatically over the past 15\\xc2\\xa0years, despite evidence for consistent mineral structure in the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, over the prior 2500\\xc2\\xa0years. We present evidence for increased disorder in the calcium carbonate shells of mussels and greater variability between individuals. These changes in the last decade contrast markedly from a background of consistent shell mineralogy for centuries. Our results use an archival record of natural specimens to provide centennial-scale context for altered minerology and variability in shell features as a response to acidification stress and illustrate the utility of long-term studies and archival records in global change ecology. Increased variability between individuals is an emerging pattern in climate change responses, which may equally expose the vulnerability of organisms and the potential of populations for resilience. labels: #Biomineralization"
b"Objective: To study and analyze the incidence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in women who underwent cesarean section. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. The clinical data of the women who underwent regular antepartum examination and cesarean delivery in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2019 to June 2019 were collected, including the cervical dilatation. The incidence of POP was analyzed. Results: (1) A total of 345 women met the inclusion criteria, with cervical dilatation of 0-10 cm before cesarean section, the cervix was not dilatated in 58.6% (202/345) of the women, and the cervix was fully dilatated in 2.9% (10/345) of the women. There were 109 cases of POP stage ? or above, 13 cases of POP stage ?, and no stage ? or ?. The incidence of POP was 31.6% (109/345). (2) Statistical analysis showed that the cervical dilatation of the POP group was significantly larger than that of the non-prolapse group (median: 1.0 vs 0 cm;Z=-2.227, P=0.026). The risk of POP of vaginal trial-birth transfer to cesarean section was higher than that of elective cesarean section [42.4% (36/85) vs 28.1% (73/260), P=0.014]. However, the further analysis of Spearman correlation between cervical dilatation, elective cesarean section and POP, as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the correlation and prediction value were poor. Conclusion: Elective cesarean section has a certain protective effect on postpartum prolapse, but the protective effect of vaginal trial-birth transfer to cesarean section on pelvic floor is weakened. labels: #Cesarean Section#Cross-Sectional Studies#Delivery, Obstetric#Female#Humans#Pelvic Organ Prolapse#Postpartum Period#Pregnancy"
b'The mineralized scale derived from skin plays a protective role for the fish body and also possesses important application values in the biomaterial field. However, little is known about fish scale biomineralization and related molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here, we used a comparative microRNA sequencing approach to identify and characterize differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) involved in scale biomineralization in the naked carp Gymnocypris przewalskii. A total of 18, 43, and 66 DEMs were obtained from skin tissues covered with initial, developing, and mature scales (IS, DS, and MS) compared with scale-uncovered skin. The target genes of these DEMs were significantly enriched in a sole biomineralization-related sphingolipid signaling pathway. Seven DEMs (dre-miR-124-3p, dre-miR-133a-2-5p, dre-miR-184, dre-miR-206-3p, novel_33, novel_56 and novel_75) were common in IS, DS, and MS. Dre-miR-124-3p, dre-miR-206-3p, and novel_33 were predicted to be able to target biomineralization-related genes. Stem-loop real-time quantitative PCR further confirmed that the common DEMs had higher expression levels in scale-covered skin tissues than that in the gill, intestine, and brain, except for dre-miR-133a-2-5p. Our results suggest that these identified microRNAs may play a role in scale biomineralization in G. przewalskii, and the obtained microRNAs are expected to be candidates in understanding the molecular mechanism of scale biomineralization in fish species. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Biomineralization marks one of the most significant evolutionary milestones among the Eukarya, but its roots in the fossil record remain obscure. We report crystallographic and geochemical evidence for controlled eukaryotic biomineralization in Neoproterozoic scale microfossils from the Fifteenmile Group of Yukon, Canada. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that the microfossils are constructed of a hierarchically organized interwoven network of fibrous hydroxyapatite crystals each elongated along the [001] direction, indicating biological control over microstructural crystallization. New Re-Os geochronological data from organic-rich shale directly below the fossil-bearing limestone constrain their age to <810.7 \\xc2\\xb1 6.3 million years ago. Mineralogical and geochemical variations from these sedimentary rocks indicate that dynamic global marine redox conditions, enhanced by local restriction, may have led to an increase in dissolved phosphate in pore and bottom waters of the Fifteenmile basin and facilitated the necessary geochemical conditions for the advent of calcium phosphate biomineralization. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Re-directing mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) chondrogenesis towards a non-hypertrophic articular chondrocyte-(AC)-like phenotype is important for improving articular cartilage neogenesis to enhance clinical cartilage repair strategies. This study is the first to demonstrate that high levels of non-canonical WNT5A followed by WNT11 and LEF1 discriminated MSC chondrogenesis from AC re-differentiation. Moreover, \\xc3\\xa2-catenin seemed incompletely silenced in differentiating MSCs, which altogether suggested a role for WNT signaling in hypertrophic MSC differentiation. WNT inhibition with the small molecule IWP-2 supported MSC chondrogenesis according to elevated proteoglycan deposition and reduced the characteristic upregulation of BMP4, BMP7 and their target ID1, as well as IHH and its target GLI1 observed during endochondral differentiation. Along with the pro-hypertrophic transcription factor MEF2C, multiple hypertrophic downstream targets including IBSP and alkaline phosphatase activity were reduced by IWP-2, demonstrating that WNT activity drives BMP and hedgehog upregulation, and MSC hypertrophy. WNT inhibition almost matched the strong anti-hypertrophic capacity of pulsed parathyroid hormone-related protein application, and both outperformed suppression of BMP signaling with dorsomorphin, which also reduced cartilage matrix deposition. Yet, hypertrophic marker expression under IWP-2 remained above AC level, and in vivo mineralization and ectopic bone formation were reduced but not eliminated. Overall, the strong anti-hypertrophic effects of IWP-2 involved inhibition but not silencing of pro-hypertrophic BMP and IHH pathways, and more advanced silencing of WNT activity as well as combined application of IHH or BMP antagonists should next be considered to install articular cartilage neogenesis from human MSCs. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To explore the limb salvage strategies for patients with high voltage electric burns of extremities on the verge of amputation. Methods: From January 2003 to March 2019, 61 patients with high voltage electric burns of extremities on the verge of amputation were treated in our hospital. All of them were male, aged 15-58 years, including 49 cases of upper limbs and 12 cases of lower limbs. The wound area after thorough debridement ranged from 15 cm?11 cm to 35 cm?20 cm. Emergency surgery for reconstruction of the radial artery with saphenous vein graft under eschar was performed in 5 cases. The arteries of 36 patients (including 7 cases with simultaneous ulnar artery and radial artery reconstruction) were reconstructed with various forms of blood flow-through after debridement, among them, the radial artery of 13 cases, the ulnar artery of 8 cases, the brachial artery of 8 cases, and the femoral artery of 2 cases were reconstructed with saphenous vein graft; the radial artery of 3 cases and the ulnar artery of 7 cases were reconstructed with the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery graft; the radial artery of 2 cases were reconstructed with greater omentum vascular graft; the reflux vein of 3 cases with wrist and forearm annular electric burns were reconstructed with saphenous vein graft. According to the actual situation of the patients, 12 cases of latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, 6 cases of paraumbilical flap, 28 cases of anterolateral thigh flap, 10 cases of abdominal combined axial flap, 5 cases of greater omentum combined with flap and/or skin grafts were used to repair the wounds after debridement and cover the main wounds as much as possible. Some cases were filled with muscle flap in deep defect at the same time. The area of tissue flaps ranged from 10 cm?10 cm to 38 cm?22 cm. For particularly large wounds and annular wounds, the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, the paraumbilical flap, the abdominal combined axial flap, and the greater omentum combined with flap and/or skin grafts were used more often. Donor sites of three patients were closed directly, and those of 58 patients were repaired with thin and medium split-thickness skin or mesh skin grafts. The outcome of limb salvage, flap survival, and follow-up of patients in this group were recorded. Results: All the transplanted tissue flaps survived in 61 patients. Fifty-six patients had successful limb salvage, among them, 31 limbs were healed after primary surgery; 20 limbs with flap infection and tissue necrosis survived after debridement and flap sutured in situ; 5 limbs with flap infection, radial artery thrombosis, and hand blood supply crisis survived after debridement and radial artery reconstruction with saphenous vein graft. Five patients had limb salvage failure, among them, 3 patients with wrist electric burns had embolism on the distal end of the transplanted blood vessels, without condition of re-anastomosis, and the hands gradually necrotized; although the upper limb of one patient was salvaged at first, due to the extensive necrosis and infection at the distal radius and ulna and the existence of hand blood supply under flap, considering prognostic function and economic benefits, amputation was required by the patient; although the foot of one patient was salvaged at first, due to the repeated infection, sinus formation, extensive bone necrosis of foot under flap, dullness of sole and dysfunction in walking for a long time, amputation was required by the patient. During the follow-up of 6 months to 5 years, 56 patients had adequate blood supply in the salvaged limbs, satisfied appearance of flaps, and certain recovery of limb function. Conclusions: Timely revascularization, early thorough debridement, and transplantation of large free tissue flap, combined tissue flap, or blood flow-through flap with rich blood supply are the basic factors to get better limb preservation and recovery of certain functions for patients with high voltage electric burns of limbs on the verge of amputation. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Amputation#Burns, Electric#Humans#Limb Salvage#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Treatment Outcome#Wound Healing#Young Adult'
b'Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in the regulation of cell physiological activity and the reconstruction of extracellular environment. Matrix vesicles (MVs) are a type of EVs released by bone-related functional cells, and they participate in the regulation of cell mineralization. Here, we report bioinspired MVs embedded with black phosphorus (BP) and functionalized with cell-specific aptamer (denoted as Apt-bioinspired MVs) for stimulating biomineralization. The aptamer can direct bioinspired MVs to targeted cells, and the increasing concentration of inorganic phosphate originating from BP can facilitate cell biomineralization. The photothermal effect of the Apt-bioinspired MVs can also promote the biomineralization process by stimulating the upregulated expression of heat shock proteins and alkaline phosphatase. In addition, the Apt-bioinspired MVs display outstanding bone regeneration performance. Our strategy provides a method for designing bionic tools to study the mechanisms of biological processes and advance the development of medical engineering. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To evaluate the concordance of PD-L1 expression in various tissues using antibodies 28-8 and SP263 on their respective detection platforms. Methods: Three hundred seventy four specimens of surgical resection of pulmonary diseases in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2017 were collected. Totally 374 cases were tested for PD-L1 expression using the two antibodies, 28-8 and SP263, by respective detection platforms (Dako and Ventana). Finally, 336 cases were used for further evaluation, and the results were statistically analyzed for concordance. Results: For non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the positive rate of PD-L1 was 57.5% (177/308) using SP263, and 57.5% (177/308) using 28-8 antibody. The correlation coefficient was 0.97 (P<0.01). The positive rate of both benign lung diseases and paracancerous tissues was about 10.7% (3/28), and the positive concordance rate was 100.0%. The distribution of both antibodies was also relatively consistent. Conclusions: The expression levels of 28-8 and SP263 antibodies in NSCLC and other tissues are relatively consistent, suggesting both antibodies may be complementary and substitute for each other, which may be useful in guiding clinical management. labels: #Antibodies#B7-H1 Antigen#Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Lung Neoplasms'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of scalp-acupuncture on the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), Interleukin (IL)-1\\xc3\\xa2, zonula occludens-1(ZO-1) mRNA and Occludin mRNA in striatum in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (AICD) rats, so as to investigate its mechanisms underlying improvement of AICD.METHODS: Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly allocated to control, model, IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture groups (n=12 rats in each group). The AICD model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Rats of the IL-1Ra group and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group received intraperitoneal injection of IL-1Ra (0.05 mg\\xc2\\xb7kg-1\\xc2\\xb7d-1), once daily for 6 days. Scalp acupuncture stimulation was applied to bilateral "Dingnieqianxiexian" (MS6) once daily for 6 days for rats in IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group. Before and after intervention, the neurologic deficit score (NDS) was evalua-ted according to Longa\\\'s method. The expression of striatum PTX3 and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA in the striatum tissue were detected by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. The Evans Blue (EB) tracer method was used to monitor the degree of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage.RESULTS: Following modeling, the NDS, EB content and the expression of PTX3 and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 in the striatum tissue were significantly increased, and the ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression was considerably decreased in the model group compared with the control group (P<0.05). After the interventions and compared with the model group, the NDS, EB content in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the striatum ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group were obviously up-regulated (P<0.05), and the expression of IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 was obviously down-regulated in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05) rather than in the IL-1Ra group (P>0.05). The effects of scalp acupuncture combined with IL-1Ra were obviously superior to that of IL-1Ra in down-regulating NDS, EB content and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 expression level, and in up-regulating PTX3, ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression levels (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can improve neurological function and reduce the degree of BBB injury in AICD rats, which may be associated with its function in up-regulating the expression of PTX3 and in promoting the expression of ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#C-Reactive Protein#Cerebrovascular Disorders#Corpus Striatum#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Scalp#Serum Amyloid P-Component'
b'Medical Daily Routine in the Tropics: A Case-Based Overview Abstract. When we speak about \\xc2\\xabmedicine in the tropics\\xc2\\xbb it is malaria epidemics, diarrheal diseases and worm infections that come to mind. A lesser-known fact is the impact of the new epidemic of non-communicable diseases, which are currently responsible for about half of all deaths occurring in the tropical world regions. Changing demographic, social and economic factors are the drivers for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. The observed increase in non-communicable diseases coupled with the persistence of classic infectious tropical diseases creates a double medical burden and presents a great challenge in these low-resource settings. labels: #Communicable Diseases#Diabetes Mellitus#Epidemics#Humans'
b'The marine mollusk Tectus pyramis is a valuable shellfish primarily distributed in the tropical waters of the South China Sea, as well as in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and areas near the southern portion of the Japanese Peninsula. Despite major economic interest in this mollusk, limited genomic resources are available for this species, which has prevented studies of the molecular mechanism, such as biomineralization. Here, we report the first comprehensive transcript dataset of T. pyramis mantle tissue. From a total of 16,801,141 reads, 173,671 unique transcripts were assembled, which provides new genomic resources for the understanding of biomineralization in T. pyramis. The most abundant unique sequences of the top 30 most highly expressed genes were annotated as shematrin, while other highly expressed genes included glycine-rich protein and shematrin-1. Based on transcriptome annotation and Gene Ontology classification, 130 biomineralization-related genes were found including members of the BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), calmodulin, perlucin, and shematrin families, as well as mantle genes, nacrein, and MSI60. The results of qPCR showed that 14 of 24 examined genes were highly expressed in the mantle.

b'CME: Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis Abstract. While tuberculosis mostly manifests as pulmonary infection, a dissemination in any extrapulmonary organ is possible. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mostly affects lymph nodes, pleura and bones. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as an HIV co-infection or immunosuppressive therapies like TNF-alpha-inhibitors have a higher risk of a dissemination of tuberculosis. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is difficult, as microbiological testing mostly requires invasive procedures to obtain a sample for direct proof of tuberculosis by microscopy, culture, molecular methods (e.g. Xpert\\xc2\\xae MTB/RIF) or histology. Treatment follows guidelines of pulmonary tuberculosis with a two-month regimen consisting of four drugs (rifampicin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide and ethambuthol), followed by a four-month therapy with two drugs (rifampicin and isoniazide). Duration of therapy is extended in tuberculous meningitis to one year and in a skeletal dissemination up to six to nine months. Corticosteroids are recommended in cerebral and pericardial tuberculosis. labels: #Antibiotics, Antitubercular#Humans#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Rifampin#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tuberculosis'
b'Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: The clinicopathological data of patients of renal cell carcinoma arising in end-stage renal disease were collected from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (ten cases) and 971 Hospital of PLA Navy (five cases) from January 2009 to August 2018. Results: Among 15 patients, 14 were male and 1 was female, and the age ranged from 38 to 78 years (mean 51 years, median 49 years). All patients had history of chronic renal failure (7-192 months), including 9 patients treated with hemodialysis for 6 to 132 months. In 12 cases the tumor border was distinct and the tumor size ranged from 1.8 to 11.0 cm. Two cases were multifocal and one case showed extensive renal hemorrhage with an inconspicuous tumor mass. Microscopically, 9 cases were clear cell reanl cell carcinoma including one with sarcomatoid differentiation, 4 were acquired cystic kidney disease-associated(ACKD-RCC) and two were papillary renal cell carcinoma. All patients had a follow-up of 3 to 120 months. Four patients died during a follow-up of 6 to 60 months (mean 30 months) as a result of extensive distant metastases (two cases) and renal failure (two cases), while other eleven patients were alive without tumor recurrence or metastasis (median 40.8 months of follow-up ranging from 3 to 120 months). Conclusions: ESRD-RCC is more often seen in younger male patients. The time intervals from the onset of chronic renal failure to the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma differ and tumors are frequently incidental findings. The histological types can be sporadic renal cell carcinoma or unique ACKD-RCC. Tumors are often hemorrhagic and necrotic. Routine physical examination and early detection could benefit ESRD-RCC patients. ESRD-RCC may have a favorable prognosis despite of a large tumor size or the presence of sarcomatoid differentiation. labels: #Adult#Aged#Carcinoma, Renal Cell#Female#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Kidney Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Nephrectomy#Prognosis'
b'The coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi has one of the most global distributions in the modern oceans. They are characteristically covered with calcite scales called coccoliths. In this study, stable strontium immobilization during the calcification process was investigated to indirectly assess a proposed bioremediation approach for removing Sr2+ contamination from marine environments. Results indicate that E. huxleyi has high Sr2+ tolerance and removal efficiency in response to Sr2+ stress ranging from 5.6 to 105.6\\xc2\\xa0ppm. Sr2+ immobilization during E. huxleyi calcification indicates a concentration-dependent synergistic mechanism. At lower concentrations of Sr2+ (25.6\\xc2\\xa0ppm), Sr2+ is incorporated into coccoliths through competitive supply between Sr2+ and Ca2+. In addition, calcite productivity decreases with increased Sr2+ removal efficiency due to crystallographic transformation of coccoliths from hydrated calcite into aragonite at 55.6\\xc2\\xa0ppm Sr2+. Further formation of strontianite at 105.6\\xc2\\xa0ppm Sr2+ is due to precipitation of Sr2+ on the edge of the rims and radial arrays of the coccoliths. Our study implies that coccolithophores are capable of significant removal of Sr2+ from the marine environment. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'The bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii (SP) is known for its ability to cause the phenomenon of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). We explored bacterial participation in the initial stages of the MICP process at the cellular length scale under two different growth environments (a) liquid culture (b) MICP in a soft agar (0.5%) column. In the liquid culture, ex-situ imaging of the cellular environment indicated that S. pasteurii was facilitating nucleation of nanoscale crystals of calcium carbonate on bacterial cell surface and its growth via ureolysis. During the same period, the meso-scale environment (bulk medium) was found to have overgrown calcium carbonate crystals. The effect of media components (urea, CaCl2), presence of live and dead in the growth medium were explored. The agar column method allows for in-situ visualization of the phenomena, and using this platform, we found conclusive evidence of the bacterial cell surface facilitating formation of nanoscale crystals in the microenvironment. Here also the bulk environment or the meso-scale environment was found to possess overgrown calcium carbonate crystals. Extensive elemental analysis using Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), confirmed that the crystals to be calcium carbonate, and two different polymorphs (calcite and vaterite) were identified. Active participation of S. pasteurii cell surface as the site of calcium carbonate precipitation has been shown using EDS elemental mapping with Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). labels: #Biomineralization'
b"OBJECTIVE: To establish SNaPShot-fluorescence capillary analysis (SNaPShot-FCA) assay for rapid detection of the genotype of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2) rs671 locus.METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells. Using R6G-ddATP and cy5-ddGTP as fluorescent substrates, the ALDH2 gene was amplified by SNaPShot to generate DNA products with different fluorescent dyes at the 3' end. FCA was used to detect the products separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered by gel recovery kit, and the genetype of ALDH2 polymorphism was analyzed by fluorescence spectrum. The samples were tested three times repeatedly and compared with the results of DNA sequencing.RESULTS: The optimal concentrations of R6G-ddATP and cy5-ddGTP were 1.4 \\xc3\\xacmol/L and 8.0 \\xc3\\xacmol/L, respectively. 106 samples were tested for ALDH2 genotype by SNaPShot-FCA under optimal conditions, including 67 of wild type (GG), 38 of hybrid type (AG), and 1 of mutant type (AA), which were consistent with the sequencing results.CONCLUSION: This study successfully established the SNaPShot-FCA for the micro-detection of ALDH2 genotype for the rapid screening and identification of ALDH2 gene. labels: #Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial#Fluorescence#Genotype#Humans#Sequence Analysis, DNA"
b'Objective: To explore the screening efficiency of colorectal cancer in urban residents of Kunming, China. Methods: Using the method of cluster sampling, from October 2014 to October 2017, residents of the three jurisdictions of Xishan, Guandu and Chenggong Districts of Kunming city were investigated. The inclusion criteria: (1) resident (for more than 3 years) population of Kunming city aged 40-74 years old; (2) voluntarily participating and receiving colonoscopy; (3) signing informed consent. Based on the Harvard Cancer Risk Index, the questionnaire was built on the consensus of more than 20 years of common cancer epidemiology in China. Through the consensus reached by the multidisciplinary expert panel discussion, a comprehensive evaluation system for cancer risk in China was designed. The high-risk group of colorectal cancer was determined by preliminary screening of the questionnaire, and a free colonoscopy was performed for the appointment to the gastrointestinal endoscopy department of the Yunnan Cancer Hospital. All polypoid lesions and ulcers found by colonoscopy must be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. \\xc3\\xb7(2) test or Fisher exact probability method was used to compare the detection of colorectal cancer in 4 groups of 40-49 years old, 50-59 years old, 60-69 years old, and ?70-years old. Detection of colonoscopy, compliance, pathological examination, pathological diagnosis, and morbidity of colorectal cancer were analyzed. Results: A total of 127 960 people from 40 to 74 years old of urban residents in Kunming city participated in the preliminary screening of the questionnaire, including 59 748 (46.7%) males and 68 212 females (53.3%) with mean age of (53.6\\xc2\\xb18.6) years old. The 40-49 years old group had the largest number of participants (48 044, 37.5%), followed by the groups of 50-59 years old (42 473, 33.2%), 60-69 years old (34 111, 26.7%), and ?70 years old (3332, 2.6%). Till October 2017, a total of 14 971 people were screened as at high risk of colorectal cancer, with the high-risk detection rate of 11.7%, and the high-risk detection rate of women was significantly higher than that of men [13.4% (9 109/68 212) vs. 9.8% (5 862/59 748), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=386.947, P<0.001]. The highest high-risk detection rate was in the 50-59 years group in both gender [men: 11.1% (2202/19 831), women: 15.3% (3034/22 642)]. A total of 3449 people among the high-risk population received colonoscopy examination. The compliance rate of colonoscopy was 23.0% (3449/14 971), and the male compliance rate was 19.8% (1162/5862), which was significantly lower than that of females [25.1% (2287/9109), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=56.175, P<0.001]. The highest compliance was observed in the 50-59 years group [25.4% (1438/5668)], followed by 40-49 years and 60-69 year group [22.1%(1091/4931) and 22.0%(891/4048), respectively], and the compliance of ?70 years old group was the lowest [9.0% (29/324)]. Colonoscopy examination revealed 606 cases with lesions, the detection rate of lesions was 17.6%, and the male detection rate was significantly higher than that of females [26.9% (313/1162) vs. 12.8% (293/2287), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=106.140, P<0.001]. The detection rate of lesions increased with age [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 10.9% (119/1091), 17.5% (252/1438), 25.0% (223/891) and 41.4% (12/29), respectively, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=79.010, P<0.001]. A total of 584 cases underwent endoscopic excision and pathological diagnosis, and 465 cases (13.5%) of precancerous lesions were detected. The prevalence of precancerous lesions in men was higher than that in women [21.3% (247/1162) vs. 9.5% (218/2287), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=90.801, P<0.001], the precancerous lesion detection rate increased with age [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 8.0% (87/1091), 14.3% (206/1438), 18.1% (161/891) and 37.9% (11/29); \\xc3\\xb7(2)=58.109, P<0.001]. A total of 4 patients with colorectal cancer were detected, including 3 males and 1 female. The detection rate of male colorectal cancer was 258.2/100 000, and the female was 43.7/100 000, whose difference was not statistically significant (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=1.488, P=0.223). There was no significant difference in the detection rate of colorectal cancer among 4 age groups [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 91.7/100 000 (1/1091), 69.5/100 000 (1/1438), 224.5/100 000 (2/891) and 0, respectively, P=0.696]. Conclusions: Screening for colorectal cancer is an important measure to control the onset and death of colorectal cancer. Through the questionnaire risk assessment plus colonoscopy, two-step screening method can improve the screening efficiency and greatly reduce the screening cost. labels: #Adult#Aged#China#Colonoscopy#Colorectal Neoplasms#Early Detection of Cancer#Female#Humans#Male#Mass Screening#Middle Aged#Risk Assessment#Urban Population'
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of CT in the differential diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis and fungal ball in paranasal sinus caused by Aspergilus flavus. Methods: In this retrospective study, CT results of 74 cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis including 31 male cases and 43 female cases with age onset from 15 to 74 years old (mean\\xc2\\xb1SD was 50\\xc2\\xb113) and 72 cases of fungal ball in paranasal sinus caused by Aspergilus flavus including 28 male cases and 44 female cases with age onset from 25 to 78 years old (mean\\xc2\\xb1SD was 53\\xc2\\xb115) at Beijing Tongren Hospital confirmed by histopathology were enrolled from January 2013 to May 2017. The CT characteristics of the two groups of cases were compared using \\xc3\\xb7(2) test, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Soft tissue opacification of the involved paranasal sinus was found on CT in each case of the two groups. There were significant differences in the rate of single sinus involvement (44.6% and 90.3% respectively), the incidence of lesion associated with maxillary sinus (91.9% and 70.8% respectively), ethmoid sinus (41.9% and 2.8% respectively), frontal sinus (29.7% and 0 respectively), calcification (50.0% and 72.2% respectively), and the enlargement of maxillary sinus opening (13.2% and 35.3% respectively), in addition to the central calcification (83.8% and 59.6% respectively) between the two groups (all P<0.05). However, the incidence of sphenoid sinus involvement (32.4% and 34.7% respectively), bone sclerosis (56.8% and 62.5% respectively) or destruction(18.9% and 16.7% respectively) were not found different between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Though the CT findings are similar between the two diseases such as soft tissue opacification of the involved paranasal sinus with calcification and bone sclerosis or destruction, there are still a few characteristics on CT in differentiating the one from the other. The involvement of multi-sinuses, maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus and frontal sinus, the central calcification are more common in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis. However, the CT features including single sinus involvement, calcification and enlargement of maxillary sinus opening, can be seen more often in the fungal ball in paranasal sinus caused by Aspergilus flavus. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Diagnosis, Differential#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Paranasal Sinuses#Pseudomonas Infections#Pseudomonas aeruginosa#Retrospective Studies#Sinusitis#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Young Adult'
b'There has been significant progress in the self-assembly of biological materials, but the one-step covalent peptide self-assembly for well-defined nanostructures is still in its infancy. Inspired by the biological functions of tyrosine, a covalently assembled fluorescent peptide nanogel is developed by a ruthenium-mediated, one-step photo-crosslinking of tyrosine-rich short peptides under the visible light within 6 minutes. The covalently assembled peptide nanogel is stable in various organic solvents and different pH levels, unlike those made from vulnerable non-covalent assemblies. The semipermeable peptide nanogel with a high density of redox-active tyrosine acts as a novel nano-bioreactor, allowing the formation of uniform metal-peptide hybrids by selective biomineralization under UV irradiation. As such, this peptide nanogel could be useful in the design of novel nanohybrids and peptidosomes possessing functional nanomaterials. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'In bivalves, the mantle tissue secretes organic matrix and inorganic ions into the extrapallial space (EPS) to form the shells. In addition, more and more evidences indicate the participation of hemocytes in shell mineralization, but no direct evidence has been reported that verifies the presence of hemocytes in the EPS, and their exact roles in biomineralization remain uncertain. Here, we identified hemocytes from the EPS of Pinctada fucata. Numerous components involved in cellular and humoral immunity were identified by proteome analysis, together with several proteins involved in calcium metabolism. The hemocytes exerted active phagocytosis and significantly upregulated the expression of immune genes after immune stimulation. A group of granulocytes were found to contain numerous calcium-rich vesicles and crystals, which serve as a calcium pool. During shell regeneration, some genes involved in calcium metabolism are upregulated. Strikingly, most of the shell matrix proteins were absent in the hemocytes, suggesting that they might not be solely responsible for directing the growth of the shell. Taken together, our results provided comprehensive information about the function of hemocytes in immunity and shell formation. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To investigate the expression of fragile-site associated tumor suppressor (FATS) in non-small cell lung cancer and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Methods: A total of 140 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 30 adjacent normal tissues were used to detect the expression level of FATS protein, and to analyze the relationship of FATS protein expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of NSCLC. Results: Western blot showed that the expression of FATS in adjacent normal tissues was significantly higher than that in non-small cell lung cancer tissues. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the high expression rate of FATS in 140 cases of NSCLC was 40.0%, and the high expression rate of FATS in 30 cases of adjacent tissues was 73.3%. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.01). Further analysis showed that the TNM stage (P=0.044) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.022) were significant difference between FATS high expression group and low expression group. The 6-year overall survival (OS) rates of NSCLC patients with FATS high-expression and low-expression were 57.1% and 23.8%, respectively, and the 6-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 53.6% and 21.4%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P=0.001). In Cox multivariate analysis, we found gender (HR=1.658, P=0.028; HR=1.684, P=0.023), TNM staging (HR=2.327, P=0.019; HR=2.332, P=0.013) and FATS expression (HR=0.532, P=0.010; HR=0.538, P=0.009) were independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS of NSCLC patients. Conclusions: The expression of FATS protein is associated with the development and is an independent prognostic factor of NSCLC patients. The detection of FATS protein is expected to be a new biomarker for evaluating the prognosis of NSCLC patients. labels: #Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Cytoskeletal Proteins#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Lung Neoplasms#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis'
b'OBJECTIVES: Access to dental healthcare services is a major determinant of dental health in communities. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the global prevalence of dental needs and of unmet dental needs in adolescents.METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched in June 2018. The summary measures included the prevalence of met and unmet dental needs. A meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method to obtain pooled summary measures. Out of 41,661 retrieved articles, 57 were ultimately included.RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of orthodontic treatment needs was 46.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 53.0), that of general treatment needs was 59.0% (95% CI, 42.0 to 75.0), that of periodontal treatment needs was 71.0% (95% CI, 46.0 to 96.0), and that of malocclusion treatment needs was 39.0% (95% CI, 28.0 to 50.0). The pooled prevalence of unmet dental needs was 34.0% (95% CI, 27.0 to 40.0).CONCLUSIONS: The highest and lowest prevalence of unmet dental needs were found in Southeast Asia and Europe, respectively. The prevalence of dental needs was higher in the countries of the Americas and Europe than in other World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The prevalence of unmet dental needs was higher in Southeast Asia and Africa than in other WHO regions. labels: #Adolescent#Dental Care#Global Health#Health Services Needs and Demand#Humans#Prevalence'
b'OBJECTIVE: To assess biventricular, especially right ventricular, function and deformationin rhesus monkeys with spontaneous type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).METHODS: Twelve male spontaneous T2DM rhesus monkeys and age, sex, body mass matched 9 healthy rhesus monkeys without hypertension and myocardial infarction were included in this study. Fasting blood glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood liquid levels were measured. Biventricular function and myocardial deformations were evaluated by CMR cine and tissue-tracking.RESULTS: Compared with control, the FPG and HbA1c levers were significantly increased in T2DM group, but there was no significant difference in body mass and age between the two groups. CMR result showed that there was no significant decrease in right ventricle and left ventricle ejection fraction in T2DM (P < 0.05). However, the absolute value of radial and circumferential global peak systolic strain, systolic strain rate and three directions global peak diastolic strain rate of the right ventricle free wall were lower in the T2DM group (P < 0.05). Also, only radial and circumferential peak systolic strain and radial diastolic strain rate of left ventricle were higher (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricle showed systolic and diastolic dysfunction which were consistent with left ventricle in T2DM by CMR-tissue tracking. labels: #Animals#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Heart Ventricles#Macaca mulatta#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Reproducibility of Results#Stroke Volume#Ventricular Dysfunction, Right'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and related proteins of inflammation and anti-oxidative stress in spinal cord in mice with spinal cord injury (SCI), so as to explore its mechanisms underlying function repair.METHODS: Thirty-six female C57BL/6 mice were equally randomized into 3 groups: sham operation, model and EA. The SCI model was established by clamping the spinal cord for 25 s with a serrefine after laminectomy of the 1st lumbar vertebra (L1). EA (1.5 Hz/7.5 Hz, 1.0 mA) was applied to bila-teral "Zusanli" (ST36) and "Sanyinjiao" (SP6) for 10 min, once a day for 7 days. The hindlimb locomotor function was assessed according to the state of the range of motion, coordination, claw gesture of the hind leg ankle-joint, trunk stabi-lity and the tail posture by using Basso Mouse Scale(BMS). The histopathological changes of the injured area of the spinal cord were determined by H.E. staining. The expression levels of ApoE, phosphorylated nuclear transcription factor-\\xc3\\xaaB(p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB), interleukin 1 beta(IL-1\\xc3\\xa2), phosphorylated extracellular regulatory protein kinase(p-ERK1/2), extracellular regulatory protein kinase(ERK1/2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) and heme oxidase-1(HO-1) in the spinal cord were detected by Western blot, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were displayed by immunofluorescence staining.RESULTS: After modeling, the BMS scores were significantly decreased in the model group compared with the sham operation group (P<0.05). Following EA, the BMS scores were markedly increased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05), suggesting an improvement of the hindlimb locomotor function. H.E. stain showed structural disorder with lots of cavities, severe inflammatory infiltration with large quantity of inflammatory cells, and apparent reduction of normal neurons in the injured spinal cord tissue of model group, which was milder in the EA group. The expression levels of ApoE, p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB, IL-1\\xc3\\xa2, p-ERK1/2 (not ERK1/2), Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly increased in the model group than those in the sham operation group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression levels of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, Nrf2 and HO-1 were further notably up-regulated (P<0.05), and those of p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 proteins obviously down-regulated in the EA group (P<0.05). Immunoflorescence staining showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells was apparently increased in the model group compared with the sham operation group and observably decreased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: EA can significantly improve locomotor function in SCI mice, which is associated with its effects in reducing inflammation, oxi-dative stress reactions and reactive astrocyte proliferation via up-regulating expression of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, and Nrf2/HO-1 (antioxidant pathway) and inhibiting IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 and NF-\\xc3\\xaaB expression. labels: #Animals#Electroacupuncture#Female#Heat-Shock Proteins#Inflammation#Locomotion#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Oxidative Stress#Spinal Cord#Spinal Cord Injuries'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis of HL60 cells induced by oncolytic virus Reovirus type 3 (Reo3).METHODS: HL60 cells were infected with Reo3 at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) with the uninfected HL60 cells as control group. After 48 h of infection, the activity of HL60 cells infected with virus at different MOI was detected by CCK8 method to investigate the influence of MOI to cell activity. Simultaneously, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells was detected by flow cytometry, and the activation level of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the expression of apoptotic-related protein in HL60 cells were detected by Western blot. Before infection with Reo3 for 48 h, HL60 cells were treated with 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a specific inhibitor of PKR, for 24 h. Afterward, the apoptotic level and expression of apoptotic related proteins were detected.RESULTS: Activity of HL60 cells was obviously inhibited after infected with Reo3 with a MOI of 1 for 48 h. The cell survival rate was (24.333\\xc2\\xb13.396)% and the apoptotic rate was (29.96\\xc2\\xb12.06)%. Both rates were all higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Western blot results showed that the expression levels of PKR, p-PKR, Bax, Caspase3 and cleaved Caspase3 in HL60 cells infected with Reo3 were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), while the expression level of Bcl-2 was lower (P < 0.05). Compared with the group without inhibitor, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells pretreated with 2-AP decreased (P < 0.05), the phosphorylation level of PKR and the expression level of apoptotic-related protein also decreased (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Oncolytic virus Reo3 could activate PKR in HL60 cells and thus induce apoptosis of HL60 cells. labels: #2-Aminopurine#Apoptosis#Caspase 3#Flow Cytometry#HL-60 Cells#Humans#Mammalian orthoreovirus 3#Oncolytic Viruses#Phosphorylation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2#bcl-2-Associated X Protein#eIF-2 Kinase'
b'Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and diagnostic strategies of early hydatidiform mole. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 526 women with hydatidiform mole who underwent suction curettage and were confirmed by histopathology in Dalian Maternal and ChildHealth Care Hospital from Feb. 2013 to Feb. 2018, including 484 women with gestational age less than or equal to 12 weeks (the early group) and 42 women with gestational age greater than 12 weeks (the late group). The clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and the pathological diagnosis and pre-evacuation ultrasound examination of the early group were further discussed. Results: Compared with the late group, the clinical characteristics of the early group tended to be atypical, and the incidence of vaginal bleeding, excessive uterine size, theca lutein cysts (>6 cm) and pregnancy complications decreased significantly (all P<0.05). The serum level of \\xc3\\xa2-hCG in the early group was significantly lower than that in the late group (Z=-2.382, P=0.017). While there was no significant difference in the pre-evacuation ultrasound detection rate between the two groups (53.5% vs 66.7%; \\xc3\\xb7(2)=2.697, P=0.101). Five hundred and fifteen patients completed the follow-up, and 38 patients with post-mole neoplasia were all cured. There was no significant difference in the malignant transformation rate of hydatidiform mole between the two groups (7.0% vs 11.9%; \\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.745, P=0.388). In the early group, 302 cases of complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), 179 cases of partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) and 3 cases of unclassified hydatidiform mole (UHM) were histologically diagnosed, according to pathological morphology combined with p57(KIP2) immunohistochemical staining. Compared with pathological diagnosis, the overall pre-evacuation ultrasound detection rate in the early hydatidiform mole was 53.5% (259/484), which was significantly better for complete (78.1%, 236/302) versus partial (11.7%, 21/179) hydatidiform moles (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=199.224, P<0.01). There was significantly weak negative correlation between the overall ultrasound detection rate and gestational age of hydatidiform mole (r=-0.211, P<0.01). The gestational age of early PHM was significantly longer than that of CHM (68.0 vs 58.5 days; Z=-8.048, P<0.01). Conclusions: The clinical presentations of early hydatidiform mole are not typical. Although ultrasound examination identifies only about half of hydatidiform moles, ultrasonography is still an important auxiliary examination method. Morphological examination combined with p57(K)IP2 immunohistochemical staining could effectively diagnose early hydatidiform mole, so as to reduce the missed diagnosis of hydatidiform mole. labels: #China#Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human#Female#Gestational Age#Humans#Hydatidiform Mole#Incidence#Pregnancy#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome#Ultrasonography#Uterine Hemorrhage#Uterine Neoplasms#Vacuum Curettage'
b'Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the causative bacterium of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. This bacterium secretes protein toxins whose genes are encoded in an auto-transmissible plasmid called pVA1. The presence of this plasmid in V. parahaemolyticus is determinant for disease development. Its propagation is not only linked to bacterial colonisation capacity but also to horizontal gene transfer mechanisms. Nevertheless, the active uptake of plasmid, which is known as natural genetic transformation (NGT), has not yet been proposed as a possible acquisition mechanism of the pVA1 plasmid among Vibrio species. Previous studies suggest that some Vibrio species have the ability to undergo NGT in the presence of chitin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the induction of NGT mediated by chitin in V. parahaemolyticus (ATCC-17802) through its ability to incorporate and express the pVA1 plasmid. The results showed that a reference strain that does not initially contain the plasmid can incorporate the plasmid under the appropriate transformation conditions, and cause mortality in white shrimp similar to that observed for pathogenic strains isolated from infectious outbreaks. Given the management and conditions of a shrimp farm with large amounts of chitinous exoskeletons, it is feasible that NGT could be a possible acquisition mechanism of plasmid pVA1 among Vibrio species, turning a non-causative strain of V. parahaemolyticus into a causative strain. With this study, we have expanded the knowledge of the pathogenesis process mediated by NGT and the understanding of the possible propagation mechanisms of emerging diseases in the aquaculture sector. labels: #Animals#Aquaculture#Penaeidae#Plasmids#Transformation, Genetic#Vibrio parahaemolyticus'
b'Endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare entity in the pediatric population. Patients usually present with height deceleration and continuous weight gain, along with other classic stigmata of CS, such as acne, striae, hirsutism and others. The diagnosis of CS involves documentation of abnormal cortisol secretion with measurement of urinary free cortisol and midnight serum or salivary cortisol, and the use of the 1mg dexamethasone suppression test. After confirmation of CS, localization of the source of hypercortisolemia, involves differentiation of ACTH-dependent versus ACTH-independent causes of CS. Surgical resection of the identified source of CS is the preferred method of treatment whenever possible. labels: #Child#Cushing Syndrome#Humans#Hydrocortisone'
b'Decomposing fungi translocate manganese (Mn) as demonstrated by the fact that Mn has been found to accumulate on decomposing leaves associated with individual fungal hyphae forming insoluble Mn(III,IV) oxides that remain concentrated in diffuse patches. Here, we studied Mn translocation and precipitation by the saprophytic fungus Alternaria sp. strain FBL507 both on naturally decomposing oak leaves and in vitro experiments. Manganese was translocated and precipitated in beads and encrustations along the fungal hyphae. The combination of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy chemical data showed that the precipitates found on leaves were rhodochrosite (MnCO3), birnessite ([Na, Ca, K]Mn2O4? 1.5H2O) and possibly Mn oxalate. The precipitates on wood were an amorphous Mn-O compound, probably MnO. Thus, Mn oxidation state in the precipitates spanned from +2 to +4, with +3 and +4 only in the birnessite on the leaves. In vitro experiments showed that Mn precipitates formed in living hyphae, suggesting the possibility that Mn precipitation is actively produced by the fungus. Such a possibility raises interesting questions regarding the role of readily available Mn in the activity of saprophytic fungi and other soil microorganisms, such as would result in a large involvement of Mn in the cycles of the major nutrient elements. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative seizures under general anesthesia are rare and our observation is the first to demonstrate a distinct electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern on the Narcotrend monitor.PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a 30-year-old man undergoing craniotomy for glioblastoma resection under general anesthesia who suffered tonic-clonic seizures captured in a specific pattern by the intraoperative EEG.DIAGNOSES: Our depth of anesthesia monitor recorded, before the seizure, a widening of the beta-wave performance in a distinct "triangular-shaped" pattern. This pattern was repeated before the second seizure. The patient had no previous history of seizures and following surgery no further seizures were recorded.INTERVENTIONS: A spectrogram analysis showed a distinct increase in mean absolute beta power immediately prior to the first seizure. The EEG immediately prior to the second seizure was characterized by broadband noise. Both seizures were characterized by increased mean absolute delta, theta, and beta power.OUTCOMES: The increase in EEG beta activity seen before the tonic-clonic movements may represent cortical irritability secondary to surgical manipulation, induced by electrical stimulation, reflecting progressive brain over-arousal. The attentive analysis of the relative beta power may have helped forecast the occurrence of the second seizure.LESSONS: We report the use of a simple, inexpensive, and portable EEG-based monitoring device to assist seizure detection and decision making. labels: #Adult#Anesthesia, General#Electroencephalography#Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic#Humans#Intraoperative Complications#Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring#Male'
b'Objective: The development of these guidelines is sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres with published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Methods: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines for guidelines protocols. Results: The Executive Summary of this 2019 updated guideline contains 58 numbered recommendations: 12 are Grade A (21%), 19 are Grade B (33%), 21 are Grade C (36%), and 6 are Grade D (10%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the subsequent Appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update contains 357 citations of which 51 (14%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (strong), 168 (47%) are EL 2 (intermediate), 61 (17%) are EL 3 (weak), and 77 (22%) are EL 4 (no clinical evidence). Conclusion: This CPG is a practical tool that practicing endocrinologists and regulatory bodies can refer to regarding the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult-care services with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). It provides guidelines on assessment, screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment recommendations for a range of individuals with various causes of adult GHD. The recommendations emphasize the importance of considering testing patients with a reasonable level of clinical suspicion of GHD using appropriate growth hormone (GH) cut-points for various GH-stimulation tests to accurately diagnose adult GHD, and to exercise caution interpreting serum GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, as various GH and IGF-1 assays are used to support treatment decisions. The intention to treat often requires sound clinical judgment and careful assessment of the benefits and risks specific to each individual patient. Unapproved uses of GH, long-term safety, and the current status of long-acting GH preparations are also discussed in this document. LAY ABSTRACT This updated guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the identification, screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for a range of individuals with various causes of adult growth-hormone deficiency (GHD) and patients with childhood-onset GHD transitioning to adult care. The update summarizes the most current knowledge about the accuracy of available GH-stimulation tests, safety of recombinant human GH (rhGH) replacement, unapproved uses of rhGH related to sports and aging, and new developments such as long-acting GH preparations that use a variety of technologies to prolong GH action. Recommendations offer a framework for physicians to manage patients with GHD effectively during transition to adult care and adulthood. Establishing a correct diagnosis is essential before consideration of replacement therapy with rhGH. Since the diagnosis of GHD in adults can be challenging, GH-stimulation tests are recommended based on individual patient circumstances and use of appropriate GH cut-points. Available GH-stimulation tests are discussed regarding variability, accuracy, reproducibility, safety, and contraindications, among other factors. The regimen for starting and maintaining rhGH treatment now uses individualized dose adjustments, which has improved effectiveness and reduced reported side effects, dependent on age, gender, body mass index, and various other individual characteristics. With careful dosing of rhGH replacement, many features of adult GHD are reversible and side effects of therapy can be minimized. Scientific studies have consistently shown rhGH therapy to be beneficial for adults with GHD, including improvements in body composition and quality of life, and have demonstrated the safety of short- and long-term rhGH replacement.

b'PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Stinging hairs are striking examples of plant microengineering-the plant equivalent of the hypodermic syringe. The requisite mechanical properties are mostly achieved by cell wall mineralization. Stinging hairs of Urtica dioica (Urticaceae) are known to be mineralized with silica and calcium carbonate and those of Loasaceae also with calcium phosphate, but no comparative study has been provided across different taxa with stinging hairs.METHODS: Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with cryo-SEM and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were used to analyze morphology and biomineralization of stinging hairs of 43 species from the families Caricaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Loasaceae, Namaceae, and Urticaceae.KEY RESULTS: Stinging hair morphology is similar across the taxa studied, in striking contrast to the divergent patterns of biomineralization. Trichome bases are mostly calcified, sometimes silicified, the shafts are mostly calcified, and the apices silicified (Urticaceae), and contain calcium phosphate (Caricaceae, Namaceae), both silica and calcium phosphate (some Loasaceae), or no minerals (Cnidoscolus, Euphorbiaceae). Some stinging hairs are superficially thinly coated with silica over a cell wall otherwise mineralized with calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate.CONCLUSIONS: Mineralization patterns are surprisingly diverse and involve three different biominerals deposited in different parts of individual trichomes with calcium phosphate a common component. The physical properties of different wall regions of the stinging trichomes are thus fine-tuned to optimize their function via modulation of wall thickness and differential element deposition. Similar function is apparently achieved through divergent wall compositions. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'RATIONALE: One-and-a-half syndrome (OAAH) is characterized as the combination of ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. OAAH syndrome accompanied with 7th and 8th cranial nerve palsy is called 16-and-a-half syndrome. We aimed to report the case of 16-and-a-half syndrome with metastatic pons tumor.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old male diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis occurring 15 months ago was referred to our clinic with the chief complaint of horizontal diplopia and right gaze palsy.DIAGNOSIS: According to the patient symptom, ocular examination, and radiographic findings, he was diagnosed as 16-and-a-half syndrome which was caused by brain tumor metastasis from NSCLC.INTERVENTIONS: We referred him to hemato-oncology department and he was treated with radiation and supportive therapy.OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the patient passed away 1 month later without improvement of ophthalmoplegia.LESSONS: The clinical findings of our case indicate 16-and-a-half syndrome caused by brain tumor metastasis from NSCLC, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. The case highlights a rare cause of OAAH spectrum disease and the importance of a systemic work-up including associated neurologic symptoms and brain imaging in patients with horizontal gaze palsy. labels: #Brain Neoplasms#Facial Nerve Diseases#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Ocular Motility Disorders#Ophthalmoplegia#Pons#Syndrome#Vestibulocochlear Nerve Diseases'
b'The aim of this research is to investigate the application value of TTE in the diagnosis of the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA).The echocardiographic findings of 11 patients with ALCAPA confirmed by surgery in our hospital from October 2007 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) diagnosis and intraoperative diagnosis.Surgery was performed in all of the patients to establish the dual coronary artery system. Four underwent the Takeuchi procedure and 7 had re-implantation of the anomalous left coronary artery. The CTA diagnoses of the 11 patients were consistent with the surgical diagnoses, and the diagnostic accuracy was 100% (11/11). Echocardiographic diagnosis showed consistent results in 10 cases, while one case was misdiagnosed as endocardial fibroelastosis; the diagnostic accuracy was 90.9% (10/11). The echocardiographic features of these patients with ALCAPA included: abnormal left coronary ostium arising from the pulmonary trunk with retrograde coronary artery flow in 10 patients; enlargement of the right coronary artery in 8 patients; abundant intercoronary septal collaterals in 6 patients; and moderate and significant mitral regurgitation in 7 patients. Echocardiography showed that the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter before surgery were significantly different from those after surgery (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05) and that the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening before surgery were not significantly different from those after surgery (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05).Transthoracic echocardiography can diagnose ALCAPA in a timely, accurate, and noninvasive manner, and it could be of great significance in guiding clinical operations and in predicting prognosis. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bland White Garland Syndrome#Child#Child, Preschool#Echocardiography#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'Although controlled local inflammation is essential for adequate bone regeneration, several studies have shown that hyper-inflammatory conditions after major trauma are associated with impaired fracture healing. These hyper-inflammatory conditions include the trauma-induced systemic inflammatory response to major injury, open fractures, and significant injury to the surrounding soft tissues. The current literature suggests that increased or prolonged influx of neutrophils into the fracture hematoma may mediate impairment of bone regeneration after hyper-inflammatory conditions. The underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesize that high neutrophil numbers inhibit synthesis of mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). We therefore studied the effect of increasing concentrations of neutrophils on ECM synthesis by human BMSCs in vitro. Moreover, we determined how high neutrophil concentrations affect BMSC cell counts, as well as BMSC osteogenic activity determined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and ALP activity. Co-culture of BMSCs with neutrophils induced a 52% decrease in BMSC cell count (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.01), a 64% decrease in the percentage of ALP+ cells (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.001), a 28% decrease in total ALP activity (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.01), and a significant decrease in the amount of mineralized ECM [38% decrease after 4\\xe2\\x80\\x89weeks (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.05)]. Co-cultures with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils within transwells did not induce a significant decrease in ALP activity. In conclusion, our data shows that a decreased amount of mineralized ECM became synthesized by BMSCs, when they were co-cultured with high neutrophil concentrations. Moreover, high neutrophil concentrations induced a decrease in BMSC cell counts and decreased ALP activity. Clarifying the underlying mechanism may contribute to development of therapies that augment bone regeneration or prevent impaired fracture healing after hyper-inflammatory conditions. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Avian eggshells are composed of several layers made of organic compounds and a mineral phase (calcite), and the general structure is basically the same in all species. A comparison of the structure, crystallography, and chemical composition shows that despite an overall similarity, each species has its own structure, crystallinity, and composition. Eggshells are a perfect example of the crystallographic versus biological concept of the formation and growth mechanisms of calcareous biominerals: the spherulitic-columnar structure is described as "a typical case of competitive crystal growth", but it is also said that the eggshell matrix components regulate eggshell mineralization. Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analyses show that the crystallinity differs between different species. Nevertheless, the three layers are composed of rounded granules, and neither facets nor angles are visible. In-situ analyses show the heterogeneous distribution of chemical elements throughout the thickness of single eggshell. The presence of organic matrices other than the outer and inner membranes in eggshells is confirmed by thermograms and infrared spectrometry, and the differences in quality and quantity depend on the species. Thus, as in other biocrystals, crystal growth competition is not enough to explain these differences, and there is a strong biological control of the eggshell secretion. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To assess the technical success rate, stent patency, clinical efficacy and complications of stent placement for filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out for 12 patients with filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava associated with severe post-thrombotic syndrome, who underwent stent placement after ineffective conservative therapy at Nanjing First Hospital from March 2016 to December 2018,9 males and 3 females, aged from 48 to 77 years, mean age 60 years, six had bilateral lower extremity symptoms and six had unilateral lower extremity symptoms.Technical success rate, stent patency, clinical efficacy and complications of stent placement were recorded. Clinical success was defined as relief of symptoms and a decrease in clinical, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology (CEAP) score for at least grade 1. Results: Stent placement in the unilateral or bilateral iliocaval occlusion was successful in 11 patients. The cause of technical failure in the single patient with failed stent placement was an inability to cross the occluded left iliacvein and the patient was treated with stent placement in the right iliocaval vein.There were 7 patients with inferior vena cava and unilateral iliocaval stent placement; 5 patients with inferior vena cava and bilateral iliocaval stent placement. Acute stent thrombosis occlusion occurred in 1 case after the operation, the blood flow recanalized after catheter-directed thrombolysis and re-stenting. All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months, with an average of (13\\xc2\\xb16) months. During the follow-up period, CTV or venography of lower limbs showed that the blood flow in the stent was unobstructed. At the last follow-up, 12 patients were evaluated as clinically effective. Three patients had transient treatment of lateral lumbar pain during operation, which alleviated by themselves.No significant abdominal pain, severe hemorrhage, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and other complications related to treatment occurred in all patients during perioperative period and follow-up. Conclusion: Stent placement is safe and feasible in the treatment of filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava, which can alleviate the clinical symptoms of severe post-thrombotic syndrome. labels: #Aged#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Stents#Treatment Outcome#Vascular Patency#Vena Cava Filters#Vena Cava, Inferior#Venous Thrombosis'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of moxibustion pretreatment at different time on serum hormone levels in diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) rats, so as to explore its protective mechanisms.METHODS: Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, moxibustion-1 (moxibustion was given 4 weeks before modeling), moxibustion-2 (moxibustion was given 2 weeks before modeling and 2 weeks from the 1st day on after modeling ) and moxibustion-3 (moxibustion was given 4 weeks from the 1st day on after modeling) groups (n=8 rats in each group). The DOR model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides (75 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. Grain-moxibustion was applied to "Shenshu" (BL23) and "Guanyuan" (CV4) for 7 cones, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The body weight and the ovary weight were recorded for calculating the ovarian index. The levels of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), androgen (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were detected by ELISA.RESULTS: After modeling, ovarian index and serum AMH levels were obviously decreased (P<0.05), and the levels of serum FSH, E2, T and DHEA were significantly increased in contrast with the control group (P<0.05). Following intervention and compared with the model group, the serum FSH and DHEA levels of each moxibustion group were significantly reduced (P<0.05), the AMH levels significantly increased and E2 and T contents significantly decreased in the moxibustion-2 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05). The serum FSH, E2 and T contents in moxibustion-2 group were obviously lower than those of the moxibustion-1 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Moxibustion pre-treatment can improve ovarian reserve function in DOR rats, while the effect is different with different intervention time, and the best intervention time is pre-occurrence and early stage of DOR. labels: #Animals#Female#Follicle Stimulating Hormone#Moxibustion#Ovarian Reserve#Ovary#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Nonreductive biomineralization of uranium is a promising methodology for the removal of uranium contamination as it provides stable products and wide applications. However, the efficiency of mineralization has become a major obstacle for the removal of uranium contamination by this technology, and the mineralizing process still remains largely obscure. To solve this problem in a practical way, we report a fast nonreductive biomineralization process of uranium by Bacillus subtilis ATCC-6633, a widespread bacterium with environmentally-friendly applications. In this system, we demonstrated that the size and crystallization degree of the obtained nonreduced biomineralized products is significantly superior to the results reported in the literature under comparable conditions. Meanwhile, combined with SEM, TEM, and FT-IR, a mineralization process of uranium transfer from the outer surface of the Bacillus subtilis ATCC-6633 to the internal has been clearly observed, which was accompanied by the evolution of amorphous U(VI) to crystalline uramphite. This work uncovers whole-process insights into the nonreductive biomineralization of uranium by Bacillus subtilis ATCC-6633, paving a new way for the rapid and sustained removal of uranium contamination. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Background and Aims: Boraginales are often characterized by a dense cover of stiff, mineralized trichomes, which may act as a first line of defence against herbivores. Recent studies have demonstrated that the widely reported silica and calcium carbonate in plant trichomes may be replaced by calcium phosphate. The present study investigates mineralization patterns in 42 species from nine families of the order Boraginales to investigate detailed patterns of mineralization and the possible presence of a phylogenetic signal in different mineralization patterns.Methods: The distribution of biominerals was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) including cryo-SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses with element mapping. The observed distribution of biominerals was plotted onto a published phylogeny of the Boraginales. Three colours were selected to represent the principal elements: Si (red), Ca (green) and P (blue).Key Results: Calcium carbonate was present in the mineralized trichomes of all 42 species investigated, silica in 30 and calcium phosphate in 25; multiple mineralization with calcium carbonate and silica or calcium phosphate was found in all species, and 13 of the species were mineralized with all three biominerals. Trichome tips featured the most regular pattern - nearly all were exclusively mineralized with either silica or calcium phosphate. Biomineralization of the trichome shafts and bases was found to be more variable between species. However, the trichome bases were also frequently mineralized with calcium phosphate or silica, indicating that not only the tip is under functional constraints requiring specific patterns of chemical heterogeneity. The complete absence of either silica or phosphate may be an additional feature with systematic relevance.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that complex, site-specific and differential biomineralization is widespread across the order Boraginales. Calcium phosphate, only recently first reported as a structural plant biomineral, is common and appears to be functionally analogous to silica. A comparison with the phylogeny of Boraginales additionally reveals striking phylogenetic patterns. Most families show characteristic patterns of biomineralization, such as the virtual absence of calcium phosphate in Cordiaceae and Boraginaceae, the triple biomineralization of Heliotropiaceae and Ehretiaceae, or the absence of silica in Namaceae and Codonaceae. The complex chemical and phylogenetic patterns indicate that trichome evolution and functionalities are anything but simple and follow complex functional and phylogenetic constraints. labels: #Biomineralization'

b'Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the role of extended involved-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with early stage extranodal nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) in a single center, and to explore the long-term effect of risk-adaptive therapy. Methods: Among 238 patients with early stage NKTCL, there were 191 in high-risk group [any risk factor of age > 60, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score?2, primary tumor invasion, or Ann Arbor stage ?] and 47 in low-risk group (no risk factor). A total of 204 patients received radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, 15 received radiotherapy alone and 19 received chemotherapy alone. One-hundred and eighty-six patients had radiotherapy at a dose ?50 Gy and 159 patients received chemotherapy with asparaginase-based regimen. Results: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and progression- free survival (PFS)rate of all patients were 66.2% and 57.5%. Five-year OS and PFS rates in low-risk group were 91.8% and 88.0%, while 59.3% and 49.3% in high-risk group. The survival of patients in low-risk group were better than those in high-risk group (both P<0.001). The five-year OS rate in combined therapy group, radiotherapy group and chemotherapy group were 71.7%, 52.3% and 20.7%, respectively (P<0.001). The five-year PFS rate were 63.5%, 23.3% and 24.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Among 219 patients receiving radiotherapy, the 5-year OS and PFS rate of patients with primary site radiotherapy dose ? 50 Gy were 72.6% and 66.1%, higher than those of patients with a dose <50 Gy (57.3% and 30.9%, respectively; P=0.031, P<0.001). In the high-risk group, the 5-year OS and PFS rate of the patients who received radiotherapy combined with more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy were 66.5% and 62.6%, higher than those of patients received less than 4 cycles of chemotherapy (56.7% and 46.4%, P=0.045 and 0.020, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that ECOG score (HR=2.208, P=0.001), primary site (HR=4.887, P<0.001), primary tumor invasion (HR=3.265, P=0.001) and radiation dose (HR=1.895, P=0.011) were independent factors of OS in early NKTCL patients. Conclusion: Extended-involved field IMRT with radiation dose more than 50 Gy was the main treatment for patients with early stage NKTCL. Radiotherapy combined with adequate cycle chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis of high-risk patients. labels: #Combined Modality Therapy#Disease-Free Survival#Drug Therapy#Humans#Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated#Risk Factors#Survival Rate'
b"Although geographical patterns of species' sensitivity to environmental changes are defined by interacting multiple stressors, little is known about compensatory processes shaping regional differences in organismal vulnerability. Here, we examine large-scale spatial variations in biomineralization under heterogeneous environmental gradients of temperature, salinity and food availability across a 30\\xc2\\xb0 latitudinal range (3,334\\xc2\\xa0km), to test whether plasticity in calcareous shell production and composition, from juveniles to large adults, mediates geographical patterns of resilience to climate change in critical foundation species, the mussels Mytilus edulis and M.\\xc2\\xa0trossulus. We find shell calcification decreased towards high latitude, with mussels producing thinner shells with a higher organic content in polar than temperate regions. Salinity was the best predictor of within-region differences in mussel shell deposition, mineral and organic composition. In polar, subpolar, and Baltic low-salinity environments, mussels produced thin shells with a thicker external organic layer (periostracum), and an increased proportion of calcite (prismatic layer, as opposed to aragonite) and organic matrix, providing potentially higher resistance against dissolution in more corrosive waters. Conversely, in temperate, higher salinity regimes, thicker, more calcified shells with a higher aragonite (nacreous layer) proportion were deposited, which suggests enhanced protection under increased predation pressure. Interacting effects of salinity and food availability on mussel shell composition predict the deposition of a thicker periostracum and organic-enriched prismatic layer under forecasted future environmental conditions, suggesting a capacity for increased protection of high-latitude populations from ocean acidification. These findings support biomineralization plasticity as a potentially advantageous compensatory mechanism conferring Mytilus species a protective capacity for quantitative and qualitative trade-offs in shell deposition as a response to regional alterations of abiotic and biotic conditions in future environments. Our work illustrates that compensatory mechanisms, driving plastic responses to the spatial structure of multiple stressors, can define geographical patterns of unanticipated species resilience to global environmental change. labels: #Biomineralization"
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the dynamic changes of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E5 gene in the development of cervical cancer and the significance of E5 mRNA in early screening of cervical cancer.METHODS: Paraffin specimens of cervical lesions were collected from 49 cases (HPV positive) during September 2015 to December 2017 According to the standard of FIGO, all cervical lesions were diagnosed as: 13 cases of cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia disorders (CIN) ? in 5 cases, CIN ? in 18 cases, CIN ? in 5 cases, 8 cases of cervical cancer. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the integrity of E5 gene and the mRNA expression levels of E5, E6 and E 7in cervical tissues.RESULTS: All the 49 cases showed positive HPV16 infection. E5 genetic integrity in CIN?was higher than that in cervical inflammation, CIN ?and cervical cancer (P < 0.05), which was also higher than that in CIN ?, but without statistically significance (P>0.05). The mRNA levels of E5, E6, E7 were the highest in CIN ?. Compared with E6 and E7, E5 presented superior expression in all types of cervical lesions (P < 0.05), while E 6and E7 mRNA expressions only increased in CIN ? and cervical cancer.CONCLUSION: In the patients with HPV16 infection, the integrity of E5 gene in cervical tissues may be related to the occurrence and development of cervical diseases. E5 gene is expected to be the target gene for early screening of cervical cancer. labels: #Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia#Female#Human papillomavirus 16#Humans#Oncogene Proteins, Viral#Papillomavirus Infections#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b'Molluscan nacre is a fascinating biomineral consisting of a highly organized calcium carbonate composite that provides unique fracture toughness and an iridescent color. Organisms elaborately control biomineralization using organic macromolecules. We propose the involvement of the matrix protein Pif80 from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata in the development of the inorganic phase during nacre biomineralization, based on experiments using the recombinant form of Pif80. Through interactions with calcium ions, Pif80 participates in the formation of polymer-induced liquid precursor-like amorphous calcium carbonate granules and stabilizes these granules by forming calcium ion-induced coacervates. At the calcification site, the disruption of Pif80 coacervates destabilizes the amorphous mineral precursors, resulting in the growth of a crystalline structure. The redissolved Pif80 controls the growth of aragonite on the polysaccharide substrate, which contributes to the formation of polygonal tablet structure of nacre. Our findings provide insight into the use of organic macromolecules by living organisms in biomineralization. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 synthesizes membrane-enclosed magnetite (Fe3 O4 ) nanoparticles, magnetosomes, for magnetotaxis. Formation of these organelles involves a complex process comprising key steps which are governed by specific magnetosome-associated proteins. MamB, a cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family member has been implicated in magnetosome-directed iron transport. However, deletion mutagenesis studies revealed that MamB is essential for the formation of magnetosome membrane vesicles, but its precise role remains elusive. In this study, we employed a multi-disciplinary approach to define the role of MamB during magnetosome formation. Using site-directed mutagenesis complemented by structural analyses, fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we show that MamB is most likely an active magnetosome-directed transporter serving two distinct, yet essential functions. First, MamB initiates magnetosome vesicle formation in a transport-independent process, probably by serving as a landmark protein. Second, MamB transport activity is required for magnetite nucleation. Furthermore, by determining the crystal structure of the MamB cytosolic C-terminal domain, we also provide mechanistic insight into transport regulation. Additionally, we present evidence that magnetosome vesicle growth and chain formation are independent of magnetite nucleation and magnetic interactions respectively. Together, our data provide novel insight into the role of the key bifunctional magnetosome protein MamB, and the early steps of magnetosome formation. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and psychological predictors of OHRQoL.METHODS: Cross-sectional clinical and questionnaire study with 332 adolescents aged 11-14 years. The facial profile was classified through photographs and dental malocclusion was classified by the Dental Health Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. The psychosocial variables were assessed by the Aesthetic Component of IOTN, the Orthodontic Aesthetic Subjective Impact Score and the Global Negative Self-Evaluation. OHRQoL was measured using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression models.RESULTS: Higher aesthetic concern and low self-esteem were 3.43 and 3.34 times more likely to affect OHRQoL (p?0.05), respectively. The facial and dental aspects of malocclusion were unrelated to OHRQoL.CONCLUSIONS: Facial and dental aspects of malocclusion were unrelated to OHRQoL, whereas psychosocial variables such as self-perception of orthodontic treatment need and self-esteem predicted adolescents' oral health related quality of life. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Cross-Sectional Studies#Humans#Malocclusion#Oral Health#Quality of Life#Self Concept#Surveys and Questionnaires"
b"Objective: To analyze clinical characteristics and wound repair methods and effects of patients with upper limb electric burns. Methods: Medical records of 136 patients with upper limb electric burn who met the inclusion criteria and hospitalized in our unit from January 2015 to March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Proportion in patients with electric burns in the same period, gender, age, admission time, categories, injury causes, injury voltage, burn area and depth of upper limb, simultaneous injury of both upper limbs, and early wound treatment measure of patients with upper limb electric burn were recorded. The main repair methods of each affected limb were classified and recorded. The overall efficacy of the patients was recorded, including postoperative wound complications and healing condition. The patients repaired with distal pedicled flaps and those with free flaps were followed up for 3 to 6 months. The survival rate of flaps were recorded, the function of affected limbs after operation was evaluated, and the satisfaction degree of patients was investigated by Curative Effect Score Table. The amputation rate, age, and burn area of upper limbs of patients caused by high-voltage and low-voltage electricity were compared. Data were processed with Wilcoxon rank sum test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: (1) The number of upper limb electric burn patients accounted for 88.3% of 154 patients with electric burns hospitalized in the same period, including 117 males and 19 females, aged 1 year and 2 months to 72 years [(34\\xc2\\xb118) years], admitted 1 h to 48 d after injury, including 51 electricians, 32 rural migrant workers, 31 students and preschool children, and 22 patients belonging to other categories. Patients of the first two categories were mainly injured by work accidents, and those of the latter two categories mainly suffered from touching power source or power leakage. Among all the patients, 75 cases were injured by high-voltage electric burn, and 61 cases were injured by low-voltage electric burn, with burn area of upper limb from 0.2% to 16.0% [2% (1%, 5%)] total body surface area (TBSA) and area of wounds deep to bone from 0.2% to 15.0% [2% (1%, 5%)] TBSA. Two upper limbs in 54 cases were simultaneously injured, accounting for 39.7%. Early fasciotomy was performed for 73 limbs. (2) Thirteen affected limbs were treated with dressing change, 2 affected limbs were sutured directly after debridement, 56 affected limbs were repaired by skin grafting, 12 affected limbs were repaired by local flap, 45 affected limbs were repaired by distal pedicled flap, 22 affected limbs were repaired by free flap, and 40 affected limbs were amputated (accounting for 21.1%). (3) One case died of pulmonary infection, sepsis, and multiple organ failure after operation, and the rest patients were all cured. One case with avulsion of abdominal flap was repaired by skin grafting after dressing change. The anterolateral thigh flap in one case necrotized after transplantation, which was replaced by pedicled abdominal flap. Seven cases had small erosion on the pedicle or margin after transplantation of abdominal flap and were healed by dressing change. Six cases had local bruising at the distal end after transplantation of abdominal flap and were healed after conservative treatment such as hyperbaric oxygen. The other flaps survived well. (4) The survival rate of distal pedicled flap grafting was 97.8% (44/45), which was close to that of free flap grafting (95.5%, 21/22, P>0.05). The function recovery of affected limb after free flap grafting was better than that of distal pedicled flap grafting (Z=-3.054, P<0.01), but their satisfaction degree of patients was similar (Z=-0.474, P>0.05). (5) Patients with high-voltage electric burn had higher amputation rate, older age, and larger upper limb burn area than those with low-voltage electric burn (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=4.743, Z=-2.801, -6.469, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: Upper extremity electric burn often occurs in children, electricians, and rural migrant workers with high rate of amputation. Teachers and parents should strengthen safety education for children and manage power source of life well. Workers should improve safety awareness and operate standardly. Fasciotomy for relaxation should be performed for electric burn wound as soon as possible, and flap grafting can effectively repair wound after early debridement. The function recovery of affected upper limb repaired with free flap grafting is better. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Burns, Electric#Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Retrospective Studies#Skin Transplantation#Treatment Outcome#Upper Extremity#Wound Healing#Young Adult"
b'Objective: To establish a nude mouse model of subcutaneous lung cancer using dual fluorescence reporting genes of luciferase (Luc) and near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP). Methods: The Luc and iRFP expressed lentiviral vector was constructed by Gateway method. After verified by sequencing, the lentivirus particle was prepared and infected into lung cancer A549 cells. Successfully infected A549 (mA549) cells were selected by puromycin and amplified. The expression of Luc and iRFP were observed under fluorescence microscope, and the expression of c-Met protein on the cell surface was detected by immunofluorescence. Twelve female nude mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, 6 in each group. A549 and mA549 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right forelimb of nude mice. The growth and fluorescence expression of the tumor were observed by in vivo imaging. The tumor formation was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry. Results: The Luc and iRFP stably expressed mA549 cell line was successfully constructed. The expressions of iRFP and Luc in mA549 cells were observed under fluorescence microscope. The results of immunofluorescence showed that c-Met protein expressed in both A549 cells and mA549 cells. The growth period of mA549 xenograft in nude mice was moderate and the tumorigenesis rate was 100%. The growth trend of mA549 cells in vivo was not significantly different from that of A549 cells (P>0.05). HE staining and immunohistochemistry results showed that the tumor issues displayed typical histopathological features of tumor. Immunohistochemistry results showed that both A549 and mA549 tumors expressed c-Met protein. Conclusion: A stable, real-time monitoring model of iRFP-Luc-A549 lung cancer cell xenograft in nude mice was successfully constructed. labels: #A549 Cells#Animals#Cell Line, Tumor#Female#Fluorescence#Genes, Reporter#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Luciferases#Luminescent Proteins#Lung#Lung Neoplasms#Mice#Mice, Nude#Neoplasm Transplantation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met#Random Allocation'

b'OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the practical use of three prognostic predication models in clinical non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 1 202 clinical non-metastatic RCC patients operated on between 1999 and 2012 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Survival analysis method was used to establish three prognostic prediction models including SSIGN, Leibovich and UISS based on different clinical and pathological indicators. The predictive ability was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS: Of the 1 202 clinical non-metastatic RCC patients, 1 030 cases were limited RCC patients, and 172 cases were locally advanced RCC patients. The median follow-up time of the patients was 63.02 months. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rate were 94.7% and 87.6%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with different clinical stages and grades were significantly different. The predictive accuracies for limited RCC of UISS, SSIGN and Leibovich model were 0.667, 0.785 and 0.758, respectively. For locally advanced RCC, the predictive accuracies of the three models were all lower than 0.6.CONCLUSIONS: SSIGN has certain predictive value in clinical non-metastatic RCC. However, for the advanced RCC, all the prognostic models demonstrate limited predictive value. labels: #Carcinoma, Renal Cell#China#Humans#Kidney Neoplasms#Predictive Value of Tests#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Survival Rate'
b"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as flame retardants and challenges for water treatment due to their persistence and toxicity. In this study, the reduction of 2'2'4'4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) was investigated in a nano-bio-integrated system. Results showed that the introducing of P.\\xc2\\xa0putida could markedly accelerate the demineralization of BDE-47 in nZVI/Pd-P.p system; the continuous generation of acidic metaboliates by P.\\xc2\\xa0putida could decrease pH, which could alleviate the surface passivation to some extent, resulting in the releasing of Fe2+ and high generation of H2O2, the shift in reactive oxygen species from Fe(IV) to \\xe2\\x80\\xa2OH. The BDE-47 was firstly debrominated to the DE by the highly reductive [Pd\\xc2\\xb72H] generated by nZVI/Pd, then oxidized to bromophenol and phenol, catechol as well as hydroquinone via the P.\\xc2\\xa0putida strain and the Fenton-like system. The toxicity assays confirmed the combined system could avert generation of nocuous intermediates, and could be an alternative strategy for complete remediation of recalcitrant POPs. labels: #Biomineralization"
b'Plants have a complex passive fluid transport system capable of internalizing small molecules from the environment, and this system offers an ideal route for augmenting plants with functional nanomaterials. Current plant augmentation techniques use pre-formed nanomaterials and permeabilizing agents or plant cuttings. A so far unexplored concept is the formation of the functional material, in situ, from precursors small enough to be passively internalized through the roots without harming the plants. Metal-organic frameworks are ideal for in situ synthesis as they are composed of metal ions coordinated with organic ligands and have recently been mineralized around single-celled organisms in mild aqueous conditions. Herein, the synthesis of two types of metal-organic frameworks, zinc(2-methylimidazole)2 and lanthanide2 (terephthalate)3 , are reported inside a variety of plants. In situ synchrotron experiments help elucidate the formation kinetics and crystal phases of the nano-biohybrid plants. Plants augmented with luminescent metal-organic frameworks are utilized for small molecule sensing, although other applications, such as pathogen sensing, proton conductive plants, improved CO2 capture, bacteria-free nitrogen fixation, drought and fungi-resistance, and enhanced photosynthesis and photocatalysis, are foreseeable. Overall, the generation of functional materials inside of fully intact plants could lead to more complex nano-biohybrid sensors and organisms augmented with superior performance characteristics. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To observe the clinical application effect of blood circulation enhancement technique in repairing large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities with super large free anterolateral thigh flap. Methods: From March 2014 to March 2017, 6 patients with large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities were hospitalized in our unit, including 5 males and 1 female, aged 27-65 years, 1 case of electric injury, 2 cases of coal burn, 3 cases of traffic injury, 2 cases involving upper limb, and 4 cases involving lower limb. After debridement, the wound area ranged from 26 cm?8 cm to 36 cm?15 cm, and the bone exposure area ranged from 24 cm?7 cm to 35 cm?14 cm. The blood circulation enhancement technique was used when the wound with bone exposure was repaired with super large free anterolateral thigh flap. The area of flaps ranged from 28 cm?10 cm to 38 cm?16 cm. The donor site of flap and the primary wound without bone exposure were repaired with medial thigh split-thickness skin graft of the donor leg of flap. The blood circulation enhancement technique mode during operation and the survival of flaps after operation were recorded, and the recovery of donor and recipient areas and the occurrence of complications were followed up. Results: Three patients were treated with simple vascular supercharging technique during flap transplantation, and the other 3 patients were treated with vascular supercharging and turbocharging technique during flap transplantation. All the flaps survived well in 6 patients without vascular crisis. Follow-up for 3 to 12 months after surgery showed that the blood flow of the flaps was good and the depth and superficial sensation recovered to varying degrees. Except for 1 case of upper limb flap, the other flaps had no obvious swelling and needed no second thinning. There were only depressed scars in the donor sites, and no obvious scar hyperplasia in the area without bone exposure repaired by the skin grafts. No short-term or long-term complications were found. Conclusions: The application of blood circulation enhancement technique in repairing large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities with super large free anterolateral thigh flaps provides reliable blood supply for the flaps and results in good effect after operation, which is worth popularizing. labels: #Adult#Aged#Female#Free Tissue Flaps#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Thigh#Treatment Outcome'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the protective effects of quercetin (QE) on triptolide (TP) induced liver injury and the relevant mechanism.METHODS: Forty C57BL/6 mice were equally divided into 4 groups, control group, TP model group, 20 mg/kg QE treatment group and 80 mg/kg QE treatment group randomly. The 20 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg QE groups were gastrointestinal administration with QE at the dose of 0.2 mL/10 g for 10 d, twice daily, while other groups were administrated with equivalent normal saline. Four hours post the last dose, animals were gastrointestinal administered with TP at a dose of 500 \\xc3\\xacg/kg per mouse, except for NS control. All the mice were sacrificed 22 h later, blood and liver tissue samples were collected. The pathologic change of liver tissue was detected by HE staining. The level of aminotransferase (AST) and aspartate alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum, and the level of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver tissue homogenates were detected using the commercial kits. The level of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-10 and IL-6 in liver tissue homogenates was measured by ELISA. Hepatic expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was detected by Western blot.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, in the TP model group, hepatic lobule structure atrophied and even disappeared, hepatic cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration are obvious. Additionally, in TP model group, serum ALT, AST and MDA levels were significantly increased, SOD and GSH levels were decreased, IL-6 and IL-17 levels were increased, IL-10 levels were decreased, and TLR4 protein levels were increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the TP model group, liver tissue injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were reduced in the QE group, and serum levels of ALT, AST, MDA, IL-6 and IL-17 were all decreased. TLR4 expression was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in both QE groups, and the decease levle was more significant in the high-dose QE group (P < 0.05, compared with the low-dose QE group).CONCLUSION: Quercetin can reduce TP-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative damage, promoting antioxidant and regulating cytokine secretion. labels: #Animals#Antioxidants#Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury#Cytokines#Diterpenes#Epoxy Compounds#Liver#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Oxidative Stress#Phenanthrenes#Quercetin#Random Allocation'
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of Gd-BOPTA enhanced MRI in the staging of liver fibrosis. Method: Fifty male SD rats (6-week-old, 180-220 g) were divided into the modeling group (n=42) and the control group (n=8). The model of liver fibrosis in the modeling group was established by carbon tetrachloride (animal license No. SYXK (Su) 2017-0043). From week 2 to week 10, rats in the modeling group (n=4) and control group (n=1) were randomly selected to scan 1 h(RER1), 2 h(RER2) and 3 h(RER3) after injection of Gd-BOPTA, respectively, to measure the relative enhancement rate (RER) of liver parenchyma. The shape of intrahepatic bile duct and the degree of enhancement at each time point were observed. Results: Forty-two rats (34 rats in the modeling group and 8 rats in the control group) completed the experiment. RER1, RER2 and RER3 of the control group were 1.44\\xc2\\xb10.37, 1.22\\xc2\\xb10.37 and 0.84\\xc2\\xb10.28 respectively. RER1, RER2 and RER3 of the modeling group were respectively: S1 (n=6): 1.49\\xc2\\xb10.48, 1.29\\xc2\\xb10.39, 0.91\\xc2\\xb10.38;S2 (n=9): 1.48\\xc2\\xb10.44, 1.34\\xc2\\xb10.37, 1.04\\xc2\\xb10.40;S3 (n=11): 1.49\\xc2\\xb10.43, 1.37\\xc2\\xb10.39, 1.21\\xc2\\xb10.30; S4 (n=8): 1.49\\xc2\\xb10.44, 1.40\\xc2\\xb10.37, 1.24\\xc2\\xb10.40. There was no significant difference in RER1 and RER2 values between the control group and the liver fibrosis group (F=0.022, P=0.999; F=0.301, P=0.875). There were significant differences between the control group and RER3 values of hepatic fibrosis stage S3 and S4 (t=2.249, P=0.031; t=2.274, P=0.029), there was no significant difference between the remaining groups (all P>0.05).In the control group, the intrahepatic bile duct was obviously strengthened within 1 hour after enhancement, and walked naturally. The intrahepatic bile duct was slightly enhanced 1h after the enhancement of S3-S4 stage of hepatic fibrosis, and the intrahepatic bile duct was significantly enhanced 2-3 hours later, with distorted alignment. Conclusion: Delayed 3 hours liver parenchymal RER and intrahepatic bile duct distortion delay enhancement after Gd-BOPTA enhancement contribute to the S3-S4 diagnosis of liver fibrosis. labels: #Animals#Contrast Media#Gadolinium DTPA#Liver Cirrhosis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Meglumine#Organometallic Compounds#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Efficient pH regulation is a fundamental requisite of all calcifying systems in animals and plants but with the underlying pH regulatory mechanisms remaining largely unknown. Using the sea urchin larva, this work identified the SLC4 HCO3- transporter family member SpSlc4a10 to be critically involved in the formation of an elaborate calcitic endoskeleton. SpSlc4a10 is specifically expressed by calcifying primary mesenchyme cells with peak expression during de novo formation of the skeleton. Knock-down of SpSlc4a10 led to pH regulatory defects accompanied by decreased calcification rates and skeleton deformations. Reductions in seawater pH, resembling ocean acidification scenarios, led to an increase in SpSlc4a10 expression suggesting a compensatory mechanism in place to maintain calcification rates. We propose a first pH regulatory and HCO3- concentrating mechanism that is fundamentally linked to the biological precipitation of CaCO3. This knowledge will help understanding biomineralization strategies in animals and their interaction with a changing environment. labels: #Biomineralization'

b'Lubricious polymer coatings are increasingly used on intravascular devices to facilitate easier access and navigation through tortuous blood vessels. Recent reports highlight the separation and downstream embolism of polymer particles affecting the vasculature and various organs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledges polymer coating embolism as an iatrogenic complication of intravascular devices and continues to close gaps in standards related to coating integrity. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation established particulate testing as an industry standard for evaluating coating integrity of intravascular devices. The FDA recognizes this standard; however, challenges exist in setting particulate limits that may compromise device function without sufficient clinical data. The microscopic nature of polymer emboli not visible with available imaging modalities has impacted reporting. This has also resulted in a reduced number of manufacturer-driven product development projects related to coating integrity. On the other hand, recent procedural trends have supported the innovation of coated devices with expanded indications, requiring particulate evaluations and release limits. This article proposes a methodology to set particulate limits for intravascular devices given existing clinical, regulatory, and manufacturing challenges. The approach with standardization requirements enables characterization, comparison, and evaluation of lubricious coatings from various manufacturers. It incorporates a step-by-step procedure that adds scrutiny to the application of coatings while ensuring device function is not impacted. Together with particulate assessments, clinicopathologic and animal studies permit an understanding of particulate ranges from commercially available devices and setting of particulate limits for new device evaluations. labels: #Animals#Coated Materials, Biocompatible#Embolism#Polymers#United States#United States Food and Drug Administration'
b'OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of Guben Zenggu Decoction on bone metabolism and bone microstructure in ovariectomized rats for the purpose of preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.METHODS: Osteoporosis rat models were established by ovariectomy. The model rats were randomly divided into control, estradiol valerate treatment, and Guben Zenggu Decoction treatment groups with high, medium and low dosages. After 12 weeks of treatments, 10 rats from each group were randomly selected for cardiac blood sampling after abdominal anesthesia. The serum levels of estradiol (E2), osteocalcin (BGP), carboxyterminal of type ? procollagen (PICP), collagen type ? pyridine crosslinking peptide (ICTP) and acid tartaric acid phosphatase-5b (TRAP-5b) were determined by ELISA. Bone histomorphometric analysis was performed on the right femoral specimen of rats using micro-CT imaging.RESULTS: The models rats had lower levels of E2, bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and relative bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), number of trabeculae (Tb.N) and connectivity density (Conn.D), and higher levels of BGP, ICTP, PICP, TRAP-5b and degree of trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), structural model index (SMI) than their normal counterparts (P < 0.05). Estradiol valerate and Guben Zenggu Decoction treatments increased the levels of E2, BALP, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Conn.D significantly (P < 0.05). Higher doses of Guben Zenggu Decoction resulted in higher changes (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Guben Zenggu Decoction can improve bone metabolism and bone micro-structure in ovariectomized rats, thus playing a preventive and therapeutic role in postmenopausal osteoporosis. labels: #Animals#Bone Density#Bone and Bones#Drugs, Chinese Herbal#Female#Osteoporosis#Ovariectomy#Random Allocation#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#X-Ray Microtomography'
b'Southern right whales Eubalaena australis (SRWs) migrate to southern Brazil for breeding and calving from June through November. Overall, there is scarce knowledge on health status and pathologic conditions in SRWs. We report the pathologic and molecular investigation results of 8 SRWs that were necropsied between 2010 and 2017 within a breeding and calving ground in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The animals were of various ages (7 newborns/calves, 1 adult) and sex (3 females, 5 males). Five whales stranded dead; 3 stranded alive and died shortly after (n = 2) or were euthanized (n = 1). The causes of stranding and/or death were neonatal respiratory distress syndrome with meconium aspiration (n = 3) with concomitant congenital hepatopathy in one of them; trauma of unknown origin (n = 3), infectious renal and lung disease with presumed sepsis (n = 1), and euthanasia (n = 1). Three animals were PCR-positive for cetacean morbillivirus; one of them also had morbilliviral antigen in kidney via immunohistochemical analysis. These results, integrating novel findings and a published report, contribute to the pathology knowledge of this species. labels: #Animals#Brazil#Cause of Death#Communicable Diseases#Female#Male#Meconium Aspiration Syndrome#Whales'
b"Public parks are leisure environments widely used by both, adults and children, often accompained by their pets. Soil contamination of these environments by enteric viruses and intestinal parasites occurs through these animals feces. The aim of this work was to detect Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPV-1) and different species of Mastadenovirus in soils samples from a park located in a medium-sized city in Brazil and evaluate the presence of helminth eggs and larvae in 18 points of a public park soil samples, as well as feces found on this site during six months. Parasitological analyzes were conducted through flotation and sedimentation techniques, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for viral detection. Of the 216 soil and 16 feces samples, 49% (106/216) and 12% (2/16) were positivefor nematodes larvae, respectively, through sedimentation techniques. Toxocara spp eggs were found in one soil sample and one feces sample, Trichuris spp eggs were found in only one feces sample and Hookworms eggs were found in four soil samples. After reconstruction work in the streets near the park, 30% (64/216) of the samples were positive for Human Mastadenovirus C (HAdV-C), 1.4% (3/216) for HAdV-E and 0.4% (1/216) for Canine Mastadenovirus A (CAdV-A). The parasitic forms found in this study have demonstrated that the contamination of the park's soil pose a threat to human and animal health. This was the first study to report the presence of HAdVs and CAdVs in soil samples. labels: #Ancylostomatoidea#Animals#Dogs#Feces#Humans#Mastadenovirus#Parks, Recreational#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Soil#Soil Microbiology#Toxocara"
b'RATIONALE: Vaginal stone is a rare condition that is often misdiagnosed due to its low incidence. It can be divided into 2 types, primary vaginal and secondary vaginal, based on the etiology of the disease. Vaginal stones involve pathologic calcification. The formation of vaginal stones is mainly due to stasis and urine infection. We describe a procedure for the safe extraction of vaginal stones.PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 25-year-old female patient with congenital genitourinary malformation and urethrovaginal fistula. A urogenital tract malformation repair operation was performed before she was 21 years old. Frequency of urination occurred before and after menstruation for 9 years, and dyspareunia occurred for 1 year.DIAGNOSES: B ultrasound examination showed a 59\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a55\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a23\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm fusiform region of increased signal intensity in the vagina followed by a sound shadow. We performed a gynecologic examination and found that the long diameter of the vaginal opening was 20\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm. A brown substance observed in her vagina had a hard texture and felt like a stone, and a palpation hand test revealed the size was approximately 60\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a50\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm. A cystoscope was inserted into the urethra and revealed that the broken end of the urethra was connected to the vagina. The proximal broken end of the urethra was 20\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm from the distal end.INTERVENTIONS: The purpose of this operation was to make a definite diagnosis and remove the stones. We performed vaginal stone removal surgery and cystoscopy under anesthesia.OUTCOMES: We removed the stone successfully. The patient was discharged from the hospital after a smooth recovery without any complications. Follow-up was conducted 1 month after the operation and then every 3 months.LESSONS: Although vaginal stones are rare, we must pay attention to this disease, especially in patients with congenital genitourinary malformations and urethrovaginal or vesicovaginal fistulas. Obstruction of urine discharge combined with repeated urinary tract infection is the main cause of vaginal stone formation. For these patients, follow-up every 3 months, including a physical examination, B-mode ultrasonography of the urinary system and cystoscopy if necessary, can avoid the occurrence of the disease. labels: #Adult#Calculi#Female#Humans#Urethral Diseases#Urinary Fistula#Vaginal Diseases#Vaginal Fistula'
b'Scopelophila ligulata is an Fe-hyperaccumulator moss growing in acidic environments, but the mechanism of Fe accumulation remains unknown. To understand the mechanism, we determined Fe species in S. ligulata samples. The moss samples were collected from four sites in Japan. The concentrations of Fe, P, S, Cl, and K in them were measured by induced coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Fe species in some of them were determined by M?ssbauer spectroscopy and were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Fe species in S. ligulata samples were determined to be jarosite, ferritin, high-spin Fe(II) species, and akaganeite. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the biomineralization of jarosite in mosses. This result, combined with the fact that bacteria, a fungus, and a grass mineralize jarosite, suggests that its biomineralization is a common characteristic in a wide variety of living organisms. These findings indicate that the biomineralization of jarosite occurs not only in the region-specific species but in species adapted to a low-pH and metal-contaminated environment in different regions, provide a better understanding of the mechanism of Fe accumulation in the Fe-hyperaccumulator moss S. ligulata, and offer new insights into the biomineralization of jarosite. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Sequestration of arsenic to biogenic sulfide minerals is known from As-contaminated anoxic environments. Despite numerous successful laboratory experiments, the process remains difficult to predict in moderate arsenic conditions. We performed microcosm experiments using naturally contaminated groundwater (containing ca. 6\\xc2\\xa0mg/L As) and natural organic matter (NOM) particles both collected from wetland soil. Macroscopic realgar precipitates, occasionally accompanied by bonazziite, a FeS phase, elementary S, calcite, and whewellite, appeared after 4 to 18\\xc2\\xa0months. Realgar only precipitated in microcosms moderately poisoned by azide or antibiotics and those in which oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur took place. The biomineralization process was not affected by the presence of additional carbon sources or the diversity, community structure, and functional composition of the microbial community. Hydrogen sulfide concentration was greater in the realgar-free microcosms, suggesting that arsenic thiolation prevented precipitation of realgar. We compared our data to available microbial community data from soils with different rates of realgar precipitation, and found that the communities from realgar-encrusted NOM particles usually showed limited sulfate reduction and the presence of fermentative metabolisms, whereas communities from realgar-free NOM particles were strongly dominated by sulfate reducers. We argue that the limited sulfate supply and intensive fermentation amplify reducing conditions, which make arsenic sulfide precipitation plausible in high-sulfate, low-arsenic groundwaters. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"AIM: To evaluate the inflammatory response, biomineralization and production of osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) of a new root filling material for primary teeth (Bio-C Pulpecto) compared to MTA.DESIGN: Polyethylene tubes containing Bio-C Pulpecto, MTA, and empty tubes were implanted into the dorsal connective tissue. After 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90\\xc2\\xa0days, the tubes with surrounding tissue were removed and histologically processed to be analysed using haematoxylin and eosin, von Kossa staining, or no staining for observation under polarized light and immunohistochemistry for the detection of OCN, OPN, and BSP. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used followed by Dunn's test. The significance level was set at 5%.RESULTS: The inflammatory response observed with MTA and Bio-C Pulpecto was more exacerbated until the 15th day and decreased from 30\\xc2\\xa0days on. No significant difference was found between control, MTA, and Bio-C Pulpecto (P\\xc2\\xa0>\\xc2\\xa00.05). Bio-C Pulpecto and MTA showed positivity for von Kossa and birefringent to polarized light. The immunolabelling for OCN, OPN, and BSP was more intense for MTA and Bio-C Pulpecto on days 60 and 90 (P\\xc2\\xa0>\\xc2\\xa00.05).CONCLUSION: Bio-C Pulpecto was biocompatible, induced biomineralization and was immunopositive for osteogenic markers such as OCN, OPN, and BSP, similarly to MTA. labels: #Biomineralization"
b"PURPOSE: This prospective study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of 'All-on-four' rehabilitations in controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Edentulous patients requiring an implant prosthetic restoration of one or both jaws were enrolled in the present study. Each patient received at least one fixed full-arch prosthesis. Four implants, immediately loaded, were placed in each jaw using the 'All-on-four' protocol. Marginal bone loss, implant and prosthetic failure, biological and mechanical complications, and serological levels (CD4 cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and HIV viral load) were recorded up to 7-year follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 116 implants were placed in 24 patients, and 29 rehabilitations based on the 'All-on-four' concept were achieved. Implant failures were registered in four patients (10 of 116 implants), and the implant survival rate was 91.37%. At the 7-year radiographic evaluation, peri-implant crestal bone loss averaged 1.91 \\xc2\\xb1 1.3 mm for upright maxillary implants (n = 30 implants) and 1.79 \\xc2\\xb1 1.28 mm for tilted maxillary implants (n = 30 implants). In the mandible, mean peri-implant crestal bone loss was 1.54 \\xc2\\xb1 1.27 mm for upright implants (n = 28) and 1.5 \\xc2\\xb1 1.3 mm for tilted implants (n = 28). No statistically significant correlation was found between serological parameters and marginal bone levels at 6 months, or through 7 years of annual follow-up (P > 0.05). A statistically significant linear correlation (P < 0.001) was found between early implant failure and HIV viral load. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly correlated with late implant failure (P = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this prospective 7-year longitudinal study, HIV-positive patients with a stable immune system can be candidates for the 'All-on-four' treatment concept. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Implants#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Prospective Studies"
b'Objective: To explore the characteristics of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism in twin pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: The clinical features of twin and singleton pregnancies complicated by GDM, which delivered in Peking University First Hospital from January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 286 twin pregnancies with GDM (GDM-T group) were collected, and 572 singleton pregnancies complicated by GDM (GDM-S group) which were matched by delivery time in a ratio of 1?2 among all singleton pregnancies with GDM. The characteristics of maternal glucolipid metabolism in the second trimesters of pregnancy was compared between two groups. Results: (1) Compared with GDM-S group, the maternal delivery age were lower [(32\\xc2\\xb14), (33\\xc2\\xb14) years] and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) were higher [(24\\xc2\\xb14), (23\\xc2\\xb14) kg/m(2)] in GDM-T group, the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). The incidence of chronic hypertension was found no significant difference (P=0.581). (2) The 3 points of glucose values in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and OGTT-area under curve (AUC) had no significant difference between GDM-T and GDM-S group.When compared with GDM-S group, the maternal glycosylated hemoglobin levels [(5.41\\xc2\\xb10.35)%, (5.32\\xc2\\xb10.28)%], the insulin resistance index (4.07\\xc2\\xb10.77, 2.63\\xc2\\xb11.50) and the proportion of insulin use (7.7%, 4.4%) were all significantly higher in GDM-T group (all P<0.05). The values of triglyceride [(3.4\\xc2\\xb11.4), (2.6\\xc2\\xb11.2) mmol/L], total cholesterol [(6.3\\xc2\\xb11.1), (6.0\\xc2\\xb11.0) mmol/L], low density lipoprotein cholesterol [(3.3\\xc2\\xb10.9), (3.1\\xc2\\xb10.8) mmol/L] were significantly higher and values of high density lipoprotein cholesterol [(1.7\\xc2\\xb10.4), (2.0\\xc2\\xb10.5) mmol/L] were significantly lower in GDM-T group than GDM-S group (all P<0.05). (3) There was no significant difference in the incidence of gestational hypertension between the two groups (P>0.05). When compared with GDM-S group, the incidences of preeclampsia and small for gestational age were both significantly higher (13.3% vs 2.4%; 28.7% vs 1.7%) and the incidence of large for gestational age was significantly lower in GDM-T group (4.5% vs 15.2%; all P<0.05). Conclusions: The insulin resistance is aggravated in twin pregnancies and the characteristics of lipid metabolism are different between singleton and twin pregnant women complicated by GDM, and there are more complications in twin GDM pregnancies. labels: #Blood Glucose#Diabetes, Gestational#Female#Glucose Tolerance Test#Humans#Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced#Pregnancy#Pregnancy, Twin#Retrospective Studies'
b'Radiation-induced bowel injury is a common complication of radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy. Given the huge number of patients diagnosed with pelvic malignancy, the number of patients diagnosed with radiation-induced bowel injury increased year by year, which put a great burden on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of radiation-induced bowel injury. In particular, chronic radiation-induced bowel injury, which is manifested in the process of prolonged, repeated and progressive aggravation, seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients and makes clinical diagnosis and treatment difficult. However, due to insufficient attention and understanding from doctors and patients, standardized diagnosis and treatment of radiation-induced bowel injury still have a long way to go. Radiation-induced bowel injury is self-limited but irreversible. During diagnosis, we should pay attention to overall evaluation of the stage of disease based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic examination, imaging examination, pathology and nutritional risk. The treatment methods include health education, drug therapy, enema therapy, formalin local treatment, endoscopic treatment and surgical treatment, etc. The treatment decision-making should be based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic or imaging findings to alleviate the clinical symptoms of patients as the primary goal and to improve the long-term quality of life of patients as the ultimate goal. labels: #Chronic Disease#Humans#Intestinal Diseases#Intestines#Pelvic Neoplasms#Quality of Life#Radiation Injuries#Radiotherapy'
b'Objective: To investigate the effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) knockdown on proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and explore the mechanism. Methods: The expression levels of HO-1 mRNA in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H358 and H1993) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression level of HO-1 in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens. The HO-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was transfected into A549 cells by RNA interference technique. HO-1 stably deleted A549 cells were selected (HO-1 shRNA group) and verified by RT-qPCR and western blot. HO-1 shRNA A549 cells and control shRNA A549 cells were treated with the inducer of autophagy Torin1 or its inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), respectively. The expressions of autophagic markers LC3B and p62 were determined by western blot. The proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of each group of A549 cells were assessed by cell counting, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. Results: The expressions of HO-1 mRNA in lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H358 and H1993) were significantly higher than that of HBECs, and HO-1 upregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of p62 protein and the ratio of LC3B-?/ LC3B-? in no treatment group, Torin1 treatment group and Baf A1 treatment group were significantly higher than those of the corresponding control group (P<0.05). After 11 days of culture, the number of cells in HO-1 shRNA group were 41.8%, 30.4% and 14.0% of the corresponding control group, respectively. The number of lower chamber cells in HO-1 shRNA group were (35.7\\xc2\\xb12.1), (27.0\\xc2\\xb11.0) and (38.0\\xc2\\xb11.0)/field, respectively, which were lower than (66.0\\xc2\\xb19.2), (39.3\\xc2\\xb11.2) and (43.0\\xc2\\xb12.6)/field of the corresponding control group, respectively (P<0.05). The migration distances of HO-1 shRNA group were (7.47\\xc2\\xb10.91) mm, (4.23\\xc2\\xb10.82) mm and (5.42\\xc2\\xb10.24) mm, which were lower than (10.07\\xc2\\xb11.26) mm, (7.14\\xc2\\xb10.07) mm and (12.04\\xc2\\xb10.80) mm of the corresponding control groups, respectively (P<0.05). Conclusion: Knockdown of HO-1 inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of A549 cells by impeding autophagy. labels: #A549 Cells#Adenocarcinoma of Lung#Autophagy#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Gene Knockdown Techniques#Heme Oxygenase-1#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Neoplasm Invasiveness#RNA, Small Interfering'
b'In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZnO-NPs) and also chitosan\\xe2\\x80\\x91zinc oxide (CS-ZnO-NPs) nano-hybrid were synthesized by a rapid ultrasound assisted co-precipitation method. The morphology, chemical bonding, crystal structure, UV absorption, toxicity and antibacterial properties of the CS-ZnO-NPs and ZnO-NPs were characterized. The FE-SEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy) micrographs and XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis revealed that the used technique led to the preparation of homogeneous, ultra-thin (thickness of 20-30\\xe2\\x80\\xafnm) and highly pure ZnO sheets for the both kinds of nanoparticles. The obtained results also demonstrated a superior performance of CS-ZnO-NPs hybrid rather than ZnO-NPs in terms of antibacterial activity, cell viability and UV absorption. It was deduced that the designed biomineralization technique was a very fast and successful strategy to provide a ZnO hybrid with elevated bacterial growth inhibition and bio-safety. Furthermore, the experimental data of antibacterial analyses were compared with the curves obtained from modified Gompertz model and good accordance was observed. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To explore related factors affecting evolution of recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI) with small-artery occlusion. Methods: A total of 96 RSSI patients with RSSI were admitted from Shanghai Tongji Hospital between January 2015 and December 2018. The age of patients containing 60 men was 64.5 (58-73) years, and MRI follow-up time was 11.6 (6.3-11.8) months. Clinical information of patients, images data at baseline head MRI and evolution outcomes at follow-up MRI were collected. All patients were divided into cavitation group (lacunes) and no cavitation group (white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and disappearance) to analyze related factors. Results: Fifty-nine cases (61.5%) developed to cavities, 32 cases (33.3%) were focal WMH, and 5 cases (5.2%) disappeared.In the univariate analysis, RSSI maximum diameter on the DWI or T(2)WI sequence of cavitation group was significantly higher than non-cavitation group, but male proportion was lower (11.6 (9.9-16.6) vs 8.6 (6.9-13.0) mm, 11.8 (9.7-16.2) vs 8.8 (6.7-13.1) mm, 54.2% vs 75.7%, all P<0.05). In Logistic regression analysis,the maximum diameter on DWI sequence was an independent predictor of cavity formation (P=0.022,OR=1.138).When conducting quantitative analysis of infarct diameter and taking infarct maximum diameter ?10 mm group as reference, the cavitation risk of maximum diameter>15 mm group was about 7.5 times higher (P=0.010, OR=7.464). The maximum diameter of 10-15 mm lost predictive value for cavity formation (P=0.129, OR=2.444). Conclusions: About 61.5% of RSSI develop to cavitation and 38.5% to WMH or disappear. The RSSI showing larger diameter on DWI has a greater possibility of cavitation. labels: #Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases#China#Female#Humans#Leukoaraiosis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male'
b'The Australian native marine fish species, silver sweep Scorpis lineolata, is susceptible to the megalocytivirus Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (strain DGIV-10) obtained from a freshwater ornamental fish, dwarf gourami Trichogaster lalius. This was demonstrated by direct inoculation and through cohabitation. Transmission by cohabitation was also demonstrated from inoculated freshwater Murray cod Maccullochella peelii to euryhaline Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata and to marine silver sweep. The virus was also transmitted from infected marine silver sweep to euryhaline Australian bass and then to freshwater Murray cod. This study is the first to demonstrate the virulence of a megalocytivirus derived from ornamental fish in an Australian marine species and the first to show a feasible pathway for the exchange of megalocytiviruses between freshwater and marine finfish hosts. These results demonstrate that megalocytiviruses from freshwater ornamental fish have the potential to spread to diverse aquatic environments. labels: #Animals#Australia#DNA Virus Infections#Fish Diseases#Fresh Water#Iridoviridae#Phylogeny'
b'The accurate imaging of the lymph nodes represents a critical indicator for tumor staging and surgical planning (e.g., osteosarcoma). Clinically, nodal tracing using a radio-nanocolloid is often limited by the inaccessibility of real-time images and inadequate anatomical information. Herein, we present a 99mTc-labeled biomineralization nanoprobe for the advanced detection of osteosarcoma and lymph nodes with multimodal imaging. Through the exploitation of the complementary strengths of MRI/SPECT/NIR fluorescence, the fabricated nanoprobe exhibited suitable stability and biocompatibility characteristics and was shown to be able to be located in osteosarcoma. The lymphatic drainage and network in healthy mice were imaged in real-time using NIR fluorescence and SPECT/CT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our 99mTc-biomineralization nanoprobe could be used for the high-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging analysis of lymphatic drainage in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Overall, the 99mTc-labeled biomineralization nanoprobe features promising characteristics to be used as an intraoperative visualization tool to aid in precise tumor imaging and nodal resection. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different nose types on the perception of facial aesthetics following camouflage treatment and orthognathic surgery for skeletal class II female patients.METHODS: A pre-treatment profile photograph of a skeletal class II adult patient was selected from the department archive. Two constructed photographs were created to represent orthognathic surgery and camouflage treatments with the aid of computer software. A total of 18 constructed images was composed using three profiles (pre-treatment, post-camouflage, and post-orthognathic surgery) and six nose types. These photographs were shown to the three groups (orthodontists, plastic surgeons, and lay people), and they were asked to assign an attractiveness score to each photo ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the least attractive and 100 indicating the most attractive.RESULTS: For the convex nose profiles, anterior movement of the mandible obtained by orthognathic surgery did not result in a significant change in the scores given by the lay people. When surgical or camouflage treatment was not implemented and, instead, just rhinoplasty was performed for these profiles, there was a significant increase in the aesthetic scores given by all groups. For the straight nose profiles, orthognathic surgery increased the attractiveness scores given by all groups. Furthermore, for all the profiles, extraction treatment did not affect the aesthetic scores given by any of the groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The lay people perceived that having a convex-bridged nose was a bigger problem than having a retrognathic profile. Overall, in terms of skeletal and dental orthodontic treatments, nose shape should be considered during the treatment planning process. labels: #Adult#Esthetics, Dental#Face#Female#Humans#Nose#Orthognathic Surgery#Orthognathic Surgical Procedures'
b'PURPOSE: To compare the 3-year outcomes of immediately loaded and one-stage conventionally loaded variable-thread tapered implants in the posterior maxilla.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a split-mouth randomised controlled trial. Twenty-six patients attending the postgraduate Periodontics Department at the Lebanese University, and missing teeth bilaterally in the posterior maxilla were randomised. All patients received three to four implants in each of the posterior sextants. The implants on one side were immediately loaded with a provisional resin fixed partial denture on definitive multi-unit abutments regardless of their primary stability. The implants in the contralateral side received definitive multi-unit abutments according to the one-stage unloaded protocol. Three to 3.5 months following implant placement, the implants were restored with metal-ceramic fixed prostheses. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis failure rates, complications, and peri-implant bone level changes up to 3 years following delivery of the definitive prosthesis. The clinical outcomes and radiographic measurements were performed by a single outcome assessor blinded to the type of interventions.RESULTS: Two patients dropped out prior to the delivery of definitive prostheses. The results were analysed using a per-protocol analysis and included 24 patients. Four implants supporting a four-unit immediately loaded prosthesis failed in one patient, 3 months following definitive prosthesis. In the same patient, the three contralateral conventionally loaded implants failed 14 months after definitive prosthesis. There were no significant differences in the proportions of implant and prosthesis failures at 3 years (difference = 0%; 95% CI 0.0% to 14.2%; P = 0.999). Peri-implantitis was diagnosed at two adjacent conventionally loaded implants in one patient at the 3-year examination. In the immediately loaded group, four early minor prosthetic complications occurred during the provisionalisation phase. Following delivery of the definitive prostheses, one minor ceramic fracture was observed in each of the implant groups. The difference in the rate of complications between the two interventions was not statistically significant at 3 years (difference = 13%; 95% CI 3.4% to 27.7%; P = 0.453). The 3-year peri-implant marginal bone level changes were evaluated in 23 patients (77 immediately loaded and 76 conventionally loaded implants). On average, patients lost 0.79 (0.62) mm at the immediately loaded and 0.91 (0.82) mm at the conventionally loaded implants, the difference being statistically not significant (difference = 0.12 mm; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.55 mm; P = 0.590). The 3-year marginal bone level changes were not significantly different between smokers (n = 12) and non-smokers (n = 11) (difference = 0.19 mm; 95% CI -0.24 to 0.62 mm; P = 0.382).CONCLUSIONS: Immediate loading of three- to four-unit fixed partial prostheses supported by variable-thread implants in the posterior maxilla can achieve similar 3-year results to one-stage conventionally loaded implants. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Denture, Partial, Fixed#Humans#Immediate Dental Implant Loading#Maxilla'
b'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at a higher risk of development of lung cancer. Frequent exacerbations of COPD trigger the disease course to chronic inflammation which likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Previous studies showed influenza virus infection is one of important causes for exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to know whether influenza vaccination could reduce the incidence of lung cancer in patients with COPD.This cohort study enrolled patients (?55 years old) with a recorded diagnosis of COPD between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012 by using the Taiwan Health Insurance Database. A propensity score was calculated to reduce vaccine therapy selection bias. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to investigate the association between the influenza vaccination and lung cancer incidence after adjusting for known confounding factors. Besides, we categorized the patients into 4 groups according to vaccination status (unvaccinated, total number of vaccinations: 1, 2-3, ?4) to evaluate the dose-dependent effect on reducing lung cancer occurrence of lung cancer in COPD patients.Our study comprised of 28,752 eligible individuals from the COPD cohort database. Among them, 51% (14,630) received influenza vaccination; the rest (49%) of the COPD patients did not receive influenza vaccination. We observed that COPD patients receiving influenza vaccination had a lower risk of lung cancer (adjusted HR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.40, 95% CI (0.35-0.45), P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). We also founded comparable protective effect in both sexes and all age groups (55-64, 65-74, ?75) regardless of influenza seasonality. Furthermore, dose-dependent protective effect could be seen after stratifying patients according to the total number vaccinations, the adjusted HRs for lung cancer risk were 0.48 (0.40-0.54) and 0.24 (0.20-0.29) for patients who received 2 to 3 and ?4 vaccinations during the follow-up period.This population-based cohort study demonstrated that annual influenza vaccination administration could reduce incidence of lung cancer in COPD patients. labels: #Aged#Cohort Studies#Disease Progression#Female#Humans#Immunization Schedule#Incidence#Influenza Vaccines#Influenza, Human#Lung Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive'
b'We report methods to generate three-dimensional maps of birefringence, its position and orientation in juvenile shells of the Atlantic hard clamshell (Mercenaria mercenaria).

b'Kinase-family with sequence similarity 20, member C (Fam20C) is a protein kinase, which can phosphorylate biomineralization related proteins in vertebrate animals. However, the function of Fam20C in invertebrate animals especially the role in biomineralization is still unknown. Herein, we cloned the cDNA of fam20C from the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata. It is showed that the expression of fam20C in the mantle edge was much higher than other tissues. In situ hybridization showed that fam20C was expressed mostly in the outer epithelial cells of the middle fold, indicating it may play important roles in the shell formation. Besides, fam20C expression increased greatly in the D-shape stage of pearl oyster development, when the shell was first formed. During the shell repair process, the expression level of fam20C increased 1.5 times at 6\\xe2\\x80\\x89h after shell notching. Knockdown of fam20C in vivo by RNA interference resulted in abnormally stacking of calcium carbonate crystals at the edges of nacre tablets, showing direct evidence that fam20C participates in the shell formation. This study provides an insight into the role of kinase protein in the shell formation in mollusk and broaden our understanding of biomineralization mechanism. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'We aimed to investigate the correlation of homocysteine (Hcy) level with clinical characteristics, and explore its predictive value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk in female patients with premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS).The serum Hcy level was detected from 1299 female patients with premature ACS. According to the tertile of Hcy level, patients were divided into 3 groups: lowest tertile group (?9.1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L), middle tertile group (9.2-11.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L) and highest tertile group (>11.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L). MACE incidence was recorded and MACE-free survival was caculated with the median follow-up duration of 28.3 months.Increased Hcy correlated with older age (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), higher creatinine level (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), and enhanced uric acid level (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), while reduced fasting glucose concentration (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). MACE incidence was 10.7% and it was highest in highest tertile group (22.1%), followed by middle tertile group (7.7%) and lowest tertile group (2.4%) (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that Hcy distinguished MACE patients from non-MACE patients with the area under the curve of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.742-0.835). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that MACE-free survival was shortest in Hcy highest tertile group, followed by middle tertile group and lowest tertile group (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Multivariate Cox analyses further showed that higher Hcy level was an independent predictive factor for poor MACE-free survival (middle tertile vs lowest tertile (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001, HR: 3.615, 95% CI: 1.661-7.864); highest tertile vs lowest tertile (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001, HR: 11.023, 95% CI: 5.356-22.684)).Hcy serves as a potential predictive factor for increased MACE risk in female patients with premature ACS. labels: #Acute Coronary Syndrome#Age Factors#Cardiovascular Diseases#Female#Homocysteine#Humans#Incidence#Middle Aged#Predictive Value of Tests#Risk Assessment'
b"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of different courses of electroacupuncture treatment on the compliance and therapeutic outcome of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis.METHODS: A total of 60 patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis were randomly divided into 5-time treatment group and 10-time treatment group, with 30 patients in each group. With the same electroacupuncture prescription, the patients in the 5-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 5 times in total, and those in the 10-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 10 times in total, with an interval of 2 days between every 5 times of treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of cervical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis before and after treatment, as well as whether and why the patients were willing to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment. The two groups were followed up to observe the recurrence of cervical spondylosis within 12 months.RESULTS: Both groups had significant improvements in cervical VAS score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis after treatment (P<0.05), and there were no significant differences in these scores between the two groups after treatment (P>0.05). There was also no significant difference in long-term recurrence between the two groups (P>0.05). Of the 30 patients in the 10-time treatment group, 21 (70%) showed no willingness to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment since they were satisfied with their treatment outcomes.CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can effectively improve the pain symptom of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis, and compared with 5 times of electroacupuncture treatment, 10 times of electroacupuncture treatment may affect patients' compliance with clinical treatment. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Electroacupuncture#Humans#Spondylosis#Treatment Outcome"
b'Objective: To investigate the alterations of the cerebral resting-state spontaneous neural activity in colorectal cancer patients with depressive symptoms. Methods: Thirty-three colorectal cancer patients (patient group) with depression and 43 healthy subjects (control group) underwent the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were calculated. Two independent samples t test were used to compare the ALFF and fALFF values between two groups by DPABI software, and then correlation analysis was performed between ALFF and fALFF with statistical significance and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scores. Results: Compared with the control group, the patient group showed significantly lower ALFF and fALFF values in the bilateral precuneus, calcarine gyrus, lingual gyrus, left cuneus, superior, middle, inferior occipital gyrus and right fusiform gyrus (t=-5.730, P<0.05; t=-4.872, P<0.05). There were no significant correlations between the ALFF and fALFF values in these regions and PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores (P>0.05). Conclusion: Spontaneous decrease of neural activity in occipital and parietal lobes exists in colorectal cancer patients with depression at resting-sate, which may be a potential neurobiological marker. labels: #Biomarkers#Brain#Case-Control Studies#Colorectal Neoplasms#Depression#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging'
b'Here, we investigate the unfolding behavior of a streptomycin-binding ribonucleic acid (RNA) aptamer under application of force in shear geometry. Using Langevin out-of-equilibrium simulations to emulate the single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiment, we were able to understand the hierarchical unfolding process that occurs in the RNA molecule under application of stretching force and the influence of streptomycin modifying this unfolding. Subsequently, the application of the Jarzynski equality to the force profiles obtained in the pulling simulations shows that the free energies for individual systems and the difference of unfolding free energy upon streptomycin binding to the RNA free aptamer are in fair agreement with the experimental values, obtained through SMFS by Nick et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 120, 6479 (2016)]. labels: #Aptamers, Nucleotide#Microscopy, Atomic Force#Molecular Dynamics Simulation#Nucleic Acid Conformation#Protein Binding#Streptomycin#Thermodynamics'
b'Strongyloidiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis whose treatment is particularly difficult in immunosuppressed patients due to their low responsiveness to conventional therapy. Carica papaya and its isolated compounds benzyl isothiocyanate, carpaine and carpasemine are promising compound for the treatment of Strongyloides infections due to their anthelmintic action. This study aims to examine the in vitro ovicidal and larvicidal activity of C. papaya seed hexane extract against Strongyloides venezuelensis, using egg hatching tests and larval motility tests as efficiency markers. The crude extract at the concentrations of 566 - 0.0566 mg/mL or the control with albendazole (0.025 mg/mL) and negative controls (water and PBS) were incubated with an equal volume of egg suspension (\\xc2\\xb1 50 specimens) followed by counting of the specimens after 48 h. The same extract and dilutions were added to L3 larvae suspensions (\\xc2\\xb150 specimens) followed by analysis of larvae viability after 24, 48, and 72 h. The extract inhibited egg hatching with high efficiency at concentrations of 56.6 mg/mL (95.74%) and 5.66 mg/mL (92.16%). At the concentrations of 566 mg/mL (100%) and 56.66 mg/mL (97.32%), the extract inhibited larval motility as effectively as ivermectin (0.316 mg/mL; 100%), and more effectively than the other dilutions and the negative controls. The larvicidal effect depended on the extract concentration, but not on the treatment period. Therefore, C. papaya seed hexane extract has anthelmintic potential against S. venezuelensis and is a promising compound for the development of phytotherapies to treat strongyloidiasis. labels: #Animals#Carica#Larva#Ovum#Parasitic Sensitivity Tests#Plant Extracts#Seeds#Strongyloides'
b'A large body of evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as expression and function of retinoid receptors, are pivotal features of tumor initiation, progression, and chemoresistance. This is also true for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which represents a clinical challenge due to poor prognosis and increasing incidence. Understanding the above features of cancer cells could open new avenues for PDAC treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between CSCs, EMT, and retinoid receptors in PDAC after treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents - gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil. First, we demonstrated the difference in the expression levels of CSC and EMT markers and retinoid receptors in the untreated Mia PaCa-2 and Panc1 cells that also differed in the frequency of spontaneous apoptosis and distribution between the cell cycle phases. Chemotherapy reduced the number of cancer cells in the S phase. Gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil modulated expression of CSC markers, E-cadherin, and RXR\\xc3\\xa2 in Panc1 but not in Mia PaCa-2 cells. We suggest that these effects could be attributed to the difference in the basal levels of expression of the investigated genes. The obtained data could be interesting in the context of future preclinical research. labels: #Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic#Apoptosis#Cadherins#Cell Line, Tumor#Deoxycytidine#Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition#Fluorouracil#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Humans#Neoplastic Stem Cells#Retinoid X Receptor beta#S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints'
b'Microbial mineralization (corrosion, decomposition, and weathering) has been investigated for its role in the extraction and recovery of metals from ores. Here we report our application of biomineralization for the microbial enhanced oil recovery in low-permeability oil reservoirs. It aimed to reveal the etching mechanism of the four Fe(III)-reducing microbial strains under anaerobic growth conditions on Ca-montmorillonite. The mineralogical characterization of Ca-montmorillonite was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. Results showed that the microbial strains could efficiently reduce Fe(III) at an optimal rate of 71%, alter the crystal lattice structure of the lamella to promote interlayer cation exchange, and efficiently inhibit Ca-montmorillonite swelling at a rate of 48.9%.IMPORTANCE Microbial mineralization is ubiquitous in the natural environment. Microbes in low-permeability reservoirs are able to facilitate alteration of the structure and phase of the Fe-poor minerals by reducing Fe(III) and inhibiting clay swelling, which is still poorly studied. This study aimed to reveal the interaction mechanism between Fe(III)-reducing bacterial strains and Ca-montmorillonite under anaerobic conditions and to investigate the extent and rates of Fe(III) reduction and phase changes with their activities. Application of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria will provide a new way to inhibit clay swelling, to elevate reservoir permeability, and to reduce pore throat resistance after water flooding for enhanced oil recovery in low-permeability reservoirs. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"Acanthurus spp. of St. Kitts and other Caribbean islands, including ocean surgeonfish A. bahianus, doctorfish A. chirurgus, and blue tang A. coeruleus, frequently show multifocal cutaneous pigmentation. Initial reports from the Leeward Antilles raised suspicion of a parasitic etiology. The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of the disease in St. Kitts' Acanthuridae and describe its pathology and etiology. Visual surveys demonstrated consistently high adjusted mean prevalence at 3 shallow reefs in St. Kitts in 2017 (38.9%, 95% CI: 33.8-43.9) and 2018 (51.5%; 95% CI: 46.2-56.9). There were no differences in prevalence across species or reefs, but juvenile fish were less commonly affected than adults. A total of 29 dermatopathy-affected acanthurids were sampled by spearfishing for comprehensive postmortem examination. Digenean metacercariae were dissected from <1 mm cysts within pigmented lesions. Using partial 28S rDNA sequence data they were classified as Family Heterophyidae, members of which are commonly implicated in black spot disease of other fishes. Morphological features of the parasite were most typical of Scaphanocephalus spp. (Creplin, 1842), and 2 genetic profiles were obtained suggesting more than 1 digenean species. Histologically, pigmented lesions had mild chronic perivascular dermatitis and increased melanophores and melanin density, often centered on encysted digenean metacercariae. In 1 affected A. chirurgus, similar metacercariae were histologically identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Further research is needed to clarify impact on host fitness, establish the number of heterophyid digenean species that cause black spots on Caribbean fishes and to determine the intermediate and definitive host species. labels: #Animals#Caribbean Region#Dermatitis#Metacercariae#Perciformes#West Indies"
b"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate, in vivo, the biocompatibility via subcutaneous inflammatory tissue response and mineralization ability of the new MTA Flow compared to MTA Angelus and ProRoot MTA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were assigned and received subcutaneous polyethylene tube implants containing the test materials and a control group with empty tube (n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x8910 animals/group). After days 7, 15, 30, and 60, the animals were euthanized and the polyethylene tubes were removed with the surrounding tissues. Inflammatory infiltrate and thickness of the fibrous capsule were histologically evaluated. Mineralization was analyzed by Von Kossa staining and under polarized light. Data were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's test with a significance level of 5%.RESULTS: MTA Angelus induced the mildest reaction after 7 (P\\xe2\\x80\\x89>\\xe2\\x80\\x89.05) and 15\\xc2\\xa0days (P\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x89.05) followed by MTA Flow, both cements achieving mild inflammatory reaction after 15\\xc2\\xa0days. ProRoot MTA induced a severe inflammation on day 7 and was reducing after day 15 (P\\xe2\\x80\\x89>\\xe2\\x80\\x89.05). No difference was observed after days 30 or 60 (P\\xe2\\x80\\x89>\\xe2\\x80\\x89.05). Von Kossa staining and birefringent structures were positive to all materials.CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the experiment, the novel MTA Flow showed biocompatibility and induced biomineralization in all time periods.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The final consistence obtained in MTA Flow may facilitate several procedures, indicating that the MTA Flow has a promising application in endodontics. labels: #Biomineralization"
b'Development of therapeutic preparations involves several steps, starting with the synthesis of chemical compounds and testing them in different models for selecting the most effective and safest ones to clinical trials and introduction into medical practice. Cultured animal cells (both primary and transformed) are commonly used as models for compound screening. However, cell models display a number of disadvantages, including insufficient standardization (primary cells) and disruption of cell genotypes (transformed cells). Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) offers new possibilities for the development of high-throughput test systems for screening potential therapeutic preparations with different activity spectra. Due to the capacity to differentiate into all cell types of an adult organism, IPSCs are a unique model that allows examining the activity and potential toxicity of tested compounds during the entire differentiation process in vitro. In this work, we demonstrated the efficiency of IPSCs and their neuronal derivatives for selecting substances with the neuroprotective activity using two classes of compounds - melanocortin family peptides and endocannabinoids. None of the tested compounds displayed cyto- or embryotoxicity. Both melanocortin peptides and endocannabinoids exerted neuroprotective effect in the neuronal precursors and IPSC-derived neurons subjected to hydrogen peroxide. The endocannabinoid N-docosahexaenoyl dopamine exhibited the highest neuroprotective effect (~70%) in the differentiated cultures enriched with dopaminergic neurons; the effect of melanocortin Semax was ~40%. The possibility of using other IPSC derivatives for selecting compounds with the neuroprotective activity is discussed. labels: #Cell Differentiation#Cell Proliferation#Cells, Cultured#Dopaminergic Neurons#Embryoid Bodies#Endocannabinoids#Humans#Hydrogen Peroxide#Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells#Melanocortins#Neuroprotective Agents#Oxidative Stress'
b'OBJECTIVES: We analyzed primary school performance of girls with Turner syndrome (TS) in two distinct countries to ascertain if the cognitive phenotype of TS causes selective learning difficulties.METHODS: The cohort comprised of 44 Czech and 50 Egyptian girls with TS who attended public schools. School reports from grades 1 to 9 were obtained retrospectively from Czech participants with TS. Only recent school reports were obtained from Egyptian participants. Two controls per participant were requested - biological sisters and/or female classmates. The results were converted into a 5-point scale (1-excellent; 5-unsatisfactory).RESULTS: Analysis of longitudinal Czech data displayed a strong time component in both subjects and controls. Showing better points in lower grades with its gradual worsening as the education complexity increased. In contrast, there was a strong statistically significant difference between groups in Mathematics (p=0.0041, p=0.0205 after Bonferroni correction) and this difference increased over time. The points for Mathematics did not differ in grades 1+2 (0.05 difference in mean grade between the two groups), however, they differed by 0.28 in grades 6+7 and by 0.32 in grades 8+9. While slightly different in character (cross-sectional vs. longitudinal), the Egyptian cohort data confirmed our findings, showing no difference in general school performance but having similar trends in Mathematics (grades 1+2: 0.11, grades 6+7: 0.54, grades 8+9: 0.68; p=0.0058, p=0.029 after Bonferroni correction).CONCLUSION: Excluding results in Mathematics, which showed pronounced worsening in relation to age in comparison with unaffected controls, girls with TS performed similarly to their controls. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Cohort Studies#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Mathematics#Retrospective Studies#Turner Syndrome'
b'Objective: To clarify the effect of TRAF2 in the biological behavior of gastric cancer and explore the mechanism. Methods: TRAF2 stably depleted AGS cell was established. Cell growth was monitored by x-CELLigence system. Cell proliferation was detected using cell viability assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. The difference of migration and invasion abilities were measured by real-time xCELLigence system and Transwell. The expression and activity of NF-\\xc3\\xaaB signaling pathway were measured by western blot and TransAM assay. The expression of TRAF2 in gastric cancer tissue and its clinical significance were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The cell index of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was significantly lower than that of AGS-sictrl cells at 8 h. In the cell viability assay, the A values of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were 51 296.00\\xc2\\xb12 631.06, 68 389.25\\xc2\\xb16 703.21 and 65 559.50\\xc2\\xb16 339.22 at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The values of the viability of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were significantly lower than those of AGS-sictrl cells (P<0.001). The results of flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis rates of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were (1.42\\xc2\\xb10.07)%, (2.98\\xc2\\xb10.11)% and (1.56\\xc2\\xb10.03)% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of AGS-sictrl cells (all P<0.05). The distribution of S phase in AGS-siTRAF2 cells was (23.57\\xc2\\xb11.12)%, while that in the AGS-sictrl cells was (19.49\\xc2\\xb11.19)%. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). AGS-siTRAF2 cells migrated much slower than AGS-sictrl cells from 3 h and the number of migrated AGS-sictrl cells was 121.7\\xc2\\xb16.7 while that of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was 84.0\\xc2\\xb16.6 (P=0.002). The cell index of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was less than that of AGS-sictrl cells from 3 h. In Transwell assay, the number of invaded AGS-sictrl cells was 109.3\\xc2\\xb13.1 after 24 h of culture, significantly higher than 79.0\\xc2\\xb16.2 of AGS-siTRAF2 cells (P=0.002). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of RelA, RelB, p50 and p52 in AGS-siTRAF2 cells were significantly lower than those in AGS-sictrl cells. The activities of RelA, RelB, p50 and p52 in AGS-siTRAF2 cells were 0.01\\xc2\\xb10.00, 0.01\\xc2\\xb10.01, 0.92\\xc2\\xb10.01 and 0.53\\xc2\\xb10.03, respectively, significantly lower than those of AGS-sictrl cells (all P<0.001). High TRAF2 expression (TRAF2-high) was found in 53.0% of GC samples, while TRAF2-high was only observed in 38.0% of the paired adjacent tissues (P=0.033). The expression of TRAF2 was significantly higher in the tubular adenocarcinoma, poor differentiation advanced T, advanced N, and clinical staging (P<0.05). The median survival time were 17 months and 78 months in the TRAF2 high-expression and low-expression groups, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.010). Conclusions: Depletion of TRAF2 inhibits the AGS cell growth, migration and invasion. The expression of TRAF2 is increased in gastric tumor tissue. The expression of TRAF2 is associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer. labels: #Apoptosis#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Humans#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Signal Transduction#Stomach Neoplasms#TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2'
b'We report an investigation of microbially induced carbonate precipitation by seven indigenous bacteria isolated from a landfill in China. Bacterial strains were cultured in a medium supplemented with 25 mmol/L calcium chloride and 333 mmol/L urea. The experiments were carried out at 30 \\xc2\\xb0C for 7 days with agitation by a shaking table at 130 r/min. Scanning electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses showed variations in calcium carbonate polymorphs and mineral composition induced by all bacterial strains. The amount of carbonate precipitation was quantified by titration. The amount of carbonate precipitated in the medium varied among isolates, with the lowest being Bacillus aerius rawirorabr15 (LC092833) precipitating around 1.5 times more carbonate per unit volume than the abiotic (blank) solution. Pseudomonas nitroreducens szh_asesj15 (LC090854) was found to be the most efficient, precipitating 3.2 times more carbonate than the abiotic solution. Our results indicate that bacterial carbonate precipitation occurred through ureolysis and suggest that variations in carbonate crystal polymorphs and rates of precipitation were driven by strain-specific differences in urease expression and response to the alkaline environment. These results and the method applied provide benchmarking and screening data for assessing the bioremediation potential of indigenous bacteria for containment of contaminants in landfills. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'AIM: The colour stability of the silicone is essential for the longevity of facial prostheses. This in vitro study investigates the colour degradation of two different skin shade silicones moulded in Type II and Type III dental stone.METHODS & MATERIALS: Two different types of dental stone were used to fabricate 168 silicone samples (n=42 for each group) using M511 maxillofacial silicone, which was coloured with Spectromatch Procolourants. The polymerisation was carried out at 85\\xc2\\xb0C 1.5 hours. A spectrophotometer was used to record the colour differences (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85) of each group before and after polymerisation. The CIEL*a*b* formula was used to obtain the measurements and a one-way ANOVA was carried out for the statistical analysis of the data.RESULTS: There is a statistically significant colour difference (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85) for all groups. For the Afro-Caribbean skin tone, Type III dental stone demonstrated the greatest colour change (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 = 4.36), whereas, for the Caucasian skin tone, it was the Type II dental stone (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 = 2.21).CONCLUSION: This study showed that regardless of the investing material, the colour of the silicone lightens after polymerisation. Both types of dental stone resulted in visible colour changes, with a \\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 ranging from 1.64 - 4.36. labels: #Caribbean Region#Color#Materials Testing#Maxillofacial Prosthesis#Silicone Elastomers#Skin Pigmentation'
b'Objective: To investigate the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for selective fetal reduction in complex multiple pregnancies and analyze factors affecting perinatal outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective case series of 156 patients undergoing selective fetal reduction by RFA in Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University from July 22th, 2011 to September 12th, 2018. They were divided into five groups according to surgical indications, including 46 cases in the monochorionic twins discordant for fetal anomalies group, 42 cases in the multiple pregnancies for reducing fetal numbers group, 40 cases in the twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) group, 24 cases in the selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) group and 4 cases in the twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (TRAPS) group. According to the gestational age at surgery, patients were divided into two groups: the gestational age at surgery <20 weeks group (75 cases) and the gestational age at surgery?20 weeks group (81 cases). According to the cycles of RFA required for surgery, patients were divided into two groups: one cycle group (124 cases) and ?2 cycles group (32 cases). Basic information of patients, surgical process, postoperative complications and pregnancy outcomes were recorded. The growth and development of survival newborns were also followed up. Factors affecting perinatal outcomes were analyzed. Results: (1) The median gestational age at procedure of 156 patients was 20 weeks (14(+5)- 29(+1) weeks). The median cycles of RFA was 1 cycle (1-3 cycles), of which one cycle accounted for 79.5% (124/156). (2) Eleven (7.1%, 11/156) patients experienced intrauterine fetal death, 27 (17.3%, 27/156) patients miscarried, and the overall survival rate was 75.6% (118/156). Premature birth rate before 34 weeks was 19.5% (23/118). There were 129 neonates. The median gestational age at delivery was 37(+3) weeks (28(+2)- 41(+1) weeks) with a mean birth weight of (2 657\\xc2\\xb1700) g. (3) Analysis of pregnancy outcomes based on surgical indications found that, the gestational age at delivery [38 weeks (30(+1)-41(+1) weeks), 36(+4) weeks (29- 39 weeks), 36(+4) weeks (28(+2)-39(+5) weeks), 38 weeks (31-39(+6) weeks), 38(+3) weeks (30(+4)-38(+4) weeks)] and neonatal birth weight [(2 820\\xc2\\xb1671), (2 435\\xc2\\xb1416), (2 497\\xc2\\xb1843), (2 998\\xc2\\xb1718), (2 517\\xc2\\xb11 087) g] were significantly different among fetal anomalies group, reducing fetal numbers group, TTTS group, sIUGR group and TRAPS group, respectively (all P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the pregnancy outcomes between gestational age at surgery <20 weeks group and gestational age at surgery ?20 weeks group, or between one cycle group and ?2 cycles group, respectively (all P>0.05). Conclusions: RFA is a safe and effective procedure in treating complex monochorionic multiple pregnancies. Surgical indications would affect the gestational age at delivery and neonatal outcomes. labels: #Catheter Ablation#Delivery, Obstetric#Female#Fetofetal Transfusion#Gestational Age#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Outcome#Pregnancy Reduction, Multifetal#Pregnancy, Twin#Radiofrequency Ablation#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Twins, Monozygotic'
b'Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is the family of Ser/Thr protein kinases that has emerged as a highly selective with low toxic cancer therapy target. A multistage virtual screening method combined by SVM, protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (PLIF) pharmacophore and docking was utilised for screening the CDK2 inhibitors. The evaluation of the validation set indicated that this method can be used to screen large chemical databases because it has a high hit-rate and enrichment factor (80.1% and 332.83 respectively). Six compounds were screened out from NCI, Enamine and Pubchem database.

b"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) case-based surveillance (CBS) systematically and continuously collects available demographic and health event data (sentinel events*) about persons with HIV infection from diagnosis and, if available, throughout routine clinical care until death, to characterize HIV epidemics and guide program improvement (1,2). Surveillance signals such as high viral load, mortality, or recent HIV infection can be used for rapid public health action. To date, few standardized assessments have been conducted to describe HIV CBS systems globally (3,4). For this assessment, a survey was disseminated during May-July 2019 to all U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported countries with CDC presence\\xe2\\x80\\xa0 (46) to describe CBS implementation and identify facilitators and barriers. Among the 39 (85%) countries that responded,\\xc2\\xa7 20 (51%) have implemented CBS, 15 (38%) were planning implementation, and four (10%)\\xc2\\xb6 had no plans for implementation. All countries with CBS reported capturing information at the point of diagnosis, and 85% captured sentinel event data. The most common characteristic (75% of implementation countries) that facilitated implementation was using a health information system for CBS. Barriers to CBS implementation included lack of country policies/guidance on mandated reporting of HIV and on CBS, lack of unique identifiers to match and deduplicate patient-level data, and lack of data security standards. Although most surveyed countries reported implementing or planning for implementation of CBS, these barriers need to be addressed to implement effective HIV CBS that can inform the national response to the HIV epidemic. labels: #Developing Countries#Global Health#HIV Infections#Humans#International Cooperation#Population Surveillance#United States"
b'Three-dimensional structural scaffolds have played an important role in tissue engineering, especially broad applications in areas such as regenerative medicine. We have developed novel biodegradable porous poly(propylene fumarate)-co-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PPF-co-PLGA) scaffolds using thermally induced phase separation, and determined the effects of critical parameters such as copolymer concentration (6, 8, and 10 wt %) and the binary solvent ratio of dioxane:water (78/22, 80/20, 82/18 wt/wt %) on the fabrication process. The cloud-point temperatures of PPF-co-PLGA changed in parallel with increasing copolymer concentration, but inversely with increasing dioxane content. The compressive moduli of the scaffolds increased with greater weight composition and dioxane:water ratio. Scaffolds formed using high copolymer concentrations and solvent ratios exhibited preferable biomineralization. All samples showed biodegradation capability in both accelerated solution and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell toxicity testing indicated that the scaffolds had good biocompatibility with bone and nerve cells, which adhered well to the scaffolds. Variations in the copolymer concentration and solvent ratio exercised a remarkable influence on morphology, mechanical properties, biomineralization, and biodegradation, but not on the cell viability and adhesion of the cross-linked scaffolds. An 8 to 10 wt % solute concentration and 80/20 to 82/18 wt/wt dioxane:water ratio were the optimum parameters for scaffold fabrication. PPF-co-PLGA scaffolds thus possess several promising prospects for tissue engineering applications. \\xc2\\xa9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

b'\\n             Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the top 10 infectious diseases with highest mortality globally since the 1990s despite effective chemotherapy. Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography - nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania - has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30-50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis. More efforts need to be placed if we are to reduce the death toll by 90 % until 2030.\\n           labels: #Adult#Child#Diagnostic Tests, Routine#Humans#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tanzania#Tuberculosis'
b'The bivalve Pinctada margaritifera exhibits three main transplant phenotypes derived from the donor (from which a mantle graft tissue, the saibo, is excised), the recipient (into which the saibo is implanted with a nucleus, leading to the formation of a pearl sac "chimera") and the cultured pearls themselves. This first phenome study on the species derived from a large experimental graft. Transplant phenotype was assessed at three scales: 1) macro, pearl size, colour, grade, 2) micro, pearl surface microstructure, and 3) molecular, biomineralisation gene expression level in saibo and pearl sac tissues. From donor to pearl, the phenome revealed fine variations of quality traits dependent on the position on the mantle where the saibo was cut, whose variation could overlap with inter-individual donor phenotype differences. A single donor phenotype could therefore produce multiple pearl phenotypes at the scale of the saibo position, mirroring its original activity at the mantle position level and the colour and shape of the shell. This phenome study provides essential information on phenotypic trait architecture enabling us to explore and explain the main biological functions and pave the way for a phenomic project on P. margaritifera that could benefit the pearl industry. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Heart Failure in Africa Abstract. In Africa, mortality due to heart failure is twice as high as in other low- to middle-income countries and five times as high as in high-income countries. Arterial hypertension is by far the most common cause of heart failure, followed by cardiomyopathies and rheumatic heart diseases. At diagnosis, most patients suffer already from an advanced disease stage. Only a few patients are aware of arterial hypertension, and few are treated and have their hypertension well controlled. Only a minority of patients have a well-controlled hypertension. The neglect of chronic non-communicable diseases on the health agenda leads to poor awareness, poor diagnostic resources, preventions strategies and treatment options. International guidelines cannot be properly followed in these circumstances. Information at community level and in healthcare facilities is urgently needed as well as training of healthcare staff, implementation of improved diagnostics and treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure. labels: #Africa#Cardiomyopathies#Heart Failure#Humans#Hypertension#Rheumatic Heart Disease'
b'Objective: To investigate the changes of perioperative immune index in patients with breast cancer and its clinical significance. Methods: Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th1/Th2 ratio and regulatory T cells (Treg) were detected in peripheral blood of 103 patients with primary breast cancer and 116 patients with breast fibroma before surgery and on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day following operation. The relationship of changes in T lymphocyte subsets and clinicopathological characteristics, as well as tumor-free survival of breast cancer patients, was analyzed. Results: The levels of Th1 cells in breast cancer group on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day following operation were (12.20\\xc2\\xb10.45)%, (13.89\\xc2\\xb10.47)%, (14.04\\xc2\\xb10.49)%, which were significantly lower than those before operation [(15.82 + 0.51)%, all P<0.05 ]. Treg cells, however, with the number of (3.82\\xc2\\xb10.13)%, (3.25\\xc2\\xb10.11)%, (2.95 \\xc2\\xb10.11)%, were remarkably higher than those before operation [(2.53 \\xc2\\xb10.11)%, all P<0.05]. With respect to breast fibroma patients, there was no significant difference compared with those before operation of Th1 cells, Th2 cells and Treg cells (all P>0.05). The changes of Th1 cells were associated with the degree of differentiation, T stage, N stage, TNM stage, HER-2 status and Ki-67 (all P<0.05). Treg cells were related to T stage, N stage and HER-2 status (all P<0.05). Tumor-free survival in the Th1-cell-increasing group was significantly better than that in the Th1-cell-decreasing group (P=0.045), while cell-decreasing group of Treg showed the improved outcomes (P=0.012). Conclusions: The levels of Th1 cells and Treg cells are important indicators of cellular immune function in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, the perioperative changes of Th1 cells and Treg cells are associated with the size of tumors, pathological parameters, clinical stages and tumor-free survival outcomes. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Immunity, Cellular#T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory#Th1-Th2 Balance'
b'Biominerals serve as critical structures of living systems and play important roles in biochemical processes. Understanding their crystallization mechanisms is therefore central to many areas of biology, biogeoscience, and biochemistry. Some biominerals, such as bone and dentin, are hierarchical nanocomposite structures constructed by sequential addition of individual oriented nanocrystals. The driving forces that enable this oriented assembly are still poorly understood, with advances in understanding limited in part by the availability of techniques that can precisely measure the delicate interactions between nanocrystals as a function of their separation distance and mutual orientation. Here, we provide a comprehensive protocol for (i) fabricating oriented single-nanocrystal atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes using focused ion beam (FIB) milling and (ii) performing oriented nanocrystal interaction force measurements using dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS)-based AFM and environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM)-AFM techniques. We illustrate how to fabricate oriented nanocrystal force probes using commercial bulk crystals or nano/microcrystals of calcite, zinc oxide, and rutile. The typical protocol for fabricating one AFM crystal probe takes 2-3 h. In addition, we illustrate how to quantify the direction-specific interaction forces for a given pair of interacting oriented nanocrystal faces. The methods are fully transferrable to other minerals of interest, such as the apatites constituting bone minerals. This allows researchers across many fields to measure and understand particle-based crystallization processes. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"With the change of disease spectrum and the progress in the aging of society, chronic wound has gradually become one of the major diseases that threaten human health, and also one of the major economic burdens of family and society. According to the different etiology, the pathogenesis of chronic wound is different, including both systemic factors and local factors. The treatment of chronic wound is a multi-disciplinary integrated treatment process, including internal medicine treatment, surgical treatment, vascular interventional therapy, platelet-rich plasma treatment, and biological therapy, etc. Each treatment regimen has its own indications and pros and cons. To make a treatment regimen, a combination of a variety of options should be chosen according to the patient's wound conditions. The traditional chronic wound treatment mode is multi-disciplinary team (MDT) treatment mode, which requires the participation of surgeons from multiple departments such as intervention department, plastic surgery department, orthopedics department, etc., and it is also the mainstream mode for treating chronic wound in western countries. According to the domestic medical situation and the experience of our department, we put forward the integrated surgical wound treatment (ISWT) mode, that is to integrate multiple surgical techniques of wound treatment. Compared with the traditional MDT treatment mode, to apply the ISWT mode can make a more reasonable treatment plan, improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment, shorten the hospitalization period, and improve the diagnosis and treatment ability of the team. With the increasing incidence of chronic wound, the ISWT mode needs to be further explored and improved, and the team needs more specialized experts to join in. labels: #Humans#Surgical Wound"
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term prognosis of vesicoureteral reflux in children.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 138 children (218 ureters with reflux) who were diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux for the first time from November 2005 to March 2017 and received medical treatment and regular follow-up. According to the initial grade of reflux, the ureters with reflux were divided into a low-grade group (141 ureters, grade I-III) and a high-grade group (77 ureters, grade IV-V), and the two groups were compared in terms of clinical data and follow-up results.RESULTS: Among the 138 children, there were 82 boys and 56 girls. Their age ranged from 31 days to 10 years at the time of confirmed diagnosis, with a median age of 8 months. The follow-up time ranged from 8 months to 7 years, with a median follow-up time of 1.4 years. At the time of confirmed diagnosis, the high-grade group had significantly higher levels of urinary N-acetyl-\\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosaminidase, urinary microalbumin and urinary immunoglobulin G than the low-grade group (P<0.05). Among the 218 ureters with reflux, 132 (60.6%) achieved a reduction in the grade of reflux (among which 74 achieved complete disappearance of reflux), 43 had no change in the grade of reflux, and 43 had an increase in the grade of reflux. Compared with the high-grade group, the low-grade group had a significantly higher complete remission rate (41.1% vs 19.5%, P=0.001) and a significantly shorter time to complete remission of reflux (P=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Most children with vesicoureteral reflux can achieve a reduction in the grade of reflux or even complete disappearance of reflux during follow-up, and the children with low-grade reflux have better prognosis than those with high-grade reflux. labels: #Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Infant#Male#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Vesico-Ureteral Reflux'
b'The present study is aimed to clarify the utility of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and the additional value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).This retrospective study involved 38 patients with PDAC concomitant with IPMN and 114 patients (control) who were randomly selected from 320 patients with IPMN without PDAC and were matched with cases for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strength (1.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8aT/3.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8aT). Two radiologists reviewed the 2 MR image sets with relevant clinical information blinded, first MRCP alone and then combined MRI set including DWI. Diagnostic capability and interobserver agreement were assessed by using receiver operating characteristics curve (Az) analysis and weighted \\xc3\\xaa statistics.Az values for the 2 observers were 0.834 and 0.821 for MRCP alone and 0.964 and 0.926 for the combined MRI (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001 and P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), respectively. The sensitivity of MRCP alone was 61% (23/38), with both observers failing to diagnose PDACs located at the end of tail or away from the pancreatic duct. Meanwhile, with combined MRI, sensitivity was significantly increased for both observers (61% to 92%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002; 61% to 87%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.004). Moreover, the interobserver agreement was higher with combined MRI (\\xc3\\xaa\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.85) than MRCP alone (\\xc3\\xaa\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.59).MRCP and DWI might be a superior option with a higher diagnostic capability of PDAC concomitant with IPMN than MRCP alone, especially for tumors away from the pancreatic duct. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal#Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance#Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasms, Multiple Primary#Pancreatic Intraductal Neoplasms#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Retrospective Studies'
b"Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the predictive performances of anatomic staging system (AS) and prognostic staging system (PS) proposed in the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual in patients with pure mucinous breast cancer (PMBC). Methods: Clinicopathologic features and follow-up information were collected from a total of 3628 patients with PMBC. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were compared among patients in different stage groups. Likelihood ratio (LR) \\xc3\\xb7(2), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were used to evaluate the predictive performances of AS and PS in PMBC. Results: In PMBC, BCSS was associated with tumor size (P=0.002), lymph node status (P=0.002), grade(P=0.003), PR status(P=0.017)and the receipt of radiation. Compared to AS, 1326 patients (37.54%) underwent stage change after applying PS, with 6.50% upstaged and 37.04% downstaged. There were significant differences in BCSS among patients of different stages under the AS and PS (P<0.001). However, PS was not superior to AS in predicting prognosis (AS vs PS, LR \\xc3\\xb7(2): 16.41 vs 17.5; AIC: 357.44 vs 358.35; C-index, 0.72 vs 0.73, P=0.667). Conclusions: Both of AS and PS proposed in the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual were predictive factors in patients with PMBC. Compared with AS, the PS did not show superiority in prognosis prediction among patients with PMBC. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Humans#Likelihood Functions#Neoplasm Grading#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Survival Rate#United States"
b"OBJECTIVES: To assess the perceived facial changes in class II division 1, convex profile patients treated with functional followed by fixed orthodontic appliances.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 36 pairs of pre- and post-treatment photographs (frontal and profile, at rest) of 12 patients treated with activator, 12 with twin-block, and 12 controls with normal profiles, treated without functional appliances. All photographs were presented in pairs to 10 orthodontists, 10 patients, 10 parents, and 10 laypersons. Visual analog scale\\xc2\\xa0(VAS) ratings of changes in facial appearance were assessed.RESULTS: The patient groups were similar in sex distributions, age, and treatment duration. The different rater groups showed strong to excellent agreement. There were no significant differences among treatment groups (F\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.91; P\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.526; Wilks lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.93), raters (F\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x891.68; P\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.054; Wilks lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.83), and when testing the combined effect of treatment and rater on the results (F\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.72; P\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.866; Wilks lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.85). The raters detected slightly more positive changes in the activator and twin-block groups, compared to the control group, regarding the lower face and the lips, but these findings did not reach significance. Furthermore, their magnitude hardly exceeded 1/20th of the total VAS length.LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design.CONCLUSIONS: The perceived facial changes of convex profile patients treated with functional, followed by fixed orthodontic appliances, did not differ from those observed in normal profile patients, when full-face frontal and profile photos were simultaneously assessed. Consequently, professionals should be skeptical regarding the improvement of a patient's facial appearance when this treatment option is used. labels: #Cephalometry#Esthetics#Face#Humans#Lip#Malocclusion, Angle Class II#Orthodontic Appliances, Functional#Orthodontists#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached to the core proteins of proteoglycans exert multiple roles, such as enriching signal molecules and regulating the binding of ligands to the corresponding receptors. A newly identified kinase - family with sequence similarity 20 member B (FAM20B) - is essential for the formation of GAG chains. The FAM20B protein phosphorylates the initial xylose on the side chain of a serine residue in the protein. Although the GAG chains of proteoglycans are believed to be indispensable during craniofacial development, there are few reports on their exact functions in craniofacial organogenesis. In this study, by mating Wnt1-cre mice with Fam20b-floxed mice (Fam20bflox/flox), we created Wnt1-Cre;Fam20bflox/flox mice in which Fam20b is ablated in the neural crest-derived mesenchyme. The Wnt1-Cre;Fam20bflox/flox mice died immediately after birth because of complete cleft palates. In addition to cleft palate, Wnt1-Cre;Fam20bflox/flox mice also manifested tongue elevation, micrognathia, microcephaly, suture widening, and reduced mineralization in the calvaria, facial bones, and temporomandibular joint. These findings indicate that the proteoglycans formed through the catalysis of FAM20B are essential for the morphogenesis and mineralization of the craniofacial complex. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To explore the short-term efficacy and prognosis of palliative surgical treatment for malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) caused by peritoneal metastasis of colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) primary colorectal cancer; (2) massive peritoneal metastasis; (3)obstructive site located below Treitz ligament by imaging; (4) obstruction refractory to conservative treatment; (5) estimated rese survival time more than 2 months; (6) patients and their families had strong willingness for operation; (7) surgical treatment included stoma/bypass and debulking surgery. In accordance with the above criteria, clinicopathological data of 46 patients undergoing palliative surgery at Peking University Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, Unit III from January 2016 to October 2018 were retrospectively collected. Postoperative symptomatic relief rate, morbidity of complication within 30 days, complication classification (Clavien-Dindo classification), mortality and survival after operation were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate survival and Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors. Results: Among 46 patients, 30 were male and 16 were female with median age of 63 (19-87) years; 23 patients received stoma/bypass surgery (stoma/bypass group), and 23 cases received tumor debulking surgery (debulking group). The overall symptom relief rate was 76.1% (35/46), while symptom relief rate in the debulking group was 91.3% (21/23), which was significantly higher than 60.9% (14/23) in the stoma/bypass group (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=4.301, P=0.038). Postoperative complications occurred in 25 patients. The complication rate was 52.2% (12/23) in the debulking group and 56.5% (13/23) in the stoma/bypass group, without statistically significant difference (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.088, P=0.767). Morbidity of complication beyond grade III was 8.7% (2/23) and 13.0% (3/23) in the debulking group and stoma/bypass group respectively, without statistically significant difference (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.224, P=0.636). Four patients died within 30 days after operation, 2 (8.7%) in each group. Twenty-four patients underwent 1-8 cycles of chemotherapy \\xc2\\xb1 targeting therapy (regimens: CapeOX \\xc2\\xb1 Bevacizumab, FOLFOX/FOLFIRI \\xc2\\xb1 Bevacizumab/Cetuximab), including 10 cases in the stoma/bypass group and 14 cases in the debulking group. Two patients of debulking group received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy (50.6 Gy/22 f, with concurrent oral capecitabine). Till the last follow up of April 2019, 34 patients died (34/46, 73.9%) with a median overall survival time of 6.4 months, and the 6-month and 1-year survival rate was 54.5% and 29.2% respectively. The median survival time in the debulking group was significantly longer than that in the stoma/bypass group (11.5 months vs. 5.2 months, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=5.117, P=0.024). The median survival time of the 35 patients with symptomatic relief after operation was significant longer than that of 11 patients without relief (7.1 months vs 5.1 months, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.844, P=0.050). Multivariate analysis showed stoma/bypass surgery (HR=2.917, 95%CI:1.357-6.269, P=0.006) and greater omental metastasis (HR=4.060, 95%CI:1.419-11.617, P=0.009) were independent risk factors associated with prognosis of patients with MBO caused by peritoneal mCRC. Conclusions: For patients of MBO caused by peritoneal mCRC, tumor debulking surgery may achieve higher symptom relief rate and prolong survival. Greater omental metastasis indicates poor prognosis. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Colorectal Neoplasms#Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures#Female#Humans#Intestinal Obstruction#Male#Middle Aged#Omentum#Palliative Care#Peritoneal Neoplasms#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous, radiation-free registration of the teeth and the upper and lower jaw positions in relation to the extraoral soft tissue could improve treatment planning and documentation. The purpose of this study is to describe a workflow to solve this form of registration and surface acquisition with a mobile device.METHODS: Facial scans of ten healthy participants were taken using a blue-light LED 3D scanner (Artec\\xc2\\xae Space Spider; Artec\\xc2\\xae Group; Luxembourg). An impression of the maxillary dentoalveolar arch was taken simultaneously to the 3D photo using a modified impression tray with two different extraoral registration geometries (sphere vs. cross). Following, an impression of the mandibular dentoalveolar arch was taken once. Both impressions were scanned with the 3D scanner. All resulting standard tesselation language (.stl) files of the geometries were compared to the original, virtual .stl files and the root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated for each surface (Artec Studio 13 Professional ?\\xe2\\x80\\x8964; Artec\\xc2\\xae Group; Luxembourg) to determine which geometry serves as a better reference for intra-extraoral registration.RESULTS: The RMSE between the original geometries and the scanned counterfeits were statistically lower for spherical geometries (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.008). Once scanned and aligned, both geometries enabled an alignment of the intra- and extraoral scan. However, the spherical geometries showed virtually better results without significance (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.70).CONCLUSIONS: The presented study provides a radiation-free solution for simultaneous dentoalveolar correlations in relation to the extraoral soft tissue. Spherical geometries achieved more precise and easier intra-extraoral alignments using the applied mobile 3D scanner and workflow. labels: #Dental Impression Technique#Dental Models#Face#Imaging, Three-Dimensional#Maxilla#Photography'
b'Objective: To investigate the characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) of cervix, and improve the diagnostic accuracy of MDA. Methods: The imaging data of eight cases of MDA was retrospectively collected, including tumor size, tumor location, tumor components, signal characteristics, enhancement characteristics and invasive extent. Results: The maximum diameter of tumor was (4.36\\xc2\\xb11.46) cm. Six tumors were mixed solid and cystic and two were predominantly solid. Six were diffusion limited on diffusion-weighted imaging, and two were not diffusion limited. On multi-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced scan, the enhancement curve of solid components of the tumor showed a plateau-like pattern in three cases and a slow-rising pattern in five cases. Tumors were confined to the cervical canal in three cases, infiltrated to cervical stroma > 1/2 depth in seven cases, and ? 1/2 depth in one case. There were four cases of uterine invasion, four cases of vaginal fornix invasion, four cases of bilateral ovarian metastasis and one case of lymph node metastasis. Conclusions: Patients suffering from large amount of vaginal discharge had cervical lesions on MRI showing polycystic and solid component enhancement should be alert to MDA. Deep-seated cervical biopsy and even conization is conducive to early diagnosis, treatment and improvement of prognosis. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Cervix Uteri#Female#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Retrospective Studies#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b"Objective: To explore the clinical efficacy of lobulated transplantation of free anterolateral thigh perforator flap in repairing electric burn wounds of limbs. Methods: From August 2014 to April 2019, 19 patients with electric burns in the limbs were hospitalized in our unit, including 18 males and 1 female, aged 20-58 years. There were 37 wounds deep to bone. The area of wounds ranged from 3.0 cm?2.0 cm to 40.0 cm?8.0 cm. Multiple-perforator-based anterolateral thigh flap was designed and resected. Then the flap was lobulated taking the respective perforators of the lateral circumflex femoral artery as the axial vessels before being transplanted to the debrided wounds in the limbs. The blood vessel trunk or the perforator vessels of flap lobes were anastomosed with the respective vessels in the recipient sites. The wounds were repaired with respective lobes of the flap when repairing multiple wounds in one surgical procedure, whereas the lobes were spliced or staggered to cover the wound to fit the shape of wound when repairing a single irregular wound in one surgical procedure. For the limb with distal blood supply disorder, the blood supply branch of flap was used to reconstruct the blood supply. If necessary, an appropriate length of vein was taken for transplantation. The improvement of reconstructed blood supply was observed. The number of surgeries, the number of anterolateral thigh perforator flaps, the number and size of flap lobes, the number of anastomosed vessels in each surgery, the treatment of the donor sites, the length of each surgery, the postoperative complications and survival condition of flap lobes were recorded. The upper extremity function was evaluated with the Carroll's Upper Extremity Function Test Scale, and the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery was investigated with a 5-point Likert Scale during follow-up. Surgeries were divided into single wound group of repairing one wound at one time and multiple wounds group of repairing two or more wounds at one time. The number of anastomosed vessels in each surgery, the treatment of the donor sites, the length of each surgery, and the postoperative survival condition of the flap lobes were compared between the two groups. Surgeries were divided into early group of performing surgery within post burn day 7 and late group of performing surgery on post burn day 7 and beyond. The postoperative complications and survival condition of flap lobes, the evaluation score of upper limb function and the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery at the last follow-up were compared between the two groups. Data were processed with independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: The blood supply of 5 patients with distal hand or finger blood supply disorder recovered or improved significantly after vascular transplantation. A total of 46 lobes [(2.2\\xc2\\xb10.4) lobes per flap] were obtained from 21 anterolateral thigh perforator flaps in 19 patients with 21 surgeries. The area of flap lobes ranged from 4.0 cm?3.0 cm to 24.0 cm?13.0 cm. In each surgery, 2.0 (1.5, 3.0) arteries and 3.0 (2.0, 3.0) veins were anastomosed. Six donor sites were repaired by thin split-thickness scalp, and 15 donor sites were closed directly. The duration of each surgery was (8.9\\xc2\\xb11.7) h. After surgery, bleeding and hematoma occurred in 2 flap lobes and local infection occurred in 5 flap lobes, which were improved after management. Vascular crisis occurred in 4 flap lobes, and exploratory surgeries were performed, after which 2 lobes survived, while the other 2 lobes necrotized and were repaired by other methods. The rest flap lobes survived well. After each postoperative follow-up of 3 to 60 months, the flap covering areas of the limbs were well-recovered. At the last follow-up, the function evaluation score of 20 affected upper limbs was 85 (63, 90) points, and the score of patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery was (4.4\\xc2\\xb10.7) points. A total of 30 flap lobes were obtained in 14 surgeries and repaired 30 wounds respectively in multiple wounds group, and 16 flap lobes were obtained in 7 surgeries and were spliced to repair 7 large irregular wounds in single wound group. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of anastomosed artery or vein in each surgery, and the duration of each surgery between multiple wounds group and single wound group (Z=0.240, 0.081, t=0.180, P>0.05), and the condition of skin grafting in the donor sites and the postoperative survival of the flap lobes in multiple wounds group were similar to those in single wound group (P>0.05). A total of 22 flap lobes were obtained in 10 surgeries and repaired 18 wounds in early group, and 24 flap lobes were obtained in 11 surgeries and repaired 19 wounds in late group. The incidence of postoperative hematoma, infection, vascular crisis, and survival of flap lobes in early group were similar to those in late group (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery at the last follow-up between early group and late group (t=0.701, P>0.05). At the last follow-up, the function evaluation score of 9 upper limbs in early group was 90 (85, 97) points, significantly higher than 80 (40, 85) points of 11 upper limbs in late group (Z=2.431, P<0.05). Conclusions: Free lobulated anterolateral thigh perforator flap is suitable for simultaneous repair of multiple electric burn wounds of limbs, as well as the repair of a single large irregular wound. It has the clinical advantages of less damage to the donor site and good repair quality. The early flap transplantation is beneficial to improve the function of limbs with electric burns. labels: #Adult#Burns, Electric#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Perforator Flap#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Thigh#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult"
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features and prognosis of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) complicated by neonatal pulmonary hemorrhage (NPH) in neonates.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 45 neonates with MAS complicated by NPH who were admitted to the hospital from December 2015 to December 2018 (observation group). Ninety neonates with MAS who were hospitalized during the same period of time and had no pulmonary hemorrhage were enrolled as the control group. The two groups were compared in terms of clinical features and prognosis.RESULTS: The observation group had a significantly lower 1-minute Apgar score after birth than the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the observation group had significantly higher incidence rates of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, air leak syndrome and shock and a higher rate of use of pulmonary surfactant (P<0.05), as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein and oxygen index (OI) (P<0.01). In the early diagnosis of NPH, OI had a sensitivity of 80.0%, a specificity of 96.7%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.959 (95% confidence interval: 0.929-0.988, P<0.001) at the cut-off value of 10.05. For the children who were cured and discharged, the observation group had significantly longer duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen inhalation and length of hospital stay than the control group (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with MAS complicated by NPH tend to have a longer duration of ventilation and higher incidence rates of air leak syndrome and shock. OI may be used as an index for the early diagnosis of MAS complicated by NPH. labels: #Hemorrhage#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Meconium Aspiration Syndrome#Prognosis#Pulmonary Surfactants#Retrospective Studies'
b'Context: Five different activating PTH/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor (PTHR1) mutations have been reported as causes of Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC), a rare disorder characterized by severe growth plate abnormalities and PTH-independent hypercalcemia.Objectives: Assess the natural history of clinical and laboratory findings in 24 patients with JMC and characterize the disease-causing mutant receptors in vitro.Patients and Methods: The H223R mutation occurred in 18 patients. T410P, I458R and I458K each occurred in single cases; T410R was present in a father and his two sons. Laboratory records were analyzed individually and in aggregate.Results: Postnatal calcium levels were normal in most patients, but elevated between 0.15 and 10 years (11.8 \\xc2\\xb1 1.37 mg/dL) and tended to normalize in adults (10.0 \\xc2\\xb1 1.03 mg/dL). Mean phosphate levels were at the lower end of the age-specific normal ranges. Urinary calcium/creatinine (mg/mg) were consistently elevated (children, 0.80 \\xc2\\xb1 0.40; adults, 0.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.19). Adult heights were well below the 3rd percentile for all patients, except for those with the T410R mutation. Most patients with JMC had undergone orthopedic surgical procedures, most had nephrocalcinosis, and two had advanced chronic kidney disease. The five PTHR1 mutants showed varying degrees of constitutive and PTH-stimulated cAMP signaling activity when expressed in HEK293 reporter cells. The inverse agonist [L11,dW12,W23,Y36]PTHrP(7-36) reduced basal cAMP signaling for each PTHR1 mutant.Conclusions: Except for T410R, the other PTHR1 mutations were associated with indistinguishable mineral ion abnormalities and cause similarly severe growth impairment. Hypercalciuria persisted into adulthood. An inverse agonist ligand effectively reduced in vitro PTH-independent cAMP formation at all five PTHR1 mutants, suggesting a potential path toward therapy. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'The ability to encrust in order to secure and maintain growth on a substrate is a key competitive innovation in benthic metazoans. Here we describe the substrate growth dynamics, mode of biomineralization and possible affinity of Namapoikia rietoogensis, a large (up to 1 m), robustly skeletal, and modular Ediacaran metazoan which encrusted the walls of synsedimentary fissures within microbial-metazoan reefs. Namapoikia formed laminar or domal morphologies with an internal structure of open tubules and transverse elements, and had a very plastic, non-deterministic growth form which could encrust both fully lithified surfaces as well as living microbial substrates, the latter via modified skeletal holdfasts. Namapoikia shows complex growth interactions and substrate competition with contemporary living microbialites and thrombolites, including the production of plate-like dissepiments in response to microbial overgrowth which served to elevate soft tissue above the microbial surface. Namapoikia could also recover from partial mortality due to microbial fouling. We infer initial skeletal growth to have propagated via the rapid formation of an organic scaffold via a basal pinacoderm prior to calcification. This is likely an ancient mode of biomineralization with similarities to the living calcified demosponge Vaceletia. Namapoikia also shows inferred skeletal growth banding which, combined with its large size, implies notable individual longevity. In sum, Namapoikia was a large, relatively long-lived Ediacaran clonal skeletal metazoan that propagated via an organic scaffold prior to calcification, enabling rapid, effective and dynamic substrate occupation and competition in cryptic reef settings. The open tubular internal structure, highly flexible, non-deterministic skeletal organization, and inferred style of biomineralization of Namapoikia places probable affinity within total-group poriferans. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Osteoclasts are multinucleated, giant cells originating from myeloid hematopoetic stem cells. These are the only cells in nature which can resorb bone. Differentiation of mononucleated osteoclast progenitor cells requires stimulation with M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) for the cells to proliferate and survive and with RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) for differentiation along the osteoclastic lineage to cells which eventually fuse to the mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. Therefore, most hormones and cytokines stimulating osteoclastogenesis do so indirectly by regulating the expression in osteoblasts of RANKL and its inhibitory decoy receptor OPG. Antibodies neutralizing RANKL is a common therapy to inhibit excessive osteoclast formation in diseases such as osteoporosis and malignant tumors with skeletal metastasis. Mature osteoclasts resorb bone by stimulating acid release into the resorption lacunae, followed by proteolytic degradation of bone matrix proteins. Loss-of-function mutations of proteins involved in acidification and proteolysis cause osteopetrosis, a disease with sclerotic bone due to non-functional osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are important for a healthy skeleton by removing damaged bone during remodeling of the skeleton, but are also important for modeling of bone, calcium homeostasis and tooth eruption, and possibly also for glucose and fat metabolism. Loss of bone in inflammatory disease, metastasizing tumors and osteoporosis is due to increased RANKL expression and enhanced osteoclast formation. The present overview aims to summarize how osteoclasts are formed and resorb bone in health and disease. labels: #Bone Resorption#Humans#Membrane Glycoproteins#Osteoblasts#Osteoclasts#Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B'
b'At the beginning of 2009, the 38th principle of the Administrative Measures for Clinical Application of Medical Technology, issued by the former Ministry of Health, clearly pointed out that medical institutions should establish a hierarchical management system for surgery. Then the Trial of Administrative Measures for Surgical Classification of Medical Institutions was published and implemented in 2012, but the official introduction of surgical classification catalogue in the national level has not been seen. Therefore, the writing group of this expert consensus has organized numerous well-known experts and scholars in China, taking the three elements of the 38th principle of the Administrative Measures for Clinical Application of Medical Technology issued by the Ministry of Health--risk coefficient, complexity, and technical difficulty as the basic norm to grade scientifically through the four indicators of burn index, surgical area, surgical repair method, and anesthesia risk (each indicator with 4 grades and scores). The total score is then accumulated to divide four grades of operations. The Expert Consensus on Classification Evaluation Methods of Burn Surgery in China (2019 Version) is strategized together expecting to provide academic reference for the government departments to issue or further improve and perfect surgical classification catalogue in the national level as soon as possible, and lay a foundation for the stable development of burn discipline with the significance of national strategic reserve. labels: #Burns#China#Consensus#Humans#Practice Guidelines as Topic'
b'Many areas of the ocean are nutrient-poor yet support large microbial populations, leading to intense competition for and recycling of nutrients. Organic phosphonates are frequently found in marine waters, but require specialist enzymes for catabolism. Previous studies have shown that the genes that encode these enzymes in marine systems are under Pho regulon control and so are repressed by inorganic phosphate. This has led to the conclusion that phosphonates are recalcitrant in much of the ocean, where phosphorus is not limiting despite the degradative genes being common throughout the marine environment. Here we challenge this paradigm and show, for the first time, that bacteria isolated from marine samples have the ability to mineralise 2-aminoethylphosphonate, the most common biogenic marine aminophosphonate, via substrate-inducible gene regulation rather than via Pho-regulated metabolism. Substrate-inducible, Pho-independent 2-aminoethylphosphonate catabolism therefore represents a previously unrecognised component of the oceanic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To investigate the application value of motor unit number index (MUNIX) for diagnosis and assessment progress in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Method: Sixty healthy controls and 60 ALS patients in the clinic were enrolled from May 2017 to December 2018. The bilateral deltoid, abductor digiti minimi, quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior muscles of the subjects were detected by MUNIX method, and the negative peak amplitude of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of ulnar nerve, femoral nerve, peroneal nerve, axillary nerve in bilateral was collected. MUNIX and motor unit size index (MUSIX) of muscles were compared between ALS group and control group. The difference between the MUNIX abnormal rate of muscles and abnormal rate of the corresponding CMAP negative peak amplitude in ALS patients was further compared. Meanwhile, the correlation between the disease course of ALS patients and MUNIX and MUSIX was analyzed. Results: Compared with the control group, the MUNIX values of the deltoid, abductor digiti minimi, quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior decreased significantly (97\\xc2\\xb124 vs 183\\xc2\\xb138, 48\\xc2\\xb117 vs 191\\xc2\\xb139, 54\\xc2\\xb115 vs 159\\xc2\\xb122, 49\\xc2\\xb116 vs 147\\xc2\\xb125, all P<0.05). MUSIX values increased ((175\\xc2\\xb132) \\xc3\\xacV vs (47\\xc2\\xb115) \\xc3\\xacV, (189\\xc2\\xb134) \\xc3\\xacV vs (54\\xc2\\xb116) \\xc3\\xacV, (170\\xc2\\xb130) \\xc3\\xacV vs (49\\xc2\\xb113) \\xc3\\xacV, (190\\xc2\\xb1 36) \\xc3\\xacV vs (48\\xc2\\xb1 14) \\xc3\\xacV, all P<0.05)). In ALS patients, the abnormal rate of MUNIX was respectively 81%, 87%, 75% and 89%. The negative peak amplitude abnormal rate of corresponding neuralCMAP was 35%, 40%, 31% and 36%, respectively, with a significant difference (P<0.05). There was a negative correlation between MUNIX value and the course of disease in ALS patients (P<0.05), and a positive correlation between MUSIX value and the course of disease (P<0.05). Conclusion: The MUNIX technique exhibits the features of quantifying the proximal upper and lower limb muscles and assessing the loss of motor units in motor neuron degeneration. labels: #Action Potentials#Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis#Electromyography#Humans#Motor Neurons#Muscle, Skeletal#Peroneal Nerve'
b'OBJECTIVE: To select and identify the bacterium which highly produces protease and \\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosidase from 72 strains of Shuidouchi from Sichuan, and to provide evidence for further research on its nutritional value and fermentation strain exploiting.METHODS: Casein degradation test and pNPG chemical test were applied respectively to detect the capacity to produce protease and \\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosidase of each strain.

b'Spinner flask bioreactors have often been employed for bone tissue engineering. However, the reasons for their success in facilitating bone growth remain inconclusive. It was hypothesised that engineered bone tissue formation can be attributed to mechanical stimuli, which can be predicted in the tissue engineered construct. To test the hypothesis and draw conclusions as to how mechanical stimulation affects cell behaviour, a multi- disciplinary approach using cell culture experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the complex flow within the spinner flask and scaffold was employed. Micro-computed tomography and histology showed that statically cultured human bone marrow derived stromal cells on silk fibroin scaffolds did not form extracellular matrix (ECM) or deposit minerals. However, constructs cultured at 60 rpm resulted in ECM formation and mineralisation, mainly at the bottom of the scaffold (bottom: 78 \\xc2\\xb1 7 %, middle: 17 \\xc2\\xb1 5 %, top: 5 \\xc2\\xb1 2 % of total mineralised volume). Culturing at 300 rpm led to a more homogeneously distributed ECM (bottom: 40 \\xc2\\xb1 14 %, middle: 33 \\xc2\\xb1 1 %, top: 27 \\xc2\\xb1 14 % of total mineralised volume). These observations were in agreement (Pearson correlation coefficient: 97 %) with the computational simulations that predicted maximal scaffold mineralisation, based on wall shear stress stimulation, in the bottom at 60 rpm and in the main body at 300 rpm. Such combinations of CFD modelling and experimentation could advance our knowledge of the mechanical stimuli that cells experience in vitro and link them to biological responses. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"If the abdominal pedicled flaps are not well fixed after repair of deep electric burn wounds in hands, many problems such as poor blood supply may occur. In order to solve the above problems, we designed and manufactured the individualized low temperature thermoplastic plate combined with special abdominal band to fix abdominal pedicled flaps for repairing of 17 patients (12 males and 5 females, aged 2-35 years) with deep electric burn wounds in hands from February 2016 to August 2018, and achieved the desired results. The shoulder joint, elbow joint, and wrist joint were fixed by low temperature thermoplastic plate according to the 1/2 circumference of the patient's side chest and upper arm, and the braking of wrist joint and elbow joint was strengthened by special abdominal band. Application of the combined method of fixing abdominal pedicled flaps in repairing deep electric burn wounds in hands has high success rate of flap transplantation. It is simple to make and practical, and worthy of clinical promotion. labels: #Abdomen#Adolescent#Adult#Burns, Electric#Child#Child, Preschool#Cold Temperature#Female#Hand Injuries#Humans#Male#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Surgical Flaps#Wound Healing#Young Adult"
b"Objective: The aim of the current study is to compare the short-term clinical outcomes between Billroth-I reconstruction using an overlap method and delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG). Method: A retrospective cohort study was performed. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) Preoperative gastroscopy and CT confirmed that the tumor is located in the antrum of the stomach, and the biopsy suggested adenocarcinoma; (2) Chest, abdomen and pelvis enhanced CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis; (3) Preoperative gastric reconstruction CT or endoscopic ultrasonography suggested that the clinical stage of the tumor is stage I-III. (4) During the operation, the tumor position was confirmed to be located in the antrum of the stomach by nanocarbon injection or gastroscope; (5) Complete laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for distal gastrectomy, and the gastrointestinal reconstruction was performed by delta-shaped anastomosis or overlap anastomosis. And the following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) History of gastric surgery; (2) Patients who cannot tolerate laparoscopic surgery because of comorbidities. Finally, data on 43 consecutive patients who underwent TLDG with Billroth-I reconstruction between January 2016 and November 2018 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into those who underwent Billroth-I reconstruction using an overlap method (n=20) or using delta-shaped anastomosis (n=23). The demographic and clinical characteristics and perioperative data of the two groups were analyzed. Measurement data that conformed to the normal distribution were expressed as the mean \\xc2\\xb1 s, and differences between groups were compared using Student's t-test; comparisons between the counting data groups were performed using the \\xc3\\xb7(2) test or the continuously corrected \\xc3\\xb7(2) test. Results: The demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the delta-shaped group and the overlap group (P>0.05). There was no significant difference between groups regarding operation time [(185.9\\xc2\\xb122.8) minutes vs. (184.0\\xc2\\xb125.8) minutes, t=0.260, P=0.796], blood loss [(50.9\\xc2\\xb136.0) ml vs. (47.0\\xc2\\xb130.8) ml, t=0.375, P=0.709], number of stapler reloads used for anastomosis (5.1\\xc2\\xb10.3 vs. 5.2\\xc2\\xb10.6, t=-0.465, P=0.651), time to flatus [(3.3\\xc2\\xb10.9) days vs. (3.6\\xc2\\xb10.9) days, t=-1.067, P=0.292) and postoperative hospitalization [(8.8\\xc2\\xb13.1) days vs. (10.4\\xc2\\xb13.8) days,t=-1.494, P=0.143]. As for the delta-shaped group and the overlap group, the anastomotic leakage rate was 4.3% (1/23) and 0 (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000), respectively. The incidence of anastomotic bleeding was 4.3% (1/23) and 5.0% (1/20) (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000), while the incidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage was 4.3% (1/23) and 0 (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000). The incidence of gastric emptying disorders was 4.3% (1/23) and 30.0% (6/20), respectively (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.454, P=0.063). All complications were cured after conservative treatment or symptomatic treatment.

b'The nacreous layer of pearl oysters is one of the major biominerals of commercial and industrial interest. Jacalin-related lectins, including PPL3 isoforms, are known to regulate biomineralization of the Pteria penguin pearl shell, although the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The PPL3 crystal structures were determined partly by utilizing microgravity environments for 3 isoforms, namely, PPL3A, PPL3B, and PPL3C. The structures revealed a tail-to-tail dimer structure established by forming a unique inter-subunit disulfide bond at C-termini. The N-terminal residues were found in pyroglutamate form, and this was partly explained by the post-translational modification of PPL3 isoforms implied from the discrepancy between amino acid and gene sequences. The complex structures with trehalose and isomaltose indicated that the novel specificity originated from the unique \\xc3\\xa1-helix of PPL3 isoforms. Docking simulations of PPL3B to various calcite crystal faces suggested the edge of a \\xc3\\xa2-sheet and the carbohydrate-binding site rich in charged residues were the interface to the biomineral, and implied that the isoforms differed in calcite interactions. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Recently, the biomineralization of enzyme in metal-organic-framework (enzyme-MOF) composite have shown a great potential to increase enzymes stability without compromising their activity; hence, it is desirable for its applications in biosensing devices. Nonetheless, most of the enzyme-MOF research has been focusing on enzyme encapsulation in particle form, which limits its synthesis flexibility for practical applications because of its requirement for postsynthesis immobilization onto solid support. Therefore, to develop a diagnostic device out of the biomineralized enzyme, surface patterning and integration of microfluidic system offers many advantages. In this work, mussel-inspired polydopamine/polyethyleneimine (PDA/PEI) coating is employed to pattern enzyme-MOF in microfluidic channels and exploit the wettability gradient for "pumpless transportation" effect. As a proof of concept, we combine a cascade reaction of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzymes to detect glucose into a patterned zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) thin film on a flexible polymeric substrate. The results show that the ZIF-8/GOx&HRP in situ composites on PDA/PEI patterns have good acid and thermal stability compared with samples without ZIF-8. ZIF-8/GOx&HRP in situ shows high selectivity toward glucose, linear sensitivity of 0.00303 Abs/\\xc3\\xacM, and the limit of detection of 8 \\xc3\\xacM glucose concentration. An unexpected benefit of this approach is the ability of the ZIF-8 thin-film structure to provide a diffusion limiting effect for substrate influx, thus, producing high range of linear response range (8 \\xc3\\xacM to 5 mM of glucose). This work provides insights into the spatial location of the enzymes in MOF thin films and the potential of such patterning techniques for MOF-based biosensors using other types of biological elements such as antibodies and aptamers. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Mounting evidence suggests that TGF\\xc3\\xa2/BMP signaling pathway is most likely involved in shell biomineralization in molluscs, but the function of pathway receptors is poorly studied. Here, we cloned and identified two homologous BMP receptor genes, PfBMPR1B and PfBAMBI, from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. Real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that these genes were expressed in mantle edge and pallial, specifically located at the outer epithelia. Knockdown of PfBMPR1B by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly decreased the expression levels of matrix protein (MP) genes and induced the abnormal ultrastructure of prismatic and nacreous layers. Conversely, knockdown of PfBAMBI significantly increased the expression levels of a portion of MP genes and induced the overgrowth of nacreous layer crystals. In the RNAi and shell notching experiments, MP gene expressions were competitively regulated by PfBMPR1B and PfBAMBI. In addition, the receptor inhibitor LDN193189 reduced the expression levels of MP genes in mantle primary cells and larvae, and induced abnormal D-shaped shell formation during larval development. Collectively, these results clearly show that PfBMPR1B and PfBAMBI are involved in regulating shell biomineralization in P. fucata. Our study therefore provides the direct evidence that BMP receptors participate in mollusc biomineralization. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic metal that can affect human health and environmental safety. The purpose of this study was to research the removal of Cd from an environmental perspective. In this article, four highly urease-active strains (CZW-2, CZW-5, CZW-9 and CZW-12) were isolated from an abandoned mine and their phylogenetic trees were analyzed. The maximum enzyme activities, the mineralized precipitate and the removal rates of these strains were compared. The results showed that CZW-2 had the highest urease activity at 51.6 U/mL, and the removal rates of CZW-2, CZW-5, CZW-9 and CZW-12 after 120 h were 80.10%, 72.64%, 76.70% and 73.40%, with an initial concentration of Cd of 2 mM in the Cd precipitation experiments. XRD (X-ray diffractometer), EDS (Energy dispersive spectrometer) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis indicated that the mineralized precipitate was CdCO\\xe2\\x82\\x83. SEM (Scanning electron microscopy) analysis revealed that the diameter of the oval-shaped mineralized product ranked from 0.5 to 2 \\xc3\\xacm. These strains were used to remedy Cd-contaminated soil, and five different fractions of Cd were measured. Compared with the control, the results of spraying pre-cultured strains containing 2% urea to remove Cd from contaminated soils showed that the exchangeable fraction of Cd decreased by 53.30%, 27.78%, 42.54% and 53.80%, respectively, whereas the carbonate-bound fraction increased by 55.42%, 20.27%, 39.67% and 34.36%, respectively, after one month. These data show that these strains can effectively reduce the bioavailability and mobility of Cd in contaminated soils. The results indicate that biomineralization based on the decomposition of substrate urea can be applied to remedy heavy contaminated soil and water. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'BACKGROUND: The ideal ablation strategy and end point for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) have not been well founded. Defining periprocedural AF termination as the end point of catheter ablation is still controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the differences between periprocedural AF termination and non-termination in the long-term AF recurrence rate and postoperative complications.METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a systematic search of electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library from January 2008 to August 2019. The primary outcome was freedom from AF or any atrial arrhythmia without antiarrhythmic drugs at the long-term (?12 months) follow-up. The secondary outcome was overall postoperative complication rates. The risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled for these outcomes. A forest plot, fixed-effects model or random-effect model, Q test, I statistic, and Egger funnel plot were used in the statistical analysis.RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant difference was found in freedom from AF at the long-term follow-up between patients in whom AF termination was achieved and not achieved (RR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.93, 95% CI\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.78-1.09, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.36, I\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a69%). Patients with AF non-termination had a lower complication occurrence rate than those with AF termination (RR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.74, 95% CI\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.11-2.73, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02, I\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0%).CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that AF termination is not a reliable procedural end point during ablation of persistent AF. labels: #Atrial Fibrillation#Catheter Ablation#Humans#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Treatment Outcome'
b'Depressive disorder is one of the most widespread forms of mental disorders which lead to a significant public health concern, such as disability, suicide, and so on. Its etiology remains vague but it is believed that depressive disorder is a multifactorial disease which is induced by the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Thus, there is no clear and definite pathological theory could illustrate its mechanism independently until now, involving genetics, neuroimaging, neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine, and others. Comprehensive assessment to patients with depression is the starting point for a right diagnosis. History-taking of physical condition is as important as psychiatric interview and rational usage of scales would be beneficial for screening. There are many kinds of therapeutic measures for depressive patients nowadays, including general intervention, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and physical therapy. For now, anti-depressants used in clinical practice is almost monoamine-based drugs while much more progress have been made in developing new antidepressant medications, like prototypical N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, opioid agonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, and psychedelics. Once these novel drugs are proved to be practicable, it will create a historical evolution in the field of psychiatry. In addition, we advocate that measurement-based care (MBC) should run through the whole duration of treatment and goals of MBC in every stage are different. As brain projects in many countries are conducting in inspiring ways, we believe that our understanding about depressive disorder, of course, and other neuropsychiatric disorders will be better in the future. labels: #Antidepressive Agents#Depression#Depressive Disorder, Major#Humans#Psychotherapy'
b'Biomineralization means mineral formation under the influence of organisms. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) constitute an essential role of iron sulphide minerals precipitation. Their composition involves amorphous, non-stoichiometric or crystalline iron sulphides, weakly or strongly magnetic. Variation in environmental conditions can alter the reactive iron species within the mineral, potentially modifying their magnetic properties. Biogenic iron sulphide minerals can be used as heavy metals and toxic ions adsorbents in soil or water remediation. For these reasons, a series of laboratory-scale iron sulphide synthesis experiments with the aim to study the chemical composition, mineralogy and magnetic properties of iron sulphide precipitates were carried out using SRB under various cultivation mode and nutrient medium composition. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) showed formation of iron sulphides in all biogenic samples and iron phosphates in abiotic controls. Results of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) in biomineralized samples confirmed nanocrystalline greigite, mackinawite and sulphur alpha. Magnetic measurements showed that sample prepared by static cultivation without addition of fresh nutrient medium was the most magnetic, magnetic hysteresis of sample formed under semicontinuous mode without any nutrient supply was the lowest. Abiotic samples contained only vivianite and they did not prove any significant response to magnetic field. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'BACKGROUND: Matrix-regulated biomineralization involves the specific nucleation and growth of mineral phases within or upon preformed structured organic matrices. We hypothesized that there might be a general mechanism whereby anionic, phosphorylated mineral ion-binding proteins assist in specifically locating the mineral ions with respect to the mineralizing structural organic matrix. Here we extended these studies to invertebrate mineralization in Lytechinus variegatus (Lv) teeth.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tooth proteins were extracted and the phosphoproteins occluded in the mineral were enriched by passage through a ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein enrichment column, and subjected to MS/MS analysis. A Lv RNA-seq derived transcriptome database was generated. The MS/MS data found 25 proteins previously classified as "Predicted uncharacterized proteins" and many of the spicule matrix proteins. As these 25 proteins were also identified with the transcriptome analysis, and were thus no longer "hypothetical" but real proteins in the Lv tooth. Each protein was analyzed for the presence of a signal peptide, an acidic pI?4, and the ability to be phosphorylated.RESULTS: Four new Lv tooth specific Pro-Ala-rich proteins were found, representing a new class of proteins.CONCLUSION: The tooth is different from the spicules and other urchin skeletal elements in that only the tooth contains both "high" and "very high" magnesium calcite, [Ca(1-X) Mg(X) CO3], where X is the mole fraction of Mg. We speculate that our newly discovered proline-alanine rich proteins, also containing sequences of acidic amino acids, may be involved in the formation of high magnesium and very high magnesium calcite. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Mollusk biomineralization is a process controlled by a complex interplay of proteins, ions and external regulators. In spite of several studies, there is a lack of knowledge of who (molecules involved), how (mechanism) and why (evolution and adaptation) mollusk are designed as we know them. In this study, a shell matrix protein, N66, has been purified and characterized biochemically from the shell of Pteria sterna. Two protein bands with carbohydrates associated were separated with a molecular weight of ~60 and 64\\xe2\\x80\\xafkDa. It has carbonic anhydrase activity and it is able to form crystal polymorphs of calcium carbonate in vitro. The mRNA N66 was obtained from the mantle tissue of Pteria sterna and the deduced amino acid sequence contained a carbonic anhydrase (CA) domain and a Asn/Gly-rich domain (aa243-439). The CA domain contained three His residues acting as zinc ligands and the gate-keeper residues present in all \\xc3\\xa1-CAs (Glu166-Thr525), being thus similar to the human isoform hCAVII. Also, to test whether the posttranslational modifications present on the native N66 affects the CA activity and its crystallization capability in vitro, a recombinant N66 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and functionally characterized. Our results show that recombinant N66 has higher CA activity and produce larger size crystals in vitro than the native N66 protein, suggesting that intrinsic properties of the native N66, such as glycosylations and/or phosphorylations, might regulate its activity. labels: #Biomineralization'
b"Objective: To investigate the diagnosis and treatment for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) in China, and to explore the prognostic factors of ECF. Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted based on the Registration System of Chinese Gastrointestinal Fistula and Intra-Abdominal Infections to collect the clinical data of ECF patients from 54 medical centers in 22 provinces/municipalities from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The clinical data included patient gender, age, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, underlying diseases, primary diseases, direct causes of ECF, location and type of ECF, complications, treatment and outcomes. All medical records were carefully filled in by the attending physicians, and then re-examined by more than two specialists. The diagnosis of ECF was based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory/imaging findings and intraoperative exploration. Results: A total of 1521 patients with ECF were enrolled, including 1099 males and 422 females, with a median age of 55 years. The top three primary diseases of ECF were malignant tumors in 626 cases (41.2%, including 540 gastrointestinal tumors, accounting for 86.3% of malignant tumors), gastrointestinal ulcers and perforations in 202 cases (13.3%), and trauma in 157 cases (10.3%). The direct causes of ECF were mainly surgical operation in 1194 cases (78.5%), followed by trauma in 156 (10.3%), spontaneous fistula due to Crohn's disease in 92 (6.0%), radiation intestinal injury in 41 (2.7%), severe pancreatitis in 20 (1.3%), endoscopic treatment in 13 (0.9%) and 5 cases (0.3%) of unknown reasons. All the patients were divided into three groups: 1350 cases (88.7%) with simple ECF, 150 (9.9%) with multiple ECF, and 21 (1.4%) with combined internal fistula. Among the patients with simple ECF, 438 cases (28.8%) were jejuno-ileal fistula, 313 (20.6%) colon fistula, 170 (11.2%) rectal fistula, 111 (7.3%) duodenal fistula, 76 (5.0%) ileocecal fistula, 65 (4.3%) ileocolic anastomotic fistula, 55 (3.6%) duodenal stump fistula, 36 (2.4%) gastrointestinal anastomotic fistula, 36 (2.4%) esophagogastric/esophagojejunal anastomotic fistula, 29 (1.9%) gastric fistula and 21 (1.4%) cholangiopancreatiointestinal. Among all the simple ECF patients, 991 were tubular fistula and 359 were labial fistula. A total of 1146 patients finished the treatment, of whom 1061 (92.6%) were healed (586 by surgery and 475 self-healing) and 85 (7.4%) died. A total of 1043 patients (91.0%) received nutritional support therapy, and 77 (6.7%) received fistuloclysis. Infectious source control procedures were applied to 1042 patients, including 711 (62.0%) with active lavage and drainage and 331 (28.9%) with passive drainage. Among them, 841 patients (73.4%) underwent minimally invasive procedures of infectious source control (replacement of drainage tube through sinus tract, puncture drainage, etc.), 201 (17.5%) underwent laparotomy drainage, while 104 (9.1%) did not undergo any drainage measures. A total of 610 patients (53.2%) received definitive operation, 24 patients died within postoperative 30-day with mortality of 3.9% (24/610), 69 (11.3%) developed surgical site infection (SSI), and 24 (3.9%) had a relapse of fistula. The highest cure rate was achieved in ileocecal fistula (100%), followed by rectal fistula (96.2%, 128/133) and duodenal stump fistula (95.7%,44/46). The highest mortality was found in combined internal fistula (3/12) and no death in ileocecal fistula. Univariate prognostic analysis showed that primary diseases as Crohn's disease (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=6.570, P=0.010) and appendicitis/appendiceal abscess (P=0.012), intestinal fistula combining with internal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=5.460, P=0.019), multiple ECF (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=7.135, P=0.008), esophagogastric / esophagojejunal anastomotic fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.501, P=0.002), ECF at ileocecal junction (P=0.012), non-drainage/passive drainage before the diagnosis of intestinal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.688, P=0.008), non-drainage/passive drainage after the diagnosis of intestinal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.711, P=0.008), complicating with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=179.699, P<0.001), sepsis (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=211.851, P<0.001), hemorrhage (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=85.300, P<0.001), pulmonary infection (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=60.096, P<0.001), catheter-associated infection (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=10.617, P=0.001) and malnutrition (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=21.199, P<0.001) were associated with mortality. Multivariate prognostic analysis cofirmed that sepsis (OR=7.103, 95%CI:3.694-13.657, P<0.001), complicating with MODS (OR=5.018, 95%CI:2.170-11.604, P<0.001), and hemorrhage (OR=4.703, 95%CI: 2.300-9.618, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of the death for ECF patients. Meanwhile, active lavage and drainage after the definite ECF diagnosis was the protective factor (OR=0.223, 95%CI: 0.067-0.745, P=0.015). Conclusions: The overall mortality of ECF is still high. Surgical operation is the most common cause of ECF. Complications e.g. sepsis, MODS, hemorrhage, and catheter-associated infection, are the main causes of death. Active lavage and drainage is important to improve the prognosis of ECF. labels: #China#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intestinal Fistula#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Prospective Studies#Risk Factors"
b'This article reports the clinical features and C12orf65 gene mutations of a girl with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-55. The 8-year-old girl experienced disease onset at the age of 5 years and had optic atrophy as the main clinical manifestation, with slow movements in standing up and a slight duck-shaped gait. Peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from this child and her parents and brother to perform high-throughput whole-exome sequencing and high-throughput mitochondrial genome sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed for verification. The results showed two compound heterozygous mutations, c.394C>T and c.447_449delGGAinsGT, in the C12orf65 gene. The former mutation came from her father and was a known pathogenic mutation, and the latter came from her mother and was a novel mutation which had not been reported in literature. This study expands the mutation spectrum of the C12orf65 gene and thus provides a molecular basis for the etiological diagnosis of the child and the genetic counseling of the family. labels: #Child#Female#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Male#Mitochondrial Proteins#Mutation#Pedigree#Peptide Termination Factors#Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary'
b"Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for chronic radiation intestinal injury. Methods: A descriptive cohort study was performed. Clinical data of 73 patients with definite radiation history and diagnosed clinically as chronic radiation intestinal injury, undergoing operation at Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 1, 2012 to February 28, 2019, were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Patients did not undergo operation or only received adhesiolysis were excluded. All the patients had preoperative examination and overall evaluation of the disease. According to severity of intestinal obstruction and patients' diet, corresponding nutritional support and conservative treatment were given. Surgical methods: The one-stage bowel resection and anastomosis was the first choice for surgical treatment of chronic radiation intestinal injury. Patients with poor nutritional condition were given enterostomy and postoperative enteral nutrition and second-stage stoma closure and intestinal anastomosis if nutritional condition improved. For those who were unable to perform stoma closure, a permanent stoma should be performed. Patients with severe abdominal adhesion which was difficult to separate, enterostomy or bypass surgery after adhesiolysis would be the surgical choice. For patients with tumor metastasis or recurrence, enterostomy or bypass surgery should be selected. Observation parameters: the overall and major (Clavien-Dindo grades III to V) postoperative complication within 30 days after surgery or during hospitalization; mortality within postoperative 30 days; postoperative hospital stay; time to postoperative recovery of enteral nutrition; time to removal of drainage tube. Results: Of the 73 patients who had been enrolled in this study, 10 were male and 63 were female with median age of 54 (range, 34-80) years. Preoperative evaluation showed that 61 patients had intestinal stenosis, 63 had intestinal obstruction, 11 had intestinal perforation, 20 had intestinal fistula, 3 had intestinal bleeding, and 6 had abdominal abscess, of whom 64(87.7%) patients had multiple complications. Tumor recurrence or metastasis was found in 15 patients. A total of 65(89.0%) patients received preoperative nutritional support, of whom 35 received total parenteral nutrition and 30 received partial parenteral nutrition. The median preoperative nutritional support duration was 8.5 (range, 6.0-16.2) days. The rate of one-stage intestine resection was 69.9% (51/73), and one-stage enterostomy was 23.3% (17/73). In the 51 patients undergoing bowel resection, the average length of resected bowel was (50.3\\xc2\\xb149.1) cm. Among the 45 patients with intestinal anastomosis, 4 underwent manual anastomosis and 41 underwent stapled anastomosis; 36 underwent side-to-side anastomosis, 5 underwent end-to-side anastomosis, and 4 underwent end-to-end anastomosis. Eighty postoperative complications occurred in 39 patients and the overall postoperative complication rate was 53.4% (39/73), including 39 moderate to severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-V) in 20 patients (27.4%, 20/73) and postoperative anastomotic leakage in 2 patients (2.7%, 2/73). The mortality within postoperative 30 days was 2.7% (2/73); both patients died of abdominal infection, septic shock, and multiple organ failure caused by anastomotic leakage. The median postoperative hospital stay was 13 (11, 23) days, the postoperative enteral nutrition time was (7.2\\xc2\\xb16.9) days and the postoperative drainage tube removal time was (6.3\\xc2\\xb14.2) days. Conclusions: Surgical treatment, especially one-stage anastomosis, is safe and feasible for chronic radiation intestine injury. Defining the extent of bowel resection, rational selection of the anatomic position of the anastomosis and perioperative nutritional support treatment are the key to reduce postoperative complications. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Anastomosis, Surgical#Anastomotic Leak#Chronic Disease#Enterostomy#Female#Humans#Intestinal Diseases#Intestines#Male#Middle Aged#Nutrition Assessment#Nutritional Status#Radiation Injuries#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'Objective: To investigate the expression of LC3B, p-AMPK\\xc3\\xa1 and p27 in cortical tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Methods: Nineteen specimens of surgically resected TSC cortical tubers were collected at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, from 2014 to 2017. The expression of the three proteins in the lesions and the adjacent relatively normal regions was detected by immunohistochemical staining (EnVision two-step method). Results: LC3B was mainly expressed in the dysmorphic neuron and giant cell in TSC cortical tubers and in the adjacent relatively normal neurons, and the expression was diffuse or perinuclear cytoplasmic. There was no significant difference in the average optical density between abnormal cells and neurons adjacent to the lesions (0.343\\xc2\\xb10.195 vs. 0.419\\xc2\\xb10.088, P>0.05). p-AMPK\\xc3\\xa1 was localized in the cytoplasm of dysmorphic neurons and giant cell in TSC cortical tubers. The average optical density of abnormal cells in the lesions was significantly higher than that of neurons adjacent to the lesions (0.306\\xc2\\xb10.123 vs. 0.233\\xc2\\xb10.654, P<0.05). P27 showed nuclear positivity, mainly expressed in the neurons and glial cells close to TSC cortical tubers, while the positive rate in the abnormal cells in TSC cortical tubers was low (15/19 vs. 7/19, P<0.05). Conclusion: There is no significant decrease in the level of autophagy in dysmorphic neurons and giant cells in TSC cortical tubers, which may be related to the compensatory mechanism of AMPK signaling pathway, but without activation of downstream p27. labels: #Autophagy-Related Proteins#Cerebral Cortex#Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27#Humans#Microtubule-Associated Proteins#Neuroglia#Neurons#Protein Kinases#Tuberous Sclerosis'
b'The potential of electrospun polydioxanone (PDX) mats as scaffolds for skeletal tissue regeneration was significantly enhanced through improvement of the cell-mediated biomimetic mineralization and multicellular response. This was achieved by blending PDX ( i) with poly(hydroxybutyrate- co-valerate) (PHBV) in the presence of hydroxyapatite (HA) and ( ii) with aloe vera (AV) extract containing a mixture of acemannan/glucomannan. In an exhaustive study, the behavior of the most relevant cell lines involved in the skeletal tissue healing cascade, i.e. fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells and preosteoblasts, on the scaffolds was investigated. The scaffolds were shown to be nontoxic, to exhibit insignificant inflammatory responses in macrophages, and to be degradable by macrophage-secreted enzymes. As a result of different phase separation in PDX/PHBV/HA and PDX/AV blend mats, cells interacted differentially. Presumably due to varying tension states of cell-matrix interactions, thinner microtubules and significantly more cell adhesion sites and filopodia were formed on PDX/AV compared to PDX/PHBV/HA. While PDX/PHBV/HA supported micrometer-sized spherical particles, nanosized rod-like HA was observed to nucleate and grow on PDX/AV fibers, allowing the mineralized PDX/AV scaffold to retain its porosity over a longer time for cellular infiltration. Finally, PDX/AV exhibited better in vivo biocompatibility compared to PDX/PHBV/HA, as indicated by the reduced fibrous capsule thickness and enhanced blood vessel formation. Overall, PDX/AV blend mats showed a significantly enhanced potential for skeletal tissue regeneration compared to the already promising PDX/PHBV/HA blends. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Artificial bio-based scaffolds offer broad applications in bioinspired chemistry, nanomedicine, and material science. One current challenge is to understand how the programmed self-assembly of biomolecules at the nanometre level can dictate the emergence of new functional properties at the mesoscopic scale. Here we report a general approach to design genetically encoded protein-based scaffolds with modular biochemical and magnetic functions. By combining chemically induced dimerization strategies and biomineralisation, we engineered ferritin nanocages to nucleate and manipulate microtubule structures upon magnetic actuation. Triggering the self-assembly of engineered ferritins into micrometric scaffolds mimics the function of centrosomes, the microtubule organizing centres of cells, and provides unique magnetic and self-organizing properties. We anticipate that our approach could be transposed to control various biological processes and extend to broader applications in biotechnology or material chemistry. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'At the Ediacaran/Cambrian boundary, ecosystems witnessed an unparalleled biological innovation: the appearance of shelled animals. Here, we report new paleoecological and paleobiological data on Cloudina, which was one of the most abundant shelled animals at the end of the Ediacaran. We report the close association of Cloudina tubes with microbial mat textures as well as organic-rich material, syndepositional calcite and goethite cement between their flanges, thus reinforcing the awareness of metazoan/microorganism interactions at the end of the Ediacaran. The preservation of in situ tubes suggests a great plasticity of substrate utilization, with evidence of different life modes and avoidance behavior. Geochemical analysis revealed walls composed of two secondary laminae and organic sheets. Some walls presented boreholes that are here described as predation marks. Taken together, these data add further information regarding the structuring of shelled animal communities in marine ecosystems. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in the cognitive function and hippocampal ultrastructure of elderly rats exposed to sevoflurane.METHODS: Ault male Sprague-Dawley rats were given subcutaneous injection of D-galactose on the neck for 40 d to establish elderly models, after 9-day behavioral training. The model rats were divided into 3 groups randomly: control group with natural air, A/O group with 6 h exposure to carrier gas (2 L/min Air+2 L/min O2), and Sev group with 6 h exposure to 3.2% sevoflurane through carrier gas. Morris Water Maze and balance beam experiment were conducted on 6 rats in each group 2 h, 1 week and 4 weeks after treatments, respectively. The hippocampal tissues of the rats were rapidly dissected and prepared by glutaraldehyde fixation, ethanol dehydration, infiltration, embedding polymerization, semimembrane section localization and staining for examinations under transmission electron microscopy. The hippocampal ultrastructure such as nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, medullary nerve fiber, synapse and apoptotic corpuscle were observed.RESULTS: Ethology: compared with the control and A/O groups, significant reductions in the probe trial capability were found in the rats after 2 h exposure to sevoflurane, which recovered at 1 week and 4 weeks. Sevoflurane also increased the working memory escape latency 2 h and 1 week after exposure. The balance beam experiment showed that sevoflurane prolonged the staring time of rats after 2 h exposure, which recovered at 1 week and 4 weeks. Prolonged length for going through the balance beam was found consistently in the rats exposed to sevoflurane. Transmission electron microscopy: rats in the control group were found to have clear hippocampal ultrastructure, intact nuclear membrane, no edema fluid in the cytoplasm, intact mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, normal medullary nerve fibers, intact synaptic structure, and no apoptotic bodies in the cells. But a small amount of edema were observed in the cytoplasm of hippocampal cells in the rats exposed to sevoflurane and A/O at 2 h, which increased at 1 week. The cytoplasmic morphology of rats in the A/O group returned to normal at 4 weeks. But further increase of edema was observed in the rats 4 weeks after exposure to sevoflurane. No abnormal morphological structures or apoptotic bodies in other organelles were found.CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane can induce early neurocognitive impairments in elderly rats, which may be related with changes in the hippocampus ultrastructure. labels: #Aging#Animals#Cognition#Hippocampus#Male#Maze Learning#Random Allocation#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Sevoflurane'
b'In this work, we have explored the polysaccharide nature of bael fruit gum (BFG) motivated from the current findings about the substantial role of the polysaccharides in bone tissue engineering. The nanocomposite scaffold (CSH-BFG) was prepared by blending BFG, nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) and chitosan (CS) by co-precipitation approach and compared with n-HA and CS binary system (CSH). The analysis of different properties was carried out by SEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD and mechanical testing. The CSH-BFG scaffolds revealed a rough morphology and uniform distribution of particles along with strong chemical interactions among different components compared to the CSH scaffold. The incorporation of BFG in the scaffold resulted in significant increase of the compressive strength, compressive modulus, protein adsorption, biodegradation and swelling behaviour. The ternary system exhibited superior antibacterial activity against different bacterial pathogens compared to the binary system. The in vitro biomineralization ability was elucidated from the formation of thick apatite layer complementing the result of ARS study in the CSH-BFG nanocomposite. Our findings also revealed that BFG reinforced CSH nanocomposite exhibited enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation, osteogenic differentiation along with phenomenal cytocompatibility. Overall, our results signified that the fabricated CSH-BFG nanocomposite carries enormous potential to be applied in the bone remodelling procedures. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of different courses of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention on recognition memory and the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells in mice with radiation-induced brain injury, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improving radiation-induced brain injury.METHODS: Se-venty 30-day old C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups, and the latter two groups were further divided into 1 week (W), 2 W and 3 W subgroups (n=10 in the control group and each subgroup). The ra-diation-induced brain injury model was established by radiating the mouse\\\' left head at a dose of 8 Gy for 10 min by using a radiation linear accelerator. EA (1.5 V, 2 Hz/10 Hz) was applied to "Baihui" (GV20), "Fengfu" (GV14) and bilateral "Shenshu" (BL23) for 30 min, once daily for 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. The learning-cognition memory ability was detected by using novel object recognition test in an open test box to record the time for exploring a novel object (TN) and a familiar object and to calculate the recognition index (RI). The neural stem cells\\\' proliferation and differentiation in the hippocampus tissues were evaluated by counting the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells, neuronal nuclei (NeuN)/BrdU-positive cells and BrdU/glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells under microscope after immunofluorescence stain.RESULTS: After modeling, the TN at 90 min and 24 h and RI of the model subgroup 3 W at 90 min and RI of the model subgroup 1, 2 and 3 W at 24 h were significantly decreased in comparison with those of the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). Moreover, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the model subgroup 1 W and 2 W, the BrdU/NeuN double-labeled cells in the 3 model subgroups and BrdU/GFAP double-labeled cells in the model subgroup 1 W and 3 W were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05). Following EA interventions, the TN in the 3 EA subgroups at both 90 min and 24 h, and RI of EA subgroup 3 W at 90 min and EA subgroup 2 W and 3 W at 24 h were considerably increased compared with those of the corresponding 3 model subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The numbers of BrdU-positive cells as well as BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP double-labeled cells were significantly increased in the 3 EA subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001).CONCLUSION: EA of GV20, GV14 and BL23 can improve the recognition memory ability of mice with radiation-induced brain injury, which may be related to its effect in promoting the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the hippocampus. labels: #Animals#Brain Injuries#Cell Differentiation#Cell Proliferation#Electroacupuncture#Hippocampus#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Neural Stem Cells'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mitochondrial translocation of hypoxia inducible factor-3\\xc3\\xa1 (HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1) under normoxia and hypoxia and its physiological and pathological meanings.METHODS: ? After hypoxic (1%O2) or DMOG, CoCl2 treatments mimicking the hypoxic treatment, Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to examine the HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 expression in mitochondria of HeLa and ACHN cells, respectively. ?The protease sensitivity experiment was used to explore the sub-organelle localization of HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 in mitochondria. ?Western blot was used to examine mitochondrial HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 in the normal mouse tissues and human liver carcinoma tissues.RESULTS: ?

b"The pancrustacean theory groups crustaceans and hexapods (once thought to comprise separate clades within the Arthropoda) into a single clade. A key feature common to all pancrustaceans is their chitinous exoskeleton, with a major contribution by cuticular proteins. Among these, are the CPAP3's, a family of cuticular proteins, first identified in the hexapod Drosophila melanogaster and characterized by an N-terminal signaling peptide and three chitin-binding domains. In this study, CPAP3 proteins were mined from a transcriptomic library of a decapod crustacean, the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. Phylogenetic analysis of other CPAP3 proteins from hexapods and other crustaceans showed a high degree of conservation. Characterization of the crayfish proteins, designated CqCPAP3's, suggested a major role for CPAP3'sin cuticle formation. Loss-of-function experiments using RNAi supported such a notion by demonstrating crucial roles for several CqCPAP3 proteins during molting. A putative mode of action for the CqCPAP3 proteins -theoretically binding three chitin strands- was suggested by the structural data obtained from a representative recombinant CqCPAP3. The similarities between the CqCPAP3 proteins and their hexapod homologues further demonstrated common genetic and proteinaceous features of cuticle formation in pancrustaceans, thereby reinforcing the linkage between these two highly important phylogenetic groups. labels: #Biomineralization"
b'BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, which seriously affects human health. Gramicidin is a short peptide antibiotic which could be used for treating infection induced by bacteria or fungi. However, the anti-cancer effect of gramicidin on gastric cancer cells and its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.RESULTS: Gastric cancer cells SGC-7901, BGC-823 and normal gastric mucosal cells GES-1 were treated with different concentrations of gramicidin respectively. The results of CCK-8 experiment revealed cellular toxicity of gramicidin to cancer cells while cell colony formation assay showed that gramicidin significantly inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, but had little effect on normal gastric mucosal cells. In addition, the wound healing assay showed that gramicidin inhibited the migration of SGC-7901 cell. Meanwhile, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis revealed that gramicidin induced cell apoptosis with G2/M cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that gramicidin down-regulated the expression of cyclinD1 and Bcl-2 as well as the FoxO1 phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: The current study illustrated the anti-tumor activity of gramicidin on gastric cancer cells, providing a possibility for gramicidin to be applied in clinical practice for the treatment of gastric cancer. labels: #Apoptosis#Cell Cycle#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Cyclin D1#Down-Regulation#Forkhead Box Protein O1#Gramicidin#Humans#Phosphorylation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2#Stomach Neoplasms'
b'The present study aimed to investigate the safety and short-term outcome of laparoscopy-assisted distal radical gastrectomy in treating gastric cancer among obese patients.Perioperative outcomes were compared between 67 gastric cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) ?25\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m (obese group) and 198 ones with BMI <25\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m (non-obese group). All the cases underwent laparoscopic radical resection between April 2009 and October 2013.The value of BMI was 27.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.67\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m in the obese group and 21.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.64\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m in non-obese group. There were no significant differences between 2 groups in age, sex, presence of diabetes, tumor size, number of metastatic lymph nodes, or metastatic lymph node ratio. Postoperative complications did not differ between the 2 groups (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05).

b'Testosterone (T) has been suggested as a promising agent in the bone osteointegration when incorporated in a bioceramic/polymer combination for the local application. The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of a testosterone composite of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) as a strategy for enhancing its osteogenic effect and to evaluate tissue response to the composite implantation. PLGA/PCL/BCP/T and PLGA/PCL/BCP composites were prepared and characterized using thermal analysis. Composite morphology and surface characteristics were assessed by SEM and EDS. The evaluations of in vitro effects of testosterone composite on osteoblasts viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen production, osteocalcin concentration, quantification of mineralization, and nitric oxide concentration, after 7, 14, and 21\\xc2\\xa0days. Testosterone was successfully incorporated and composites showed a homogeneously distributed porous structure. The PLGA/PCL/BCP/T composite had a stimulatory effect on osteoblastic activity on the parameters evaluated, except to nitric oxide production. After 60\\xc2\\xa0days, the PLGA/PCL/BCP/T composite showed no chronic inflammatory infiltrate, whereas the PLGA/PCL/BCP composite showed mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Angiogenesis, cellular adsorption, and fibrous deposit were observed on the surfaces of implanted composites. The composites in combination with testosterone can be exploited to investigate the use of this scaffold for bone integration. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of adult rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients. Methods: The clinical data of 34 adult RMS patients were retrospectively analyzed. Based on their intervention and treatment, patients were divided into operation group (n=7), chemotherapy group (n=8) and operation plus chemotherapy group (n=19). The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of the three groups were compared. Results: A statically significant difference was found in IRSG surgical-pathological stage among the three groups (P=0.026), while no significant difference existed in gender, age of disease onset, primary site, tumor size, pathological subtypes and IRSG risk group in the three groups (all P>0.05). In the operation group, three CR, one PR, one SD and two PD were achieved and one CR, one PR, one SD and five PD were obtained in the chemotherapy group. While in the chemotherapy plus operation group, four CR, twelve PR, one SD and two PD were achieved. A significant difference was found in response (P=0.043) and median overall survival (OS) (P=0.036) among the three groups, which were 44.7, 26.9 and 53.6 months, respectively. Conclusions: Pleomorphic RMS was the main histological subtype for adult RMS patients, and the prognosis for adult RMS was usually poorer than that for pediatric RMS patients. Single therapeutic approach could not achieve satisfactory outcomes, while multimodal treatment consisted of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are helpful to improve the prognosis of adult patients with RMS. labels: #Adult#Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Combined Modality Therapy#Humans#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Rhabdomyosarcoma#Treatment Outcome'
b'Fusulinids are the most diverse, abundant and geographically widespread Paleozoic foraminifera which are widely considered to possess a "homogeneously microgranular" test microstructure composed of subangular grains of several micrometers in size. However, this texture appears to be a diagenetic artifact. Here we describe well-preserved Devonian calcareous fusulinids (Nanicella) from the Holy Cross Mountains (HCM) in central Poland. Foraminifera from Poland in which the primary nature of tests have not been masked by diagenesis are composed of low magnesium calcite spherical grains up to about 100 nanometers in diameter, identical to those observed in Recent and fossil hyaline foraminifera (Rotaliida, Globothalamea). These data call the paradigm of microgranular test microstructure of Foraminifera into question, and suggest a possible phylogenetic relationship between globothalamids and some fusulinids. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 152 children with neonatal bacterial meningitis. According to their prognosis, they were divided into a good prognosis group with 122 children and a poor prognosis group with 30 children. The two groups were compared in terms of general status, initial symptoms, and laboratory findings, and the risk factors for poor prognosis were analyzed.RESULTS: Compared with the good prognosis group, the poor prognosis group had a significantly higher proportion of children with a very low birth weight, a peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) of <5?109/L or >20?109/L, a C-reactive protein level of >50\\xe2\\x80\\x85mg/L, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) WBC of >500?106/L, a CSF glucose level of <1\\xe2\\x80\\x85mmol/L, or a CSF protein level of >2\\xe2\\x80\\x85g/L, as well as significantly higher positive rates of blood culture and/or CSF culture, Gram-positive bacteria, and Streptococcus agalactiae (P<0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a CSF glucose level of <1\\xe2\\x80\\x85mmol/L and a CSF protein level of >2\\xe2\\x80\\x85g/L were independent risk factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis.CONCLUSIONS: A CSF glucose level of <1\\xe2\\x80\\x85mmol/L and a CSF protein level of >2\\xe2\\x80\\x85g/L are risk factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis. labels: #Child#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Leukocyte Count#Meningitis, Bacterial#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors'
b'PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of implants inserted in maxillary sinuses augmented with 100% anorganic bovine bone (ABB) grafts versus mixed with 50% ABB and 50% autologous bone graft using a lateral window approach.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a randomised controlled trial of parallel groups. Patients in need of an implant-supported prosthesis in maxillary posterior areas, with a residual alveolar bone height ranging between 0 and 4 mm, were recruited for lateral sinus grafting and implant placement. Patients were randomly allocated to receive two different graft materials according to a parallel group design: group A was grafted with 50% ABB and 50% autogenous bone; group B was grafted with 100% ABB. After 7 months, tapered implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 20 and 45 Ncm. Three months later implants were loaded with screw-retained temporary crowns. Definitive crowns were delivered after 3 months. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis survival rates, complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, probing pocket depths (PPDs) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Clinical data were collected at definitive prosthesis delivery, and 1, 2 and 5 years after definitive loading.RESULTS: Thirty-two consecutive patients were treated with 32 sinus elevation procedures (16 group A, 16 group B). A total of 46 implants were inserted. One patient (with two implants) dropped out in group A, and two patients (with three implants) dropped out in group B. No implant/crown failed by the end of the study. Three complications (one sinus membrane perforation and two chipping of the ceramic) were observed in three patients in group A, versus none in group B (relative risk was 0.81; 95% CI 0.64-1.03; P = 0.225). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean marginal bone loss was 1.18 \\xc2\\xb1 0.50 mm (95% CI 0.95-1.45 mm) in group A and 1.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 0.97-1.43 mm) in group B, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups (difference 0.11 \\xc2\\xb1 0.22 mm; 95% CI -0.06-0.16 mm; P = 0.586). At the 5-year follow-up, the mean marginal bone loss was 1.37 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 1.13-1.86 mm) in group A and 1.42 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 1.17-1.90 mm) in group B (difference 0.15 \\xc2\\xb1 0.08 mm; 95% CI 0.10-0.22 mm; P = 0.426). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean PPD value was 2.70 \\xc2\\xb1 0.39 mm for group A and 2.54 \\xc2\\xb1 0.66 mm for group B, with no statistically significant difference between groups (difference 0.17 \\xc2\\xb1 0.39 mm; 95% CI 0.06-0.32 mm; P = 0.456). At the 5-year follow-up, the mean PPD value was 3.20 \\xc2\\xb1 0.44 mm for group A and 3.32 \\xc2\\xb1 0.49 mm for group B (difference 0.12 \\xc2\\xb1 0.43 mm; 95% CI 0.02-0.22 mm; P = 0.672). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean BOP value was 1.21 \\xc2\\xb1 0.79 for group A and 1.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.68 for group B (difference 0.06 \\xc2\\xb1 0.49; 95% CI -0.23-0.25; P = 0.297), and at the 5-year follow-up, the mean BOP value was 1.77 \\xc2\\xb1 0.62 for group A and 1.91 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 for group B (difference: 0.14 \\xc2\\xb1 0.51; 95% CI -0.05-0.33; P = 0.492).CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the present data confirm similar clinical outcomes of implants inserted in sinuses grafted with ABB versus implants inserted in sinuses grafted with mixed 50% ABB and 50% autologous bone. labels: #Animals#Bone Transplantation#Cattle#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis Design#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Humans#Maxillary Sinus'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the regulation role and mechanism of protein acetylation on the expression of glioblastoma-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in human glioma.METHODS: Six normal brain tissue samples, six low-grade glioma brain tissue (LG-glioma), and six high-grade glioma brain tissue (HG-glioma) were collected for study. Human glioma U251 cells were treated with histone acetylase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibition. The mRNA level of GDNF in glioma and normal controls was detected by Real-time PCR. H3K9 acetylation level of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) binding region on GDNF promoter and the ability of CREB combining to GDNF promoter were detected by ChIP-PCR. The effects of histone acetylase and deacetylase inhibitors on transcription factor binding ability and GDNF expression were detected.RESULTS: The mRNA level of GDNF in HG-glioma was significantly higher than those in normal brain tissue and LG-glioma (P < 0.01). The H3K9 acetylation level of GDNF promoter region in the glioma was increased compared to that in the normal brain tissue (P < 0.01), and the acetylation level in CREB-binding region on the GDNF promoter was higher than that in the non-CREB-binding region (P < 0.01). The binding activity of CREB and GDNF promoter in HG-glioma was higher than those in normal brain tissue and LG-glioma (P < 0.05). After treatment of U251 cells with histone acetyltransferase inhibition, the level of acetylation in CREB-binding region on GDNF promoter, the binding activity of CREB and GDNF promoter was decreased, and GDNF transcription and expression were down-regulated, while histone deacetylase inhibitors had the opposite effect (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Histone acetylation promotes the transcription expression of GDNF in glioma by promoting the binding of transcription factor CREB to the promoter region of GDNF gene. labels: #Acetylation#Cell Line, Tumor#Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor#Glioma#Histone Acetyltransferases#Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors#Histones#Humans#Promoter Regions, Genetic#Transcription, Genetic'
b'Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are considered to be the main cause of spontaneous abortion (SA). We aimed to determine the differences in the rates and numbers of chromosomal abnormalities between samples from women with a history of one versus more than one SA as well as between samples from first- and second-trimester SAs in women from Northeast China.In total, 1210 products of conception (POCs) from patients with a history of one or more SAs were examined. Of these 1210 samples, 434 were from women with a history of 1 SA, and 776 were from women with a history of more than 1 SA. Additionally, 1071 samples were from the first trimester, 118 were from the second trimester, and 21 were from the third trimester. We identified chromosomal abnormalities by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Among the 1210 POCs in women with SA, 607 (50.17%) had fetal chromosomal abnormalities. There were no significant differences in the rates of chromosomal abnormalities according to the abortion frequency. However, first-trimester SA had a significantly higher percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities than second-trimester SA (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). Among 663 chromosomal abnormalities, 633 abnormalities occurred in first-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 16 (14.38%), followed by monosomy X (13.27%), trisomy 22 (7.90%), and trisomy 15 (5.37%). Thirty abnormalities occurred in second-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 18 (26.67%), followed by monosomy X (16.67%), trisomy 21 (13.33%), and trisomy 13 (10.00%). No chromosomal abnormalities occurred in the third trimester.These findings indicate the importance of determining the genetic cause of abortion in patients with a history of SA. We also identified a trend suggesting that the percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities is significantly higher in first- than second-trimester SA. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in POCs from SA can be increased by NGS, which is beneficial for couples with recurrent miscarriages and offers better genetic counseling in the clinical setting. labels: #Abortion, Spontaneous#Chromosome Aberrations#DNA Copy Number Variations#Female#Fetus#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Pregnancy'
b"Objective: To investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic remedial surgery in patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer after endoscopic resection. Methods: The clinical and follow-up data of 12 patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer and then underwent endoscopic resection was collected. The clinicalpathological features and remedial indications were analyzed to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic remedial surgery. Results: The average number of lymph nodes in the lymph node dissection was 15 during remedial surgery, and 3 of them had lymph node metastasis. Among the 3 patients with residual cancer, two cases were poorly differentiated, 1 case was moderately differentiated, 1 case was positive for basal margin, and 1 case had vascular invasion. No lymph node metastasis occurred in the 9 patients who had no residual cancer. Among these, 8 cases were moderately differentiated, 1 case was poorly differentiated and 2 cases had positive basal margin. The average follow-up duration was 40 months and all 12 patients were in a state of survival at the last follow-up. During the follow-up of the 3 patients with residual cancer, 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with unknown prognosis; 1 patient received postoperative adjuvant radiochemotherapy, and lung metastasis occurred; 1 patient did not receive any treatment after surgery and survived for 33 months. Conclusions: Laparoscopic remedial surgery is a safe and feasible remedy for patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer after endoscopic resection. However, the choice of remedial strategy for colorectal carcinoma needs further investigation for patients with no vascular invasion, high degree of differentiation, and negative basal margin. labels: #Colorectal Neoplasms#Humans#Laparoscopy#Lymph Node Excision#Lymphatic Metastasis#Prognosis#Reoperation#Treatment Outcome"
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effect of the SCMC APL-2010 regimen in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in children.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 44 children with APL who received treatment with the SCMC APL-2010 regimen between April 2010 and July 2016. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate.RESULTS: Of the 44 children with APL, 42 (95%) achieved a complete remission (CR) after one course of treatment and 1 achieved CR after two courses of treatment, with an overall CR rate of 98%. The 9-year EFS and OS rates were 96%\\xc2\\xb13% and 97.7%\\xc2\\xb12.2% respectively. As for adverse events, 41 (93%) had infection, 29 (66%) had granulocyte reduction, 12 (27%, 1 died) had differentiation syndrome, 16 (36%) had liver dysfunction, 12 (27%) had adverse gastrointestinal reactions, and 7 (16%) had QT prolongation, 1 (2%) had orchitis, and no secondary neoplasm was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Children with APL receiving the SCMC APL-2010 regimen have a good prognosis and can achieve a long-term survival, while treatment-related infection is commonly seen. labels: #Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Child#Disease-Free Survival#Humans#Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute#Male#Remission Induction#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Tretinoin'
b'HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: Where Are We Today? Abstract. In sub-Saharan Africa the HIV epidemic has changed remarkedly due to expanded testing and easier access to antiretroviral medication. The rate of new infections has decreased substantially since 2005, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has increased and the mortality rate has declined. Yet still a lot needs to be achieved to stop the ongoing epidemic. Women are still at a higher risk to get infected and stigma and discrimination are a hindrance to further reduce the incidence. Challenges like the lack of technical capacities, especially to perform viral load and resistance testing, refusal of testing or condom use and increasing drug resistance to first-line therapies jeopardize the goal of 90-90-90: 90 % of people tested, 90 % of positives under care and 90 % of treated persons virologically controlled. New testing strategies and medication with higher efficacies which, when taken regularly, stop the transmission completely, provide hope in the fight against HIV. labels: #Africa South of the Sahara#Anti-HIV Agents#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Incidence#Social Stigma'
b'The effect of menaquinone-7 isolated from cheonggukjang was comparatively investigated with vitamin K1 and menaquinone-4 on cell differentiation and mineralization of the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. Results indicated that all vitamin K species significantly increased MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation, cellular alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin synthesis, and calcium deposition in a dose-dependent manner. Menaquinone-4 and menaquinone-7 had more potent effects on calcium deposition than vitamin K1, and their effects were only partly reduced by warfarin (\\xc3\\xa3-carboxylation inhibitor) treatment, while warfarin abolished the induction activity of vitamin K1 on calcification. This suggests that vitamin K1 and K2 (menaquinone-4 & menaquinone-7) may have different mechanisms in stimulating osteoblast mineralization. In addition, the mRNA expression ratio of osteoprotegerin and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand was also dramatically increased by treatment with vitamin K1 (62%), menaquinone-4 (247%), and menaquinone-7 (329%), suggesting that vitamin K may suppress the formation of osteoclast by up-regulating the ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand in osteoblasts. These results provide compelling evidence that vitamin K1, menaquinone-4, and menaquinone-7 all can promote bone health, which might be associated with elevations in the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand ratio. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Eggshell is the outermost calcified covering of an egg that protects it from microbial invasion and physical damage, and is critical for egg quality. However, understanding of the genes/proteins and the biological pathways regulating the eggshell formation is still obscure. We hypothesized that the transcriptomic analysis of the chicken uteri using RNA-sequencing may reveal novel genes and biological pathways involved in the eggshell biomineralization. RNA-sequence analysis using uteri of laying hens at 15-20\\xe2\\x80\\x89h post-ovulation (layers, n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x893) and non-laying (non-layers, n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x893) hens was carried out. About 229 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated in the layers compared to the non-layers. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed more than ten novel genes and biological pathways related to calcium transport and mineralization in the uterus. Based on the enriched pathways and molecular function analysis, 12 DEGs related to eggshell mineralization were further analyzed in the uteri of layers (3\\xe2\\x80\\x89h and 15-20\\xe2\\x80\\x89h post-ovulation), non-layers and molters using qPCR. Expressions of OC-116 (regulator of mineralization), OTOP2 (modulator of cellular calcium influx), CALCB (intracellular release of Ca-ions), STC2 (increases alkaline phosphatase activity), and ATP2C2 (cellular import of Ca-ions) were significantly higher in the uteri of laying hen at 15-20\\xe2\\x80\\x89h post-ovulation. This study identified the involvement of novel genes and their proposed biological pathways in the regulation of eggshell formation. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'De-escalation strategy is the gradual transition of various complex, expensive, high-risk but effective treatments for critically ill patients to simple, safe, physiological but still effective ones. Chronic critical illness refers to patients suffering severe disease or surgical hit who later shift into a chronic state of relapse or even aggravation and stay in the intensive care unit for extended period. Risk factors for surgical related chronic critical illness include advanced age, malnutrition, multiple organ dysfunction and multiple hits. During the treatment of critically ill patients, the strategy of de-escalation therapy should always be implemented, including rational use of antibiotics, de-escalation of liquid therapy (i.e. de-resuscitation), timely removal of ventilator, rapid introduction and with drawal of continuous renal replacement measures, parenteral + enteral nutrition support therapy and timely cessation of sedation. labels: #Chronic Disease#Conservative Treatment#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Intensive Care Units#Withholding Treatment'
b'Stress-induced injury is a common complication associated with patients with chronic critical illness (CCI). Skin-stretching device (SSD) and vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) technique are 2 approaches that can facilitate wound healing.In the present study, the effect of the concatenated application of the 2 techniques on the phases III and IV stress-induced injuries in aged patients with CCI was assessed. About 70 patients with CCI with stress-induced injuries were selected from February 2015 to October 2017. The treatment outcomes of the combined method and VSD method were assessed by comparing their clinicopathologic parameters.The results showed that the combined treatment shortened the average healing duration of wounds. Moreover, the total area of pressure sores, incidence of bleeding, bacteria amount, 28-day cure rate, peripheral C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and the hospitalization duration were all significantly improved in patients treated with SSD and VSD. The overall effective rate (97.14%) of patients treated with VSD and SSD was significantly higher than that (77.14%) in patients treated with VSD.The present study showed that the combined application of VSD and SSD improved the treatment outcomes of phases III and IV stress-induced injuries in aged patients with CCI. labels: #Age Factors#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Chronic Disease#Critical Illness#Female#Humans#Male#Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy#Pressure Ulcer#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Stress, Mechanical#Treatment Outcome'
b'OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact olanzapine (OLA) on the hippocampal neuron of model rats with depression.METHODS: Rats were divided into five groups: control, chronic unpredicted stress (CUS), OAL (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg), si-Atg5, and OAL (2 mg/kg)+si-Atg5. Open field and sucrose preference tests were performed to evaluate rat behaviors. Cell apoptosis was detected with Tunnel. The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1\\xc3\\xa2 and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. The expressions of cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-9, LC3, Beclin1, P62, NLRP3 and cleaved Caspase-1 were measured by Western blot.RESULTS: OAL (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) increased the total moving distance, sucrose consumption and preference rate of CUS rats, and decreased serum IL-18, cell apoptosis and the expressions of cleaved Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-1 and NLRP3 in the CA3 region of hippocampus. Although OAL (1, 2 mg/kg) decreased the expression of cleaved Caspase-3 and serum IL-1\\xc3\\xa2, OAL (0.5 mg/kg) showed no detectable effects. Si-Atg5 decreased the total moving distance, sucrose consumption and preference rate of CUS rats, enhanced the expressions of cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-1 and NLRP3, and weakened the effect of OAL (2 mg/kg). OAL (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) also increased the LC3?/LC3? ratio and the expression of Beclin1 in the CA3 region of hippocampus. OAL (1, 2 mg/kg) reduced the expression of p62, but not when it was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg. Si-Atg5 reduced the LC3?/LC3? ratio and the expression of Beclin1, and weakened the function of OAL (2 mg/kg).CONCLUSION: OAL can protect the hippocampal neuron of CUS rats via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. labels: #Animals#Depression#Hippocampus#Inflammasomes#Interleukin-18#Interleukin-1beta#NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein#Neurons#Neuroprotective Agents#Olanzapine#Rats'
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of T2WI signal intensity related parameters that can be obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with locally advanved rectal cancer (LARC). Methods: Signal Intensity of Tumor (SIT) and Signal Intensity of Tumor/Muscle (SIT/M) of MR T2WI before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of 101 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were evaluated by two experienced readers independently. Signal Intensity of Tumor Reduction Rate (SITRR) and Signal Intensity of Tumor/Muscle Reduction Rate (SIT/MRR) were calculated. The difference of related parameters of T2WI tumor signal intensity between the pCR and the non-pCR group were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance for predicting pCR. Results: Of the 101 patients, 18 were in pCR group and 83 were in non-pCR group. In all patients, the SITpre, SITpost, SITRR, SIT/Mpre, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by reader 1 were 197.0 (133.0), 144.2 (69.7), 0.4% (0.5%), 2.6 (0.6), 3.0 (2.3) and 0.4 (0.2)% in pCR group, and 227.0 (99.0), 205 (95.4), 0.1% (0.6%), 2.6 (0.6), 2.6 (1) in non-pCR group, respectively. SITpre, SITpost, SITRR, SIT/Mpre, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by reader 2 were 193.0 (135.0), 143.0 (69.8), 0.4% (0.2%), 2.6 (0.6), 1.5 (0.5) and 0.39% (0.2%) in pCR group, and 234.0(108.0), 203(96.5), 0.1% (0.3%), 2.6 (0.6%), 1.7 (0.7) and 0.25% (0.2%) in non-pCR group, respectively. Between the pCR and non-pCR group, there were significant differences in SITpost, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by both readers (all P<0.01), but there was no significant differences in SITpre and SIT/Mpre (P>0.05). The difference of SITRR measured by reader 1 was not statistically significant (P=0.415), while the difference of SITRR measured by reader 2 was statistically significant (P=0.001). In patients with rectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, SITpost, SIT/Mpost, SITRR and SIT/MRR measured by two physicians were still statistically significant between the pCR and non-pCR group (all P<0.01), but SITpre and SIT/Mpre had no significant difference (P>0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that in all patients, the area under curve (AUC) of SITpost, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer was 0.694-0.762, the sensitivity was 68.2%-77.3%, and the specificity was 63.6%-77.3%. In rectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma patients, the AUC, sensitivity and specificity was 0.704-0.764, 62.7%-78.9% and 66.2%-84.2%, respectively. Conclusions: T2WI signal intensity related parameters are potential predictors for pCR in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiptherapy. The predictive value is higher in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. labels: #Chemoradiotherapy#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Neoadjuvant Therapy#ROC Curve#Rectal Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome'
b'PURPOSE: This prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial evaluated the relationship between alveolar ridge dimensional change and recession with the implant position (horizontal and vertical) and tissue phenotype in immediately placed and provisionalised implants without the use of bone grafting.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 40) with a hopeless maxillary anterior tooth received an immediate implant and immediate provisional or customised healing abutment after flapless extraction. Implants were finally restored 3 months after placement and followed up for 6 months after delivery of the restoration. The alveolar ridge dimensional change and recession were measured using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and digitalised dental casts. Alveolar contour changes were correlated to implant position and tissue phenotype.RESULTS: The tissue phenotype showed no significant correlation to the alveolar ridge dimensional change. At 6 months, the average alveolar ridge dimensional change was approximately 0.7 mm in the buccolingual dimension independent of tissue phenotype. A statistically significant difference was observed on the recession values comparing tissue phenotypes, with more recession observed in the thin phenotype (1.96 mm) than in the thick phenotype (1.18 mm). A significant correlation was observed between horizontal implant position and buccolingual alveolar ridge change. A positive correlation was observed between the horizontal implant position and the dimensional change measured in the casts at the level of the free gingival margin. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the horizontal implant position and the resorption measured by the CBCT scans.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thin tissue phenotype had a more marked recession. The horizontal implant position showed a relationship to the alveolar ridge dimensional changes observed. The greater the buccal gap distance between the implant and the buccal plate, the lesser the radiographic changes observed in the alveolar bone, however, the greater the changes observed in the buccal aspect of the casts at the level of the free gingival margin. labels: #Alveolar Process#Dental Implants, Single-Tooth#Gingival Recession#Humans#Phenotype#Prospective Studies'
b"This study evaluated the effect of hypertension on tissue response and biomineralization capacity of white Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), High-plasticity MTA (MTA HP), and Biodentine\\xc2\\xae (BDT) in rats. Polyethylene tubes filled with MTA, MTA HP, BDT, and the control group (empty tubes) were placed into the dorsal subcutaneous tissue of 32 male rats (16 normotensive (NT) and 16 hypertensive rats - 8 per group). After 7 and 30 days, the polyethylene tubes surrounded by connective tissue were removed, fixed, and embedded in histological resin. The mean number of inflammatory cells was estimated in HE-stained sections, biomineralization was quantified as area (\\xc2\\xb5m2) by Kossa (VK) staining, and examination by polarized light (LP) microscopy was performed. The differences amongst the groups were analyzed statistically by the Mann-Whitney or Student's t test, according to Shapiro-Wilk test of normality (p < 0.05). The inflammatory responses to all materials were greater in hypertensive rats than in NT rats (p < 0.05). Positive VK staining in MTA and BDT were more pronounced in NT rats at 7 and 30 days (p < 0.05). Birefringent structures in LP for MTA, MTA HP, and BDT were more pronounced in NT rats at 7 days (p<0.05). In rats, hypertension was able to increase inflammatory infiltrate and decrease biomineralization of the tested materials. labels: #Biomineralization"
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current status of neglect in children aged 3-6 years in the rural areas of Urumqi, China and risk factors for neglect.METHODS: Stratified random cluster sampling was performed to select 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89326 children, aged 3-6 years, from 6 kindergartens in the rural areas of Urumqi. A self-designed questionnaire and "Chinese Neglect Evaluation Questionnaire for Rural Children Aged 3-6 Years" were used for investigation.RESULTS: Of the 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89326 children, the neglect rate was 51.89% (688 cases), and the degree of neglect was 49\\xc2\\xb16. There were significant differences in the neglect rate and the degree of neglect between the children in different age groups (P<0.01). The single-parent families and the remarried families had significantly higher child neglect rate and degree of neglect than the families of three generations under one roof and the core families (P<0.01). The children in left-behind status had a significantly higher degree of neglect (P<0.01). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that younger children, mothers with low education level, employment status of the mother as a migrant worker, single-parent and remarried families, low-income families, and left-behind status were risk factors for child neglect (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The neglect of children aged 3-6 years in the rural areas of Urumqi is serious, and more attention should be paid to younger children, children whose mothers with low education level, left-behind children, and children from single-parent families, remarried families and low-income families. labels: #Child#Child Abuse#Child, Preschool#China#Female#Humans#Mothers#Risk Factors#Rural Population#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b'Objective: To assess the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of multiple pregnancies. Methods: In this retrospective study, 84 cases (total 174 fetuses) of complex monochorionic pregnancies treated with RFA for selective fetal reduction were analyzed. All cases were managed in the Guangdong Women and Children Hospital from January 2015 to January 2018. Indications for offering RFA, details of the procedure and pregnancy outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: (1)The rate of miscarriage and fetal intrauterine death was 21% (18/84), termination of pregnancy because of fetal malformation or oligohydramnion occurred in 10% (8/84) of cases. Total live birth rate was 69% (58/84) and the gestation age at delivery was (35.0\\xc2\\xb13.0) weeks. (2) The live birth rate of twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (TRAPS) was the lowest (6/11), followed by twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS; 66%, 27/41), structural or genetic abnormalities of one fetus in monochorionic twin pregnancy (10/14), triplet pregnancy reduction (4/6) and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) (11/12). (3) The live birth rate was 67% (20/30) in stage ? of TTTS and 7/11 in the stage ? of TTTS (P>0.05). The average gestational age was (33.6\\xc2\\xb13.0) weeks in stage ? of TTTS compared with (36.5\\xc2\\xb12.4) weeks in the stage ?of TTTS (P<0.05). Conclusions: RFA appears to be a reliable option for selective fetal reduction in monochorionic multiple pregnancies. The indication of RFA is an influencing factor on its pregnancy outcomes. Type ?and type ? sIUGR may choose this technique as a priority. Compared with stage ? of TTTS, the live birth rate and the gestation age at delivery in stage ? of TTTS, there are no significant differences. labels: #Child#China#Female#Fetofetal Transfusion#Gestational Age#Humans#Live Birth#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Outcome#Pregnancy Reduction, Multifetal#Pregnancy, Twin#Prognosis#Radiofrequency Ablation#Retrospective Studies#Twins, Monozygotic'

In this study, we investigated the potential correlation between the TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C/C-509T polymorphism and increased risk of lung cancer through meta-analysis.METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library database, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang Data Information Service platform to identify relevant case-control studies in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to evaluate the correlation between TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 gene polymorphism and lung tumor risk. Sensitivity analysis and Egger test were used to evaluate the stability of the results and possible publication bias.RESULTS: A total of 8 studies, with 3680 patients and 4018 controls, were included. The meta-analysis revealed that there was no conspicuous correlation between the TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) variant and lung cancer in the overall population. For TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 C-509T, a significant decreased risk was identified in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the analysis stratified by disease (TT vs CT\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8aCC: P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02, OR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.90). However, for TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C, subgroup analysis showed no correlation between the T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in patients with NSCLC.

b'The bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans is capable of reducing toxic Au(i/iii)-complexes into metallic gold (Au) nano-particles, thereby mediating the (trans)formation of Au nuggets in Earth surface environments. In this study we describe a novel detoxification pathway, which prevents synergistic copper (Cu)/Au-toxicity. Gold-complexes and Cu-ions exert cooperative toxicity, because cellular uptake of Au(i/iii)-complexes blocks Cu(i) export from the cytoplasm by the Cu-efflux pump CupA. Using a combination of micro-analytical and biochemical methods we show that inducible resistance to these Cu/Au mixtures is mediated by the periplasmic Cu(i)-oxidase CopA, which functions as an oxygen-consuming Au(i)-oxidase. With high Au-complex loads the enzymatic activity of CopA detoxifies the reduction pathway of Au(iii)-complexes via Au(i)-intermediates to Au(0) nanoparticles in the periplasm. Thereby the concentration of highly toxic Au(i) in the cytoplasm is diminished, while allowing direct reduction of Au(iii) to Au nanoparticles in the periplasm. This permits C. metallidurans to thrive in Au-rich environments and biomineralise metallic Au. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Objective: To explore the differences in epidemiology and clinical features of Guillain- Barr? syndrome (GBS) between rural and urban areas of southern China. Methods: The clinical data of 759 hospitalized GBS patients from 31 hospitals of 13 provinces/cities in southern China, between January 1st, 2013 and September 30th, 2016, were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: The risk of GBS was higher for males than females in rural and urban areas and the median age was 49 and 48 years, respectively. Seasonal clustering in winter and spring was noted in both rural and urban areas, and the seasonal trend was more markedly in rural areas, but the differences showed no statistical significance. There were 70.37% of patients in rural areas and 73.69% in urban areas who had antecedent respiratory infection. The median time from onset to nadir was 7 days, and Hughes Disability Scale at admission, nadir and discharge were (2.95\\xc2\\xb11.10 vs 2.84\\xc2\\xb11.15), (3.25\\xc2\\xb11.11 vs 3.14\\xc2\\xb11.21), (2.02\\xc2\\xb11.24 vs 2.00\\xc2\\xb11.31) in rural and urban areas respectively. Albuminocytologic dissociation was present in 84.34% of patients in rural areas and 84.62% of cases in urban areas. There were 8.65% and 10.94% of cases in rural and urban areas who required mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, respectively. Demyelinating GBS accounted for 53.29% and 48.77%, respectively, in patients with findings of nerve conduction studies available in rural and urban areas. Conclusions: GBS in rural areas of southern China showed male predominance and a peak of spring and winter occurrence, with respiratory infection as the predominated preceding events and demyelinating GBS being main clinical subtype. Winter and spring showed a higher incidence of GBS in rural and urban areas. There were no significant differences of sex, age, preceding events, season trend, progression of disease, clinical subtypes and cerebrospinal fluid investigations in GBS patients between rural and urban areas. labels: #China#Female#Guillain-Barre Syndrome#Hospitalization#Humans#Incidence#Male#Retrospective Studies'
b'Introduction: According to the Hungarian law, placental examination is not mandatory, although it is known from the international practice that it can give valuable information in cases of stillbirth or in conditions, where the neonate has difficulty in the postnatal adaptation. Aim: It can be useful in the early detection of diseases, which otherwise would have gone undetected until late in life. This article is unique in Hungary, as no similar guideline exists in Hungarian language. Method: The recommendation of the Royal College of Pathologists (United Kingdom) determines those conditions where essential information can be obtained from the placental examination in not normal pregnancies. It serves as a useful guide in the medical practice. The journal titled "Placenta", first published in 1980 with impact factor above two, just underlines this statement. Results: In this article, the authors present the recent guideline of the RCPath and finish with the presentation of established clinicopathological association that might help clinicians to get the most valuable information from placental examination. Conclusion: The present article aims to summarise updated recommendations and present clinicopathological correlations.

b'The objective of this study was to observe the impact of temperature on pearl formation using an integrative approach describing the rotation of the pearls, the rate of nacre deposition, the thickness of the aragonite tablets and the biomineralizing potential of the pearl sac tissue though the expression level of some key genes. Fifty pearl oysters were grafted with magnetized nuclei to allow the rotation of the pearls to be described. Four months later, 32 of these pearl oysters were exposed to four temperatures (22, 26, 30 and 34\\xc2\\xb0C) for 2\\xe2\\x80\\x85weeks. Results showed that the rotation speed differed according to the movement direction: pearls with axial movement had a significantly higher rotation speed than those with random movement. Pearl growth rate was influenced by temperature, with a maximum between 26 and 30\\xc2\\xb0C but almost no growth at 34\\xc2\\xb0C. Lastly, among the nine genes implicated in the biomineralization process, only Pmarg-Pif177 expression was significantly modified by temperature. These results showed that the rotation speed of the pearls was not linked to pearl growth or to the expression profiles of biomineralizing genes targeted in this study. On the basis of our results, we consider that pearl rotation is a more complex process than formerly thought. Mechanisms involved could include a strong environmental forcing in immediate proximity to the pearl. Another implication of our findings is that, in the context of ocean warming, pearl growth and quality can be expected to decrease in pearl oysters exposed to temperatures above 30\\xc2\\xb0C. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'PURPOSE: Short implants are a minimally invasive alternative in the management of alveolar bone atrophy. This study aimed to assess the influence of the surgical approach (1-stage vs 2-stage) on the 15-year survival and marginal bone loss of short implants in a fixed complete denture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was conducted in a single private dental clinic that included short implants placed between January 2001 and December 2002.RESULTS: Forty-one short implants supported 18 screw-retained complete dentures. The mean follow-up time was 15 \\xc2\\xb1 3 years. The surgical approach (1-stage vs 2-stage) did not significantly affect implant survival and marginal bone loss. The implant survival rate was 90.2%.CONCLUSIONS: Short dental implants could be predictably indicated to support fixed complete dentures.

b'RATIONALE: Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to long-term viral suppression, reduces proviral reservoir size, and prolongs time to rebound. Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lifelong disease, diagnostic monitoring after confirmed infection is typically not performed; therefore, little is known about the impact of early initiation and long-term ART on the sensitivity of assays that detect HIV antibodies and viral nucleic acid in children and adolescents.PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report 1 case of diagnosed and confirmed perinatal HIV-1C infection with longstanding viral suppression, who subsequently had a negative HIV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test, undetectable antibodies to HIV-1, and high CD4+ T cell count after 14 years of ART.DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with HIV in 2002 at 1 and 2 months of age using DNA polymerase chain reaction. At 8 months old, his viral load was 1210 HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL and CD4 T cell count was 3768\\xe2\\x80\\x8acells/mm.INTERVENTION: At the age of 9 months, highly active antiretroviral therapy comprising of zidovudine, nevirapine, and lamivudine was initiated. The patient remained on this treatment for 14 years 11 months and was virally suppressed.OUTCOMES: At the age of 14 years 4 months, the participant decided to visit a local voluntary HIV testing center, where a rapid HIV test came out negative and the viral load was undetectable (<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). These results led to termination of ART which led to viral rebound within 9 months.LESSONS: As more people with early HIV infection initiate early ART in the context of "Test and Treat all" recommendations, aspects of this report may become more commonplace, with both clinical and public health implications. If the possibility of functional cure (or false-positive diagnosis) is being considered, decisions to terminate ART should be made cautiously and with expert guidance, and may benefit from highly sensitive quantification of the proviral reservoir. labels: #Adolescent#Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active#DNA, Viral#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#HIV-1#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Male#Proviruses#Time Factors#Virus Activation#Withholding Treatment'
b'Understanding the biomineralization pathways in living biological species is a grand challenge owing to the difficulties in monitoring the mineralization process at sub-nanometer scales. Here, we monitored the nucleation and growth of magnetosome nanoparticles in bacteria and in real time using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). To enable biomineralization within the bacteria, we subcultured magnetotactic bacteria grown in iron-depleted medium and then mixed them with iron-rich medium within graphene liquid cells (GLCs) right before imaging the bacteria under the microscope. Using in situ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), the oxidation state of iron in the biomineralized magnetosome was analysed to be magnetite with trace amount of hematite. The increase of mass density of biomineralized magnetosomes as a function of incubation time indicated that the bacteria maintained their functionality during the in situ TEM imaging. Our results underpin that GLCs enables a new platform to observe biomineralization events in living biological species at unprecedented spatial resolution. Understanding the biomineralization processes in living organisms facilitates the design of biomimetic materials, and will enable a paradigm shift in understanding the evolution of biological species. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'RATIONALE: Managing the health of vulnerable groups is an important component of health care. Given the long-term burden of radiation-release incidents among those exposed, managing the health of vulnerable groups following a nuclear disaster is very important. However, there is limited information available concerning the long-term management of the health effects of radiation exposure in vulnerable groups following nuclear disasters. After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, Minamisoma City launched internal radiation exposure monitoring program for local residents, using whole body counter (WBC) units. In 2017, a man of low socio-economic status (SES), was found to have the highest level of internal contamination detected in a person living in the Soma District in recent years. This report describes the case so that the lessons learned can be applied in future nuclear disaster settings.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old Japanese man, who had been homeless for 2 months and had been staying in the exclusion zone of Minamisoma City, was brought to our hospital. He had become homeless because a lack of communication between social support services had led to his eviction from leased housing after free housing support for evacuees was terminated.DIAGNOSES: He was admitted with a diagnosis of dehydration and malnutrition. A WBC unit was used to assess his body burden of radioactive cesium. This revealed levels of Cs-134 and Cs-137 of 538\\xe2\\x80\\x8aBq/body and 4,993\\xe2\\x80\\x8aBq/body, respectively.INTERVENTION: He received intravenous fluid therapy and health monitoring. The paperwork required for him to receive public income support was processed during hospitalization.OUTCOME: He was discharged to public housing after 9 days, and municipal workers started visiting him regularly after his discharge.LESSONS: A high level of internal radiation contamination may occur after a nuclear disaster. This may be associated with a decline in social support, poverty, and social isolation, and may have more impact on people in poor health than on the general population. It would be useful to strengthen linkages between local government and welfare service providers to increase social support for vulnerable groups requiring health care, not only following disasters, but also under normal circumstances. labels: #Aged#Fukushima Nuclear Accident#Humans#Male#Radiation Exposure#Social Class#Time Factors#Whole-Body Counting'
b'The Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) published the guidelines 2019 for the treatment of colorectal cancer in March 2019. The new edition expanded the indications of endoscopic treatment, enriched the follow-up recommendations after endoscopic resection of early colorectal cancer, supplemented the indications of ISR and added the recommendations of lymph node recurrence and peritoneal recurrence. In the new edition, the adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy schemes were revised and patients with first-line chemotherapy were divided into three categories as follows: appropriate for intensive systemic therapy (fit), inappropriate for intensive systemic therapy (vulnerable), and inappropriate for systemic therapy (frail). The new edition of guidelines can also provide references to the doctors of colorectal cancer in our country.

b'Species of the Ostreidae family are key ecosystem engineers and many of them - including Crassostrea gigas and Crassostreavirginica - are commercially important aquaculture species. Despite similarities in their morphology and ecology, these two species differ in their ability to defend against pathogens, potentially reflecting species-specific differential specialization of hemocytes on immune defense versus biomineralization. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression levels of immune- and biomineralization-related genes as well as mineralogical and mechanical properties of the shells and the calcium sequestration ability of the hemocytes of C. gigas and C. virginica The expression of biomineralization-related genes was higher in C. virginica than in C. gigas in multiple tissues including the mantle edge and hemocytes, while the expression of immune genes was higher in the hemocytes of C. gigas Hemocytes of C. virginica contained more calcium (stored intracellularly as calcium carbonate mineral) compared with those of C. gigas Analysis of the adult shells showed that the crystallinity of calcite was higher and the laths of the foliated layer of the shell were thicker in C. virginica than in C. gigas Mechanically, the shells of C. virginica were stiffer, harder and stronger than those of C. gigas Taken together, our results show that the species-specific differences in physiology (such as disease resistance and exoskeleton properties) are reflected at the cellular and molecular levels in the differential specialization of hemocytes on potentially competing functions (immunity and biomineralization) as well as different expression profiles of other tissues involved in biomineralization (such as the mantle edge). labels: #Biomineralization'
b'Diamond like carbon (DLC) films were deposited onto Ti6Al4V and Si wafer substrates by RF plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The influence of dopants such as fluorine (F), silicon (Si), and nitrogen (N) on composition, structure, and biocompatibility was investigated. Ion scattering spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of dopant atoms in the outer-most layers of the films. Raman studies showed that the position of the G-band shifts to higher frequencies with the fluorine and nitrogen content in the DLC film, whereas the incorporation of Si into DLC induces a decrease of the position of the G peak. The corrosion behavior was studied in simulated body fluid. A higher charge transfer resistance (Rct) was observed for the doped DLC films. The indirect cytotoxicity was performed using L929 fibroblast cells. The coated surfaces were hemocompatible when tested with red blood cells. DLC films were noncytotoxic to L929 cells over a 24\\xe2\\x80\\x89h exposure. Saos-2 osteoblast cell response to the doped and undoped DLC coated surfaces was studied in adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization assays. The production of calcium and phosphate by cells on doped DLC, particularly, nitrogen doped DLC, was higher than that on undoped DLC. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'It has become increasingly apparent that the environmental microorganisms residing in uranium (U) enriched sites offer the possibility of understanding the biological mechanisms catalyzing the processes important for uranium bioremediation. Here, we present the results of uranium biomineralization over a wide pH range by a metal tolerant Serratia sp. strain OT II 7 isolated from the subsurface soil of a U ore deposit at Domiasiat in India. The Serratia cells actively expressed acid and alkaline phosphatase enzymes which hydrolyzed differential amounts of phosphate from an organophosphate substrate in the presence of uranium between pH 5 to 9. These cells precipitated ?91% uranium from aqueous solutions supplemented with 1 mM uranyl nitrate at pH 5 within 120 h. More rapid precipitation was observed at pH 7 and 9 wherein the cells removed ?93-94% of uranium from solutions containing 1 mM uranyl carbonate within 24 h. The aqueous uranyl speciation prevalent under the studied pH conditions influenced the localization of crystalline uranyl phosphate precipitates, which in turn, impacted the cell viability to a great extent. Furthermore, the cells tolerated up to ?1.6 kGy 60Co gamma radiation and their uranium precipitation abilities at pH 5, 7 and 9 were uncompromised even after exposure to a high dose of ionizing radiation. Overall, this study establishes the ecological adaptation of a natural strain like Serratia in a uranium enriched environment and corroborates its contribution towards uranium immobilization in contaminated subsurfaces through the formation of stable uranyl phosphate minerals over a wide pH range. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'This work reports the modification of freeze/thaw poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel using citric acid as the bioactive molecule for hydroxyapatite formation in simulated body fluid. Inclusion of 1.3 mM citric acid into the poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel showed that the mechanical strength, crystalline phase, functional groups and swelling ability were still intact. Adding citric acid at higher concentrations (1.8 and 2.3 mM), however, resulted in physically poor hydrogels. Presence of 1.3 mM of citric acid showed the growth of porous hydroxyapatite crystals on the poly(vinyl alcohol) surface just after one day of immersion in simulated body fluid. Meanwhile, a fully covered apatite layer on the poly(vinyl alcohol) surface plus the evidence of apatite forming within the hydrogel were observed after soaking for seven days. Gel strength of the soaked poly(vinyl alcohol)/citric acid-1.3 mM hydrogel revealed that the load resistance was enhanced compared to that of the neat poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel. This facile method of inducing rapid growth of hydroxyapatite on the hydrogel surface as well as within the hydrogel network can be useful for guided bone regenerative materials. labels: #Biomineralization'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of "Yinqi Guiyuan" needling in the treatment of primary insomnia.METHODS: A total of 79 primary insomnia outpatients were randomly divided into treatment group (n=40) and control group (n=39). The patients in the control group were given oral Estazolam tablets once a day, for successive 4 weeks. For patients of the treatment group, Zhongwan (CV12), Xiawan (CV10), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), Baihui (GV20), etc., were punctured with filiform needles for 30 min. The treatment was conducted three times per week for 4 successive weeks. The sleep quality (sleeping quality, falling asleep time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, hypnotic and daytime dysfunction, 0 to 21 points) was evaluated by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The severity of insomnia (self-perception, sleep satisfaction, daytime function damage, sensibility change, and concern for sleep problems, 0 to 28 points) was assessed using insomnia severity index (ISI) score. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the PSQI score reduction rate = (pre-treatment PSQI score-post-treatment PSQI score)/pre-treatment PSQI score ?100%.RESULTS: After treatment, the total score of PSQI, ISI and the score of each item were all significantly reduced in the two groups relevant to their own pre-treatment (P<0.05). The total score, and scores of hypnotic and daytime dysfunction were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05). Of the 40 and 39 cases in the treatment and control groups, 5 (12.50%) and 4 (10.25%) were cured, 20 (50.00%) and 18 (46.15%) experienced marked improvement, 12 (30.00%) and 13 (33.33%) were effective, and 3 (7.50%) and 4 (10.25%) ineffective, with the total effective rate being 92.50% and 89.74%, respectively. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the effective rate (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: "Yinqi Guiyuan" needling and Estazolam are comparable in treatment primary insomnia, and the former is superior to the latter in avoiding hypnotic drug use and in improving daytime function. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Acupuncture Therapy#Humans#Sleep#Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders#Treatment Outcome'

b'AIMS: The newly formed geometry between the native Valsalva and implanted transcatheter heart valve (THV) may induce local thrombogenicity. This study aimed to assess the incidence of and the clinical outcomes associated with Valsalva thrombus formation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated the multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) data of 338 patients following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a balloon-expandable THV. The Valsalva and leaflet thrombi were assessed by MDCT at the left coronary cusp (LCC), right coronary cusp (RCC), and non-coronary cusp (NCC). Combined endpoints such as death, stroke, and readmission for heart failure rates in patients with and without Valsalva and/or leaflet thrombus were examined at two years. The overall incidence of Valsalva and leaflet thrombi was 8.9% and 8.3%, respectively. Significant differences in the location of the Valsalva thrombus in the LCC, RCC, and NCC were noted (5.0%, 4.2%, 8.9%, respectively, p<0.001). The independent predictor for increased risk of Valsalva thrombus was high Valsalva area to implanted THV size ratio (odds ratio 11.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.67-83.0, p=0.013). Combined endpoints were similar in patients with and without Valsalva thrombus, Valsalva/leaflet thrombus, and leaflet thrombus (p>0.05 for all).CONCLUSIONS: Valsalva thrombus was detected in 8.9% of patients following balloon-expandable THV implantation and was common in the LCC, but it did not increase the risk of adverse events after TAVI. labels: #Aortic Valve#Aortic Valve Stenosis#Heart Valve Prosthesis#Humans#Japan#Multidetector Computed Tomography#Prosthesis Design#Registries#Retrospective Studies#Thrombosis#Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement#Treatment Outcome'
b'The catshark genus Scyliorhinus belongs to the family Scyliorhinidae, the most diverse family of sharks, and currently presents 16 valid species according to most modern accounts. The long history of taxonomic rearrangements and inaccurate descriptions of many species have contributed to misidentification of specimens and lack of information on the distributional range and diagnostic characters of its species. Species of Scyliorhinus are reviewed and redescribed here, with detailed descriptions on external morphology, neurocranium, claspers, dermal denticles, and tooth morphology provided for the first time for all species. Sixteen species are recognized as valid: Scyliorhinus boa (Goode Bean, 1896), S. cabofriensis Soares, Gomes de Carvalho, 2016, S. canicula (Linnaeus, 1758), S. capensis (M?ller Henle, 1838), S. cervigoni Maurin Bonnet, 1970, S. comoroensis Compagno, 1988, S. duhamelii (Garman, 1913), S. garmani (Fowler, 1934), S. haeckelii (Miranda Ribeiro, 1907), S. hesperius Springer, 1966, S. meadi Springer, 1966, S. retifer (Garman, 1881), S. stellaris (Linnaeus, 1758), S. torazame (Tanaka, 1908), S. torrei Howell-Rivero, 1936, and S. ugoi Soares, Gomes Gadig, 2015. The main taxonomic decisions herein taken include the resurrection of S. duhamelii (previously a junior synonym of S. canicula) and the synonimization of S. tokubee with S. torazame. Information on geographic distribution was updated for most species, especially for those with wide ranges (S. canicula, S. haeckelii, S. retifer, and S. stellaris). labels: #Animals#Fabaceae#Fishes#Sharks#Skull'
b'Objective: To investigate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary clinical experience of ultrasonic guided percutaneous portal vein punctures combined bi-directional angiography in the treatment by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt(TIPS). Methods: From January 2016 to June 2018, 15 patients with TIPS from our hospital who were treated by ultrasonic guided percutaneous portal vein punctures combined with bi-directional angiography were enrolled,and were recruited as experimental group. During the same period, 30 patients who were treated by TIPS combined with traditional methods were enrolled, and were recruited as control group. There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P > 0.05). The portal pressure difference in preoperative and postoperative, the fluoroscopy time, the number of puncture needles and complications were recorded. After treatment, the patients were followed up through outpatient service or telephone method. Results: The technical success rate was 100% in experimental group, and 96.7% in control group. In the experimental group, number of percutaneous transhepatic portal vein puncture by needle was 1-3 (average, 2.13 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 0.74), and the number of portal vein puncture needles in the control group were 1-11 (average, 4.16 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 2.13). The number of puncture needles in the experimental group were significantly decreased than in the control group (P < 0.001). In the experimental group, the fluoroscopy time was 18 ~ 46 (average 29.64 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 8.79) minutes. In the control group, the fluoroscopy time was 12 ~ 150 (average 44.57 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 26.84) minutes.The fluoroscopy time was significantly reduced in the experimental group compared with the control group(P = 0.023). Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided portal vein combined with bidirectional angiog-raphy is safe, feasible, and reliable in the treatment by TIPS. Compare with traditional TIPS, it can reduce the fluoroscopy time, the number of puncture needles and the liver injury. labels: #Angiography#Fluoroscopy#Humans#Needles#Portal Pressure#Portal Vein#Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic#Punctures#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Ultrasonography'

b"Aims: The objective of this in vitro study was to find out the efficacy of Novamin in remineralizing enamel surface on which artificial caries lesion had been created. The changes were analyzed using Vickers Hardness Testing Machine and Scanning electron microscope (SEM).Settings and Design: A total of 40 primary teeth were selected and divided into two groups: Control group and SHY NM (Novamin). All the samples were subjected to ph cycle protocol and assessed using Vickers Hardness Testing Machine and Scanning electron microscope. Each demineralized sample was randomly divided into two groups: Gp I -Control group, Gp II - Novamin (SHY NM). After 10-day period of ph cycle, the obtained data was analyzed statistically.Statistical Analysis Used: Pre and post groups were compared by paired t test. The significance of mean difference between the groups was done by Tukey's post hoc test after ascertaining normality by Shapiro-Wilk (W) test and homogeneity of variance by Levene's test. A two-tailed P value less than 0.05 (P < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed on SPSS software (Windows version 17.0).Results: Statistical analysis showed that bioactive glass (novamin) remineralizes artificially induced carious lesion in primary teeth.Conclusions: SHY NM (Novamin) exhibited superior remineralization potential. labels: #Glass#Hardness#Humans#Microscopy, Electron, Scanning#Tooth Remineralization#Tooth, Deciduous"
b'Disease-specific and site-selective deficiency of an RNA editing enzyme, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), has been demonstrated in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) motor neurons. ADAR2 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through \\\\xc3\\\\xa1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors via adenosine-to-inosine conversion at the glutamine/arginine site of GluA2 mRNA, which makes ADAR2 a key factor in acquired Ca<sup>2+</sup> resistance in motor neurons. Deficient ADAR2 of sALS motor neurons is supposed to lead to excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through AMPA receptors, resulting in TDP-43 pathology and nuclear pore complex pathology, and eventually motor neuronal death. We considered that AMPA receptor antagonists could strongly prevent excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through AMPA receptors and block motor neuronal degeneration in sALS. Perampanel, a selective non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, has been reported to prevent deterioration in a mouse model for sALS, in which ADAR2 is conditionally knocked out in motor neurons. Because of the therapeutic potency of perampanel for sporadic ALS, we have performed a multicenter randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 clinical trial. The primary outcome measure is the change in ALS functional rating scale-revised after 48 weeks of treatment. The results of this study will be available in early 2020. labels: #Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis#Humans#Motor Neurons#Pyridones'
b'This non-interventional study evaluated the implant survival and success of a new bone-level tapered implant design in seven private dental practices in the United States. One hundred subjects in need of implant(s) were enrolled according to all cleared indications. After implant surgery, subjects were followed for a period of 1-year post-loading. Treatment planning, implant stability, radiographic evaluation of bone levels, soft-tissue characteristics, clinician satisfaction, and adverse events were assessed. A total of 184 implants were placed, of which 172 were evaluable at 1-year follow-up. Of the 172 evaluable implants, 169 survived and were successful at 1-year post-loading. Of 152 implants with radiographs at 1 year, 90% showed no bone remodeling or <1 mm bone loss. Overall clinician satisfaction was high across all centers. Normal soft-tissue profiles were reported around the implants with improvement in color, form, and mucosal attachment at 1 year. In a "real-world" setting this observational study demonstrated high implant survival and success, stable crestal bone levels, high clinician satisfaction, and a low incidence of adverse events. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Implants#Dental Prosthesis Design#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Follow-Up Studies#Private Practice#Prospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b'Sparsorythus is a genus of Tricorythidae from the Oriental Region. Sparsorythus multilabeculatus Sroka Sold?n, 2008 was described based on a male imago from Vietnam. Unknown nymphs and female subimagines of Sparsorythus and male imagines of S. multilabeculatus were collected from Thap Lan National Park, Khon Buri District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand. Nymphs and female subimagines of Sparsorythus were associated with male imagines of S. multilabeculatus by analyzing sequences from the DNA barcoding region of the mitochrondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I. Phylogenetic analysis based on Maximum Likelihood indicated that all unknown specimens are conspecific with male imagines of S. multilabeculatus (bootstrap 100% and genetic distance 0-0.004). Male and female nymphs, female subimago and egg are described for the first time. Nymphs each bear a medial emargination on the hypopharynx, one bristle-like process at the base of the left prostheca, and a bifurcate rudimentary gill on abdominal segment VII. The male usually has smudges and light blotches on its forewings; the penis extends to the basal segment of the forceps and reaches to approximately 1/3 of the second segment of the forceps. Forewings of the female subimago have dark colour over more than half of the basal area, and the distal portion of each wing is translucent. The egg has a rounded pole; the polar cap covers approximately 1/4 of the surface; and the surface is covered with hexagonal structures. labels: #Animal Distribution#Animal Structures#Animals#Base Sequence#Ephemeroptera#Female#Male#Phylogeny#Thailand#Vietnam'
b'Vallissiana universitaria Pereira Ar?valo, a new genus and species of leaf-miner moth (Gracillariidae: Gracillariinae) is described and illustrated with the aid of optical and scanning electron microscopy, including adults, larva, pupa and the mine. Its monophyletic status is confirmed within the subfamily based on a DNA barcode CoI tree. The immature stages are associated with Erythroxylum argentinum O. E. Schulz (Erythroxylaceae) and four larval instars are found, all forming a round blotch mine from the beginning of ontogeny. The first two instars are sap-feeders, using only the epidermal cells, whereas the last two are tissue-feeders, mining the parenchyma cells. Pupation occurs inside the leaf mine within a flimsy, silk-made cocoon. This is the third endemic genus of gracillariid moths described from the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and the first associated with Erythroxylum P. Browne. Characteristics found on the forewing and in the last abdominal segments of the adult were determinant for the proposition of the new genus. The CoI tree indicated that it is closely related to Aspilapteryx, while this genus was recovered as polyphyletic in the analyses. Morphological evidence supports this polyphyly. Consequently, Sabulopteryx Triberti, 1985, stat. nov. is considered a valid genus. labels: #Animals#Brazil#Erythroxylaceae#Forests#Larva#Lepidoptera#Moths'
b'A new genus and species of pygmy grasshopper (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) is described from Eocene Baltic amber. Danatettix hoffeinsorum gen. et sp. nov. is assigned to the subfamily Batrachideinae based on antennae with more than 19 antennomeres, sulcate mesofemora, and rectangular paranota. This species is readily distinguished from other batrachideines by a markedly produced vertex, pronotum with divergent internal and external lateral carinae, and highly setiferous female lateral basivalvular sclerite with scabrose integument. The morphology of Danatettix suggests placement within the here defined Tettigidea genus group (comprising Eutettigidea Hancock, 1914, Paurotarsus Hancock, 1900, and Tettigidea Scudder, 1862) and suggests that the latter had diverged from the new Scaria genus group (comprising Eotetrix Gorochov, 2012, Rehnidium Grant, 1956 and Scaria Bol?var, 1887) by the Early Eocene. labels: #Amber#Animals#Baltic States#Coleoptera#Europe#Female#Fossils#Grasshoppers#Orthoptera'
b'The demosponge genus Endectyon is characterized by the presence of acanthostyles with recurved or clavulate spines. Two subgenera are recognized, Endectyon and Hemectyon, distinguished mainly by the acanthostyles being located only in the periphery of the axial skeleton in Endectyon, or forming the ectosomal brushes in Hemectyon. Sixteen species are known worldwide, of which only two were reported from the Western Atlantic Ocean. However, the type locality of Endectyon xerampelina is uncertain, and it could be located either in the Western Atlantic or in Australia. In the present study, we describe new records of E. xerampelina from the Brazilian coast and propose that Raspailia (R.) johnhooperi from the Guyana shelf is a junior synonym of E. xerampelina. Our results support the hypothesis that the type locality of E. xerampelina is located somewhere in the Tropical Western Atlantic Ocean and also that the species belongs to the subgenus Endectyon (Endectyon). We amended the diagnosis of the subgenus Endectyon (Endectyon) to account for the variability of acanthostyle shape in E. (E.) xerampelina, assigning greater taxonomic value to the position of the echinating megascleres than to their shape and pattern of spination. labels: #Animal Distribution#Animals#Atlantic Ocean#Australia#Brazil#Guyana#Porifera'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features and treatments of congenital submandibular duct dilatation.METHODS: Seven children with congenital submandibular duct dilatation from January 2008 to March 2018 were included in this study, whose average age was 5 months and 22 days. The clinical manifestations are unilateral swelling of the mouth floor. All seven children underwent sublingual gland resection, submandibular gland dilatation catheter resection, and catheter reroute under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the orifice of the submandibular gland was constricted and part of the catheter was dilated.RESULTS: All seven patients had good healing without swelling or cyst formation.CONCLUSIONS: Congenital submandibular duct dilatation occurs at a young age. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent further expansion of the catheter and avoid gland atrophy, feeding difficulty, and breathing obstruction. Simultaneous excision of the sublingual gland can avoid the formation of postoperative sublingual cyst. labels: #Child#Dilatation#Humans#Infant#Ranula#Salivary Ducts#Sublingual Gland#Submandibular Gland'

b'AIM: The aim of the work was to evaluate the voice quality of 10 adult patients after thyroplasty type I using a silicone block. Preoperatively patients suffered from unilateral vocal fold paralysis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated selected preoperative and postoperative patient findings (RBH according to Wendler classification, videolaryngostroboscopy and maximum phonation time MPT). The evaluation was performed by a phoniatrician and clinical speech therapist, using patient medical records and the Lingwaves and Glottis Analysis Tools (GAT) programs.RESULTS: Preoperatively we identified R1B1H1 - R3B3H3, postoperatively R0B0H0 - R3B3H2. In six cases the paralysed vocal cord was preoperatively in a paramedian position, twice in intermediate position and twice in a lateral position. In the case of 6 patients presbyphonic changes were present. Motility of the healthy vocal cord was within the norm. Postoperatively, the paretic vocal cord was medialised. We assessed the MPT value: preoperatively 3\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9210 seconds, postoperatively 9\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9217 seconds. Postoperatively we measured jitter (%), shimmer (%) and closing quotient values. In comparison with healthy subjects (Inwald et al. 2011), jitter and shimmer values were higher and closing quotient values after thyroplasty type I close to normal values (Tab.1).CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative voice quality was significantly better in comparison with the preoperative state; though, it never achieved the parameters of a normal voice. We confirmed the significant contribution of TPL I for the patients? quality of life through partial rehabilitation of their voices. labels: #Adult#Humans#Laryngoplasty#Quality of Life#Silicones#Treatment Outcome#Vocal Cord Paralysis#Voice Quality'

b'A new species of free-living marine nematode is described from Itapu? beach, northeast of Brazil. Pomponema veronicae sp. n. differs from other species of Pomponema by having buccal cavity with large pointed dorsal tooth, two subventral teeth and pairs of denticles, gubernaculum with two L-shaped lateral plates and having a membrane at its distal end that connects to L-shaped plate, and presence of a ventral orifice at distal end of L-shaped plates. It also differs from other species in the size of spicules and gubernaculum. The new species is considered most closely related to Parapomponema species because of the L-shaped lateral plates of gubernaculum, but the taxonomic status of Parapomponema was reviewed and Parapomponema and Propomponema are now synonymized with Pomponema.

b"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the behavior of cardiac autonomic modulation in individuals with different times after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx) using symbolic dynamics analysis.METHODS: Sixty patients were evaluated after HTx. We recorded their instantaneous R-R intervals (RRi) by cardiac monitor Polar\\\\xc2\\\\xae RS800CX\\\\xe2\\\\x84\\\\xa2 (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) for 10 minutes. The same sequence of RRi with 256 consecutive beats was used to perform spectral analysis and symbolic dynamics analysis. We used hierarchical clustering to form groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (with Holm-Sidak method) or one-way Kruskal-Wallis test (with Dunn?s post-hoc test) was used to analyze the difference between groups. Linear correlation analysis between variables was performed using Pearson's or Spearman's tests. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: The 0V% index increased, the 2UV% index and the normalized complexity index decreased with an increase of HTx postoperative time. There were a negative correlation between complexity indexes and 0V% and a positive correlation between complexity indexes and 2UV%.CONCLUSION: Symbolic dynamics indexes were able to show a specific cardiac autonomic modulation pattern for HTx recipients with different postoperative times. labels: #Adult#Analysis of Variance#Cross-Sectional Studies#Entropy#Female#Heart#Heart Rate#Heart Transplantation#Humans#Linear Models#Male#Middle Aged#Nonlinear Dynamics#Parasympathetic Nervous System#Postoperative Period#Reference Values#Retrospective Studies#Statistics, Nonparametric#Sympathetic Nervous System#Time Factors"
b'Objective To investigate the role of RAD51 in cell proliferation, migration and chemosensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) using U251 glioma cell line, and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods TCGA database was utilized to analyze the expression changes of RAD51 in gliomas. RAD51 was over-expressed or knocked down in U251 glioma cells via lentivirus infection, or its activity was inhibited by small molecule inhibitors. Cell proliferation and migration ability were examined by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and scratch wound-healing assay; CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were performed to assess the effect of RAD51 on the sensitivity of glioma cells upon the treatment of temozolomide. Western blotting was used to determine the alteration of P53. Results The expression of RAD51 significantly increased in glioma tissues. RAD51 enhanced the proliferation and migration ability of U251 glioma cells; knockdown of RAD51 enhanced the sensitivity of U251 glioma cells to temozolomide. Over-expression of RAD51 increased the expression of P53, whereas knockdown of RAD51 decreased the expression of P53. Conclusion RAD51 plays an oncogene function in glioma cells. RAD51 over-expression enhances the proliferation and migration of glioma cells. RAD51 knockdown increases the sensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide. labels: #Apoptosis#Brain Neoplasms#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Gene Knockdown Techniques#Glioblastoma#Humans#Rad51 Recombinase#Temozolomide'
b'INTRODUCTION: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x82The prevalence of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) and cystic echinococcosis (CE) in Germany is increasing. The number of cases in northern and eastern regions is low, so there is little experience with regard to diagnosis and therapy.OBJECTIVES: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x82The objective of this paper was to evaluate the management of suspected and/or diagnosed echinococcosis at a university center in a low-prevalence region.METHODS: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x82All the patients at the Leipzig University Hospital between 2004 and 2018 who had been serologically examined for echinococci were included in a retrospective cohort study. Clinical course, imaging, histology, therapeutic characteristics, relevant comorbidities and risk factors for AE and CE were evaluated. A time-staggered prevalence estimation, as well as sensitivity and specificity calculations for the serological tests, were performed.RESULTS: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x82A total of 382 patients were enrolled, with 11 AE and 7\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8aCE cases identified. The mean prevalence rate of AE in this cohort was 2.9\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a% and that of CE was 1.8\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a%. Among the patients, 56\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a% had known risk factors for AE and CE. The serological tests showed a sensitivity of 86\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a% and a specificity of 91\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a%. Two patients with false-negative serology were diagnosed by biopsy. All CE and 5 AE patients (45\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a%) were operated on. Six AE patients received long-term treatment with albendazole.CONCLUSIONS: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x82AE and CE are rare diseases in the greater Leipzig region; however, case numbers are on the rise. Due to favorable factors such as the escalation of migration, a further increase is expected. Diagnosis and therapy are challenging and should be supported by specialists (experienced infectiologists, imaging experts and skilled hepatobiliary surgeons) who should be integrated in a German network. labels: #Albendazole#Animals#Anthelmintics#Echinococcosis#Echinococcosis, Hepatic#Echinococcosis, Pulmonary#Echinococcus#Germany#Humans#Neglected Diseases#Prevalence#Retrospective Studies'
b"We describe a new species of rock-dwelling Gehyra Gray, 1834 (Gekkonidae) from the Einasleigh Uplands of inland north Queensland, Australia. Morphological, ecological, and molecular data clearly support the new species as distinct and place it within the 'australis group'. Gehyra electrum sp. nov. is distinguished from congeners by a combination of medium adult size (SVL 46-50 mm), an orange-brown to pinkish-orange background colouration with a pattern of distinct whitish spots and irregular black to purple-brown blotches or bars, possessing 7-8 undivided subdigital lamellae on the expanded portion of the fourth toe, and a wedge-shaped mental scale that separates the inner-postmental scales along 40% or more of their length. Gehyra electrum sp. nov. is a rock specialist currently known only from granite outcrops of the Mt Surprise region, Queensland. This is the second recently described Gehyra from the Einasleigh Uplands and adds to the growing number of endemic reptiles recognised in the region. labels: #Animal Distribution#Animal Structures#Animals#Australia#Body Size#Ecosystem#Lizards#Queensland"
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin in the skin lesions of patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc) and its effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human epidermal keratinocytes.METHODS: The expression of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin, Snail1 and E-cadherin in the skin lesions sample of 45 SSc patients and normal skin sample from 20 healthy adults was detected with SP immunohistochemistry. HaCaT, the human epidermal keratinocytes, were treated with different concentrations of Wnt10b (0 ng/mL (control), 2 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) for 48 h. then detected the localization of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin in HaCaT cells by immunofluorescence assay, determined the mRNA levels of Snail1 and Snail2 in HaCaT cells by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, detected the proteins expression of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin, Vimentin, N-cadherin and E-cadherin in HaCaT cells by Western blot.RESULTS: The positive rates of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin, Snail1 and E-cadherin in skin lesions of SSc patients were 100%, 88.89% and 2.22% respectively, while in healthy adult skin, the corresponding positive rates were 0%, 10.00%, and 95.00%. The difference between the two groups was significant. Compared with control group, treatment with different concentrations of Wnt10b (2 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) induced up-regulation of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin expression and promoted translocation of \\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin from cytoplasm to nucleus, increased the mRNA levels of Snail1 and Snail2 (P < 0.05), and up-regulated the proteins expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, down-regulated the E-cadherin protein expression in HaCaT cells (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally activated Wnt/\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin signaling pathway and abnormally expressed EMT-related proteins are observed in SSc lesions. Activation of Wnt/\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-catenin signaling pathway may promote EMT in HaCaT cells. labels: #Adult#Antigens, CD#Cadherins#Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition#Humans#Keratinocytes#Scleroderma, Systemic#Skin#Snail Family Transcription Factors#Vimentin#Wnt Signaling Pathway#beta Catenin'
b"RATIONALE: Castleman's disease (CD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease. Compared to unicentric CD, multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) displays poorer prognosis and great variance to different therapies. Though chemotherapy, immunization therapy, and glucocorticoids have been used in the treatment of MCD, its optimal treatment is still controversial.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old woman was admitted due to poor appetite, general fatigue, puffiness of face, systemic rash, and abdominal distension. On physical examination, the patient displayed as general lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and shifting dullness.DIAGNOSES: After biopsy of her swollen lymph node and laboratory tests, her initial diagnosis was hyaline vascular-CD.INTERVENTIONS: She was treated with combination of tocilizumab, lenalidomide, and glucocorticoids.OUTCOMES: This patient achieved complete remission (CR) with all her indexes returned to be normal. Her blood routines and biochemical examinations were still normal during the following period.LESSONS: We reported a case with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) which acquired quite good remission after combination treatment with tocilizumab, lenalidomide, and glucocorticoids. Our report provided powerful evidence for displaying the efficiency and safety of target therapy against unicentric Castleman disease. labels: #Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized#Castleman Disease#Drug Therapy, Combination#Female#Glucocorticoids#Humans#Immunologic Factors#Lenalidomide#Middle Aged#Treatment Outcome"
b'In order to achieve efficient recovery of ions from the simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification wastewater, the effects of various factors (i.e. the saturation temperature, the cooling termination temperature, the stirring rate and the cooling rate) on crystallization yield, metastable zone width and crystal morphology were investigated to determine the optimal crystallization conditions of Mg2+//SO42-, NO3--H2O system. According to the results of experiments, the nucleation kinetics were also speculated by N?vlt self-consistent equation and classical 3D nucleation theory. Also, the crystallization products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.

b"Objective: To investigate the clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hypertrophic port-wine stain (PWS). Methods: Cases of hypertrophic PWS, collected from Henan Provincial People's Hospital between 2012 and 2018, were retrospectively analyzed for their clinical and pathologic features, immunophenotype and histochemical data, and the relevant literature was reviewed. Results: Twenty-four cases of PWS were included in this cohort, located in the head and neck region (20 cases), limbs (2 cases), and trunk (2 cases). The clinical presentations were mainly red or purple-red plaques or slow growing, painless nodules, or thickened and raised above the skin surface. Microscopically, deformed blood vessels showed honeycomb-like, plexiform or cluster-like growth pattern, and diffusely involved the dermis, skin appendages, subcutaneous fat tissue, and deep skeletal muscles; The vascular lumen of the deformed vessels was dilated (?100 \\\\xc3\\\\xacm in diameter), and in 18 cases the lumen was greater than 400 \\\\xc3\\\\xacm. The superficial dermis mainly contained few deformed capillaries. The deep wall showed thickening of blood vessel wall and fibrous tissue hyperplasia. Elastic fiber and Masson staining indicated abnormal venous vessel, which in some cases contained small amount of abnormal arterioid vessel,without vascular endothelial cell proliferation in all cases. In 24 cases, 19 cases had epidermal atrophy, 6 with vascular chronic inflammation or epidermal ulcer, 4 with capillary hemangioma, 4 with sebaceous gland hyperplasia, 2 with epidermal papillary hyperplasia and 2 with vascular keratomas. Conclusions: PWS is a common congenital capillary malformation. The number of histologically deformed capillaries is reduced and they usually locate in the superficial part. The deep vascular wall is increased with thick venous malformation, diffusely involving the dermis and deep skeletal muscle. Furthermore, PWS needs to be differentiated from infantile hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma and vascular keratomas. labels: #Humans#Port-Wine Stain#Retrospective Studies#Skin"

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on behavioral changes, and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \\\\xc3\\\\xa1-synuclein(\\\\xc3\\\\xa1-syn), transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6) and transcription factor X box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) in the substantia nigra of Parkinson\\\\\\\'s disease (PD) rats, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of motor function.METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups (n=12 rats in each group). The PD model was established by subcutaneous injection of rotenone (2 mg/kg) at the neck and back, once a day for 28 days. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Fengfu" (GV16) and bilateral "Taichong" (LR3) for 20 min, once a day for 14 successive days. The voluntary motor behavioral changes (total distance, average speed, total movement time, total rest time in 8 min) were detected by open field tests. The immuno-activity of TH and \\\\xc3\\\\xa1-syn in the substantia nigra was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA detected by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR.RESULTS: Following modeling and compared with the control group, the total distance, average speed and total movement time of voluntary movement were significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the total rest time was significantly increased (P<0.01). Moreover, the expression of TH was significantly decreased (P<0.01), and that of \\\\xc3\\\\xa1-syn protein, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA significantly increased in the model group in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). After the intervention, the total distance, average speed, and total movement time of voluntary movement in the EA group were considerably higher than those in the model group (P<0.01), and the total rest time was obviously decreased in the EA group (P<0.01). The expression level of TH was significantly increased (P<0.01), and those of \\\\xc3\\\\xa1-syn, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA were notably decreased in the EA group compared with the model group (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: EA intervention can improve the locomotor function in PD model rats, which is associated with its functions in up-regulating the expression of TH protein and down-regulating the expression of \\\\xc3\\\\xa1-syn protein, and ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA in the substantia nigra of mesencephalon. labels: #Activating Transcription Factor 6#Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Parkinson Disease#RNA, Messenger#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Substantia Nigra#Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase#X-Box Binding Protein 1#alpha-Synuclein'
b'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the stress distribution of the mandibular first molar with different thicknesses and heights of the axial wall restored by the endocrown with two marginal designs and thus provide a theoretical basis for selecting clinical preparation through the finite-element method.METHODS: Two marginal endocrowns of the mandibular first molar with different axial-wall thicknesses (t=1, 2, 3 mm) and heights (h=2, 3, 4 mm) were established. Group A was the butt-joint design, whereas group B was the shoulder-surrounded design. After applying vertical and oblique loads , the size and distribution of the maximum principal stress and equivalent stress of residual tooth tissue were recorded.RESULTS: The maximum principal stress and equivalent stress distribution of residual tooth tissue were similar among different models. Group A showed a lower maximum principal stress and equivalent stress than group B at the same thickness and height under vertical load. Meanwhile, under oblique load, the maximum principal stress values of groups A and B decreased with increased thickness at constant height. Group A showed lower equivalent stress than group B at the same thickness and height of 2 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa83 mm. However, when the height was 4 mm, the trend was reversed.CONCLUSIONS: In mastication, when bearing the vertical force, the retention of the butt-joint marginal endocrown preferred to the shoulder-surrounded one. Given the higher axial wall of the shoulder-surrounded marginal endocrown, it showed better ability to bear the oblique force than the butt-joint one. labels: #Crowns#Dental Stress Analysis#Finite Element Analysis#Mastication#Molar'
b'Fluorescence image guided surgical resection (FIGR) of high grade gliomas (HGGs) takes advantage of the accumulation of the tracer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in glioma cells following administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). Occasionally, PpIX fluorescence intensity may be insufficient, thus compromising the efficacy and precision of the surgical intervention. The cause for the signal variation is unclear and strategies to improve the intensity of PpIX fluorescence are considered necessary. We have previously shown that differential expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor in glioblastoma cells affects PpIX fluorescence. Herein, we investigated other factors impairing PpIX accumulation and pharmacological treatments able to enhance PpIX fluorescence in glioblastoma cells displaying lower signal. In the present study we demonstrate that presence of serum in cell culture medium and differences in cellular confluence can negatively influence PpIX accumulation in U87 cell lines. We hypothesized that PpIX fluorescence intensity results from the interplay between the metabolic clearance of PpIX mediated by ferrochelatase and heme oxygenase-1 and the cellular efflux of PpIX through the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2). Based on the availability of compounds targeting these proteins and inhibiting them, in this study we used modulators such as genistein, an isoflavone able to inhibit ABCG2; deferoxamine, which chelate iron ions impairing FECH activity and tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), the specific HO-1 inhibitor. Finally, we showed the efficacy of a precisely tuned pharmacological treatment in increasing PpIX accumulation and consequently fluorescence in glioblastoma cells. This strategy may translate in more sensitive tracing of tumor cells in-vivo and improved FIGR of HGGs and possibly low grade gliomas (LGGs). labels: #ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2#Aminolevulinic Acid#Brain Neoplasms#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Proliferation#ErbB Receptors#Fluorescent Dyes#Genistein#Glioblastoma#Heme Oxygenase-1#Humans#Metalloporphyrins#Microscopy, Confocal#Neoplasm Proteins#Protoporphyrins'

b'Background Vitamin D deficiency is commonly identified in beta thalassemia major patients, related to iron accumulation.Vitamin D mediates its action upon binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR), a classical nuclear receptor. Several single nucleotide gene polymorphisms has been identified in VDR gene among which Bsml is commonly studied for its association with bone mineralisation and osteoporosis. Objective To explore the association between the Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphism (BsmI) and serum levels of Vitamin D, ionised Calcium, alkaline phosphatase in patients with beta thalassemia major. Method VDR gene was studied for Bsml polymorphisms from purified DNA in thirty six beta thalassemic patients (cases) - fourteen male and twenty two females, and thirty three controls after amplification by PCR followed by restriction digestion using appropriate restriction enzymes. Allelic differences between two groups were assessed by chi square and odds ratio test. Any potential link between the polymorphic variations and vitamin D status were assessed by post hoc ANOVA with bonferroni correction among the three genotypes. Result The distribution of BB genotype was significantly higher among the case groups (thalassemic group, \\\\xc3\\\\xb72 = 9.77, p= 0.008). The odds ratio for the allele B was significantly higher in thalassemia group for a range of 1.97 to 5.94 for 95 percent cofidence interval (\\\\xc3\\\\xb72 =10.4, p=0.0013). Serum Vitamin D, ionised Calcium were significantly low (p < 0.001) and Alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.001), was significantly high in thalassemics (cases). The genotype BB group had significantly low Vitamin D (p=0.001) and ionised Calcium (p < .001) compared to Bb and bb. The bb genotype had the highest levels of Vitamin D and ionised Calcium among the three genotypes. Conclusion The thalassemic patients are prone to Vitamin D deficiency and the superimposed predominance of BB genotype in them may be a risk factor for osteoporosis and cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, the study indicated genotype bb to have a probable protective role against Vitamin D deficiency in beta thalassemic patients. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Child, Preschool#Cross-Sectional Studies#DNA#Female#Genotype#Humans#Incidence#India#Male#Polymorphism, Genetic#Receptors, Calcitriol#Vitamin D#beta-Thalassemia'
b'Objective To explore the preliminary application of metabonomics in the qualitative diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods According to the pathological type, 201 patients with NSCLC were divided into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) group (n=71) and adenocarcinoma (AC) group (n=130). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of ki67, cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and CK7. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) was used to detect serum metabolomics. Results SCC group showed typical SCC structure; ki67 proliferation index was 21.9%; CK5/6 expression was positive; CK7 expression was negative or weakly positive. The typical adenoid structure was found in the AC group; the proliferation index of ki67 was 17.6%; CK7 was positive; and CK5/6 was negative or weakly positive. UPLC-Q/TOF-MS screened 28 different metabolites, of which 6 were the most significant ones: L-leucine, carnitine, C16 sphinganine, 13, 16, 19-docosatrienoic acie (DA), LysoPE (18:2/0:0), PC (20:4/P-16:0). These metabolites had good diagnostic value, among which L-Leucine had the highest specificity and LysoPE had the highest sensitivity.

b'PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The pilot study deals with the current situation in proximal femoral fractures in culturally diverse regions, namely in Afghanistan (AFG) and in the Czech Republic (CZ). The study aimed to find out whether there are any differences in proximal femoral fractures in dependence on the selected criteria between the two culturally diverse areas. The study used the data of patients who underwent surgery for proximal femoral fracture at the Department of Orthopaedics of the 1 s t Medical Faculty of the Charles University and the Military University Hospital and at the Military Base Hospital Kabul. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included patients aged 21 years or older who sustained a proximal femoral fracture in the period from October 2013 to February 2014. For the period concerned, the evaluation comprised 44 patients with a proximal femoral fracture from the Military Base Hospital Kabul, of whom 25 women and 19 men, and a total of 71 patients with a proximal femoral fracture from the Department of Orthopaedics of the 1st Medical Faculty of the Charles University and the Military University Hospital, of whom 43 women and 28 men. Based on the medical documentation, the following evaluation parameters were selected: age, sex, type of fracture. The data was processed using descriptive statistics, one-way and multifactorial analysis (ANOVA) and the POST-HOC test (Fisher LSD test, confidence interval = 95%) RESULTS The mean age of all the patients who suffered a fracture of proximal femur in AFG (58 years) was considerably lower (p < 0.001) than in patients in CZ (81 years). Similarly, a significant difference (p <0.001) was identified in the age of men and women treated for a proximal femoral fracture in both the countries. In AFG there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.002) between the age of men and women, where women sustaining fractures were younger (54 years) compared to men (63 years). In CZ no significant age difference was reported (83 years vs 78 years). In AFG, the observed fractures occurred generally in their 6th and 7th decade, whereas in CZ only in their 9th decade. The incidence of proximal femoral fractures in Afghan women is the highest in their 5th and 6th decade. Pertrochanteric fractures and intracapsular fractures prevailed in both countries. The lowest age in both types of the fracture was reported in Afghan women (52 years in femoral neck fracture, p <0.001, 54 years in trochanteric fracture, p = 0.039). DISCUSSION Significant differences between the patients in AFG and CZ concern several factors. Afghanistan is a country with the lowest average life expectancy. In the Afghan population a major Vitamin D deficiency was confirmed. This is related to the conservative dress code, especially in women, when the Vitamin D synthesis is suppressed. That can cause the occurrence of osteoporosis in women at a considerably younger age than in the population in the Czech Republic, which is subsequently accompanied by an increased incidence of proximal femoral fractures. Similar results, however, were also obtained in men. One of the risk factors of osteoporosis development is also low physical activity throughout the lifetime. This risk factor is significant primarily in female population in the Muslim world. Afghanistan also faces serious malnutrition. All of that is reflected in low life expectancy in the given country, incidence of osteoporosis and injuries in this region. There is reasonable evidence that the mortality in a causal relationship with proximal femoral fracture is substantially higher in this region than in Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS The results of the pilot study showed that there are significant differences in age and frequency of fractures in dependence on sex and country. The obtained results can be considered valuable since there are virtually no scientific or professional studies on osteoporosis and fractures in the given area that would help physicians get ready for significant differences. These results may become a source of valuable information not only for medical practitioners coming to Afghanistan to help as volunteers in the framework of developmental assistance from all over the world, but also for physicians from Europe, with respect to the wave of migrants coming from this area.

b'Objective: To explore the differences in epidemiology and clinical features of Guillain- Barr? syndrome (GBS) between rural and urban areas of southern China. Methods: The clinical data of 759 hospitalized GBS patients from 31 hospitals of 13 provinces/cities in southern China, between January 1st, 2013 and September 30th, 2016, were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: The risk of GBS was higher for males than females in rural and urban areas and the median age was 49 and 48 years, respectively. Seasonal clustering in winter and spring was noted in both rural and urban areas, and the seasonal trend was more markedly in rural areas, but the differences showed no statistical significance. There were 70.37% of patients in rural areas and 73.69% in urban areas who had antecedent respiratory infection. The median time from onset to nadir was 7 days, and Hughes Disability Scale at admission, nadir and discharge were (2.95\\\\xc2\\\\xb11.10 vs 2.84\\\\xc2\\\\xb11.15), (3.25\\\\xc2\\\\xb11.11 vs 3.14\\\\xc2\\\\xb11.21), (2.02\\\\xc2\\\\xb11.24 vs 2.00\\\\xc2\\\\xb11.31) in rural and urban areas respectively. Albuminocytologic dissociation was present in 84.34% of patients in rural areas and 84.62% of cases in urban areas. There were 8.65% and 10.94% of cases in rural and urban areas who required mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, respectively. Demyelinating GBS accounted for 53.29% and 48.77%, respectively, in patients with findings of nerve conduction studies available in rural and urban areas. Conclusions: GBS in rural areas of southern China showed male predominance and a peak of spring and winter occurrence, with respiratory infection as the predominated preceding events and demyelinating GBS being main clinical subtype. Winter and spring showed a higher incidence of GBS in rural and urban areas. There were no significant differences of sex, age, preceding events, season trend, progression of disease, clinical subtypes and cerebrospinal fluid investigations in GBS patients between rural and urban areas. labels: #China#Female#Guillain-Barre Syndrome#Hospitalization#Humans#Incidence#Male#Retrospective Studies'

b'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of triclosan-coated suture for the reduction of infection in saphenectomy wounds of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.METHODS: A total of 508 patients who underwent saphenectomy in CABG surgery were included in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial from February/2011 to June/2014. Patients were randomized into the triclosan-coated suture group (n= 251) and the conventional non-antibiotic suture group (n=257). Demographic (gender and age), clinical (body mass index, diabetes, and use of analgesics), and intraoperative (cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times) variables and those related to the saphenectomy wound (pain, dehiscence, erythema, infection, necrosis, and hyperthermia) were measured and analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 508 patients who underwent saphenectomy, 69.9% were males and 40.2% were diabetic. Thirty-three (6.5%) patients presented infection: 13 (5.3%) with triclosan and 20 (7.9%) with conventional suture (P=0.281). Among diabetic patients (n=204), triclosan suture was used in 45.1% with four cases of infection; conventional suture was used in 54.9% of them, with 11 cases of infection. Most patients (94.3%) underwent on-pump CABG. Wound pain was observed in 9.9% of patients with triclosan-coated suture and in 17.9% with conventional suture (P=0.011). Wound hyperthermia was found in 1.6% of patients with triclosan-coated suture and in 5.4% of those with conventional suture (P=0.028).CONCLUSION: Triclosan-coated suture shows lower infection rate in saphenectomy of patients undergoing CABG, although the differences were not statistically significant. Pain and wound hyperthermia were less frequent in patients with triclosan-coated sutures compared with conventional sutures. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Anti-Infective Agents, Local#Body Mass Index#Coronary Artery Bypass#Diabetes Complications#Double-Blind Method#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Pain, Postoperative#Polyglactin 910#Prospective Studies#Reproducibility of Results#Saphenous Vein#Statistics, Nonparametric#Surgical Wound Infection#Suture Techniques#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome#Triclosan'

For the Afro-Caribbean skin tone, Type III dental stone demonstrated the greatest colour change (\\\\xc3\\\\x84\\\\xc3\\\\x85 = 4.36), whereas, for the Caucasian skin tone, it was the Type II dental stone (\\\\xc3\\\\x84\\\\xc3\\\\x85 = 2.21).CONCLUSION: This study showed that regardless of the investing material, the colour of the silicone lightens after polymerisation. Both types of dental stone resulted in visible colour changes, with a \\\\xc3\\\\x84\\\\xc3\\\\x85 ranging from 1.64 - 4.36. labels: #Caribbean Region#Color#Materials Testing#Maxillofacial Prosthesis#Silicone Elastomers#Skin Pigmentation'
b'Severe restriction of airway volume in the orofacial region, caused by temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, may lead to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If the TMJ ankylosis is progressive, rarely, the caregivers may fail to notice the problem. Such patients may have only symptoms of snoring, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, inability to concentrate, and irritability. At times, emergency tracheostomy may be needed to increase the oxygen supply. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a less invasive surgical technique in the management of such OSA by correcting the reduced airway space. In DO, the angulation of the distractors and the pace of activation determine the success of the neo-generation of segments of bone. The formation of a well-corticated mandibular canal (MC) in the newly generated bone is an evidence of the success of the procedure. Such bilateral formation of the MC is not reported from this part of the world. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy who was struggling with OSA due to TMJ ankylosis. He was successfully treated by bilateral mandibular DO. The formation and cortication of the MC is discussed with emphasis on the neural regeneration. labels: #Ankylosis#Child, Preschool#Humans#Male#Mandible#Micrognathism#Osteogenesis, Distraction#Sleep Apnea Syndromes#Tracheostomy'

b'INTRODUCTION: True arterial aneurysms of the upper limb are rare and their treatment is intended to avoid complications as distal embolization, compression of surrounding neurovascular structures or rupture.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to review the experience of a department in the surgical treatment of true arterial aneurysms of the upper limb.METHODS: A retrospective study was performed between January 2007 and August 2017.RESULTS: From a total of eleven patients, nine were male and two were female. One of the patients had surgery twice because of two consecutive aneurysms of the upper limb. From a total of twelve cases, two were subclavian, one was axillary and nine were brachial aneurysms. Three of them had degenerative/idiopathic aetiology, one was associated to a cervical rib and seven occurred in the setting of arteriovenous fistula or kidney graft. Five patients had emergent surgery and the others had elective surgery. All of the patients were submitted to aneurysmectomy. As 30-day complications, there were two haematomas, one compartment syndrome and two early graft occlusions. Four patients needed re-intervention. During the follow-up period, all the grafts initially preserved were patent. There were no further known complications or amputation procedures.CONCLUSION: In this review most of the aneurysms were found in patients with haemodialysis vascular access or kidney grafts. Despite the need for early re-intervention in some cases, the surgical treatment of true arterial aneurysms of the upper limb is a low morbidity procedure. labels: #Aneurysm#Female#Humans#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Kidney Transplantation#Male#Peripheral Arterial Disease#Renal Dialysis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Upper Extremity'
b'Prolachlanius\\\\xc2\\\\xa0resinatus (Hagen) is re-described, based on five specimens from late Eocene Baltic amber (including the neotype designated herein) and the first recorded specimen from contemporaneous Rovno amber (Klesov locality). This is the most common species of Hemerobiidae in Baltic amber. The forewing venation of Prolachlanius is most similar to that of Sympherobius, and, therefore, its assignment to Sympherobiinae is confirmed. The genus differs from other Sympherobiinae by the distal branch of RP being not deeply forked, and the presence of crossvein 4r-m in the forewing. The male genitalia of Prolachlanius are sufficiently dissimilar from those of other Sympherobiinae to distinguish it as a separate genus, particularly by the structure of the ectoprocts, and the 8th and 9th sternites. The extremely short eighth sternite of Prolachlanius is especially noteworthy. labels: #Amber#Animals#Baltic States#Fossils#Holometabola#Male'

b'A review of female mutillids in southern Thailand is presented, based on literature, loaned material, and two field expeditions. Thirty-three species in 23 genera have been previously recorded from Thailand (Lelej 2005; Lelej et al. 2016, 2017; Okayasu et al. 2018). In March and April 2017, 337 female specimens were collected in the provinces of Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, Songkhla, and Trang. In May 2018, 255 female specimens were collected in the provinces of Kanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, and Surat Thani. These collected specimens were sorted into 38 morphospecies: 13 already known from Thailand, nine previously described species newly recorded from Thailand, and 16 new to science and described here. Based on loaned material, three more described species were newly recorded from southern Thailand and one more undescribed species was found. Keys to females of the 31 mutillid genera found in southeast Asia and 42 mutillid species studied from southern Thailand are provided. Illustrations and diagnoses are provided for each species studied in southern Thailand, including the following 17 new species: Bischoffitilla tokay Williams, Bischoffitilla cambrai Williams, Mickelomyrme puttasoki Williams, Mickelomyrme kinguri Williams, Nordeniella maleeae Williams, Smicromyrme helarctos Williams, Smicromyrme borkenti Williams, Smicromyrme thaochani Williams, Krombeinidia agricola Williams, Krombeinidia chang Williams, Krombeinidia baanmaka Williams, Orientidia manleyi Williams, Orientidia thoawanae Williams, Petersenidia modkhong Williams, Petersenidia leleji Williams, Trogaspidia pittsi Williams, and Trogaspidia wilsoni Williams. Three new synonyms and one new combination are recognized: Bischoffitilla lamellata (Mickel, 1933) = Squamulotilla arundinacea Pagden, 1934, syn. nov., Mickelomyrme pusillaeformis (Hammer, 1962), comb. nov. = Mickelomyrme yunnanensis Lelej, 1996, syn. nov., Trogaspidia pagdeni (Mickel, 1933) = Timulla (Trogaspidia) pagdeni nodoa Mickel, 1933, syn. nov.

b'OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of PR-957 on the formation of A1 reactive astrocytes.METHODS: The cerebral cortices of 1-day-old female rats were obtained and cultured for primary astrocytes. These cells were divided into 3 groups: control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LPS+PR-957. The LPS group was treated with LPS (at a concentration of 5 \\\\xc3\\\\xacmol/L) for 48 hours; the LPS+PR-957 group was treated with PR-957 (at a final concentration of 200 nmol/L) for 1 hour and then LPS for 48 hours. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the expression of complement 3 (C3, a marker for A1 reactive astrocytes) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa1). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the relative mRNA expression of glypican-6 (GPC6), SPARC-like 1 (SPARCL1), and lipocalin-2 (LCN2). All the above experiments were repeated three times independently.RESULTS: C3 expression was almost not observed in the control group, but was observed in both the LPS group and the LPS+PR-957 group, with significantly lower expression observed in the LPS+PR-957 group (P<0.05). The expression of TNF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa1 was consistent with that of C3. Compared with the control group, the LPS and the PS+PR-957 groups had significantly reduced mRNA expression levels of GPC6 and SPARCL1 but significantly increased mRNA expression level of LCN2 (P<0.001). Compared with the LPS group, the LPS+PR-957 group had significantly increased mRNA expression levels of GPC6 and SPARCL1 but significantly reduced mRNA expression level of LCN2 (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: LPS can induce the transformation from astrocytes to A1 reactive astrocytes, and PR-957 can inhibit the formation of LPS-induced A1 reactive astrocytes. labels: #Animals#Astrocytes#Female#Lipopolysaccharides#Oligopeptides#Rats#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha'
b'Current methods of biofilm imaging do not support a differentiated assessment of its composition, since it is not possible to establish a substrate stained with crystal violet, as this dye can form complexes with both intracellular and extracellular structures. This approach does not adequately assess the anti-biofilm effects of drugs, while the results of studying the interaction of drugs with biofilm components can ensure their most correct choice. The aim of investigation was to study the possibility of applying the original modification of the current method to determine the ratio of the cellular part and the matrix of biofilms of gram-positive microorganisms. The biofilm components were analyzed using a two-step approach, when prepared biofilms of gram-positive microorganisms were stained with crystal violet for 5 minutes, followed by fixing the dye in bacterial cells with iodine solution, and then the colored products were dissolved with 95% alcohol: matrix components for 1 minute, total biofilm for 15 minutes, after which the composition of biofilms was estimated by the formula: M=(OP1/OP15)?100, Kb=100-M, where M is the proportion of the matrix,%; Kb - the proportion of the cellular component,%; OP1 - optical density of samples, when alcohol was allowed to dissolve the colored product for no more than 1 minute; OP15 - was the optical density of samples, when alcohol is allowed to dissolve the colored product for 15 minutes. It was shown that in the composition of the biofilm formed by the collection strain, the proportion of the matrix was 13.2%, and the cellular component accounted for 86.8%. When the same strain cultivated in the presence of an antibiotic, an increase in the biofilm matrix was observed, which is probably due to the compensatory response of the microorganism to the action of the antibiotic. The proposed approach to the study of biofilms makes it possible to evaluate its component composition. Obtaining additional information in this way can provide, inter alia, an increase in the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy while reducing the study time. labels: #Biofilms#Gram-Positive Bacteria#Staining and Labeling'
b'An 83-year-old woman visited our hospital with a mass on her right breast mass. Breast ultrasonography revealed a tumorous lesion approximately 30mm in diameter in the right E region. Fibrous tumor was suspected from core needle biopsy. Since surgery for definite diagnosis was not desired, she was followed. Seven months after the first visit, skin redness, pain, and rapid increase in tumor size was consciously recognized, which prompted a reconsultation. The tumor diameter rapidly increased to 74 mm, and a total right mastectomy was performed as a semi-emergency procedure. Necrotic and hemorrhagic lesions were mixed in a mottled state in the cleaved surface of the excised specimen, and the pathological diagnosis was stromal sarcoma mainly comprising of fibrosarcoma components. Stromal sarcoma of the breast lacks the epithelial component of a malignant phyllodes tumor, and effective systemic therapy has not been established; therefore, cases with local recurrence or distant metastasis result in poor prognosis. Since we encountered a case of stromal sarcoma of the breast that showed a rapid increase after several months, we will provide a report with some literature consideration. labels: #Aged, 80 and over#Breast Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Mastectomy#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Phyllodes Tumor'
b'Bilateral nephrolithiasis with a concurrent vaginal calculus was identified in a stranded free-ranging long-beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis. Necropsy and radiologic examinations of the sexually mature D. capensis revealed multiple small irregularly round nephroliths and a 6.4 ? 4.1 ? 9.2 cm vaginal calculus weighing 182 g. Nephroliths numbered 68 and 71 in the left and right kidneys, respectively, and ranged from 1.7 to 6.9 mm in diameter. Nephroliths were composed of 100% ammonium urate, which has been found in captive dolphin populations. However, the vaginolith consisted of struvite and calcium carbonate suggesting an alternate etiology. The composition of the vaginolith suggests that bacterial vaginitis could have served as the predisposing condition. Renal lesions included chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with tubular degeneration and loss, likely secondary to the nephroliths. The pathogenesis of ammonium urate nephrolithiasis in managed care is suspected to be linked to diet and age but in this case may be due to metabolic disruption. However, if environmental changes cause a shift in prey species, the risk of nephrolithiasis in free-ranging cetaceans could increase. Careful surveillance for nephroliths in free-ranging populations should be considered by researchers. labels: #Animals#Calculi#Common Dolphins#Female#Kidney#Nephrolithiasis#Vagina'
b'Four controversial types of simplex reinforcing-reducing manipulation of acupuncture and their possible meanings were summarized to explore several key elements of reinforcing-reducing manipulation of acupuncture, in addition, the simplex reinforcing-reducing manipulation of acupuncture was classified by single factor.

b'After comparing specimens of Vanmanenia collected from the Lancang-jiang (the upper Mekong River), Yuan-jiang (the upper Red River), Lixian-jiang (first branch of the Red River), and Jinsha-jiang (the upper Yangtze River) drainages in Yunnan, China, we considered the specimens of Vanmanenia from Shunbi Township, Yangbi County, Yunnan (a branch of the Lancang-jiang drainage basin, the upper Mekong River) a new species, herein named V. microcephala sp. nov. Our investigation also suggested that V. striata should be restored as a valid species. On the basis of the systematic comparison of morphological characteristics of the genus Vanmanenia and based on the combination of the characteristics of the rostral fold, rostral barbels, the bars/marks on the flank, the rows of spots on the paired fins, and the markings on the caudal-fin base, the loaches of Vanmanenia should be divided into three groups: 1) the barred group, characterized by bars on the flank, 2), the cusped rostral fold group, characterized by the rostral fold lobes forming a cusp process, and 3) the barbeled rostral fold group, characterized by the rostral fold lobes specialized as secondary barbels. The barred group differs from congeners in Vanmanenia by the following combination of characters: three rostral lobes with a smooth and arcuate outer edge, a pattern of bars on the flank, and spotless paired fins. This group includes six species: V. crassicauda, V. microcephala sp. nov., V. serrilineata, V. striata, V. tetraloba, and Vanmanenia pseudostriata. The new species, V. microcephala, differs from the other species in the barred group by the following combination of characters: the lateral side of the body with 14-22 vermiculations with widths smaller than the diameter of the eye; the dorsal side of the head covered with a large black blotch; the gill opening smaller and its upper angle aligned with the lower edge of the eye; and the head smaller, head depth 45.2-47.1% head length.

b'CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and public health and clinical stakeholders are investigating a nationwide outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) (1). CDC has published recommendations for health care providers regarding EVALI (2-4). Recently, researchers from Utah and New York published proposed diagnosis and treatment algorithms for EVALI (5,6). EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion because, at present, no specific test or marker exists for its diagnosis, and evaluation should be guided by clinical judgment. Because patients with EVALI can experience symptoms similar to those associated with influenza or other respiratory infections (e.g., fever, cough, headache, myalgias, or fatigue), it might be difficult to differentiate EVALI from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia on initial assessment; EVALI might also co-occur with respiratory infections. This report summarizes recommendations for health care providers managing patients with suspected or known EVALI when respiratory infections such as influenza are more prevalent in the community than they have been in recent months (7). Recommendations include 1) asking patients with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms about the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products; 2) evaluating those suspected to have EVALI with pulse oximetry and obtaining chest imaging, as clinically indicated; 3) considering outpatient management for clinically stable EVALI patients who meet certain criteria; 4) testing patients for influenza, particularly during influenza season, and administering antimicrobials, including antivirals, in accordance with established guidelines; 5) using caution when considering prescribing corticosteroids for outpatients, because this treatment modality has not been well studied among outpatients, and corticosteroids could worsen respiratory infections; 6) recommending evidence-based treatment strategies, including behavioral counseling, to help patients discontinue using e-cigarette, or vaping, products; and 7) emphasizing the importance of annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ?6 months, including patients who use e-cigarette, or vaping products. labels: #Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.#Disease Outbreaks#Humans#Lung Injury#Practice Guidelines as Topic#United States#Vaping'
b"OBJECTIVE: We provided baseline data for oral public health through epidemiological surveys to investigate the prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment proportion in 12- to 14-year-old adolescents in Jiangxi province, China.METHODS: Multi-stage random cluster sampling was used. A total of 5 387 12- to 14-year-old adolescents were examined by three professional dentists according to Angle's classification of malocclusion. The subjects were recruited from 30 secondary schools in five counties in Jiangxi Province. Results were statistically analyzed by SPSS19.0.RESULTS: The prevalence of malocclusion was 79.67% among adolescents aged 12-14 years in Jiangxi province. The composition ratios of Class?, Class ? Division 1, Class ? Division 2, and Class ? malocclusion were 30.96%, 16.36%, 12.78%, and 19.13% respectively. Class?malocclusion had the highest composition ratio, and the most common clinical manifestation of malocclusion was dentition crowding with a prevalence of 91.30%. The prevalence rate of malocclusion was higher in boys than in girls at 81.16% and 78.21%, respectively (P<0.05). This condition had different prevalence rates in Nanchang, Yichun, Jiujiang, Shangrao, and Ganzhou (P<0.05) with the highest in Nanchang and lowest in Ganzhou. Malocclusion was related to caries, and its prevalence rate was higher in patients with caries than in those without caries (P<0.05). The orthodontic rate of malocclusion was 2.63%, and the value was higher for girls than that for boys (P<0.05). The rate of orthodontic in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Compared with local and international findings on malocclusion of adolescents, high prevalence and low orthodontic rate were found in Jiangxi province. Strengthening the combination of prevention and treatment is important for the physical and mental health of adolescents. We should actively conduct oral health education, popularize the knowledge of malocclusion, and actively treat caries. labels: #Adolescent#Child#China#Dental Caries#Epidemiologic Studies#Female#Humans#Male#Malocclusion#Prevalence"

b"PURPOSE: To evaluate preterm infants' exposure and reactions to intense noise during incubator care.METHODS: An observational and prospective study was performed in the intermediary care unit of a hospital in Ribeir?o Preto (SP). Thirty-five preterm infants participated in the first stage of the study (measuring noise) and 20 in the second (analysis of responses to intense noise). Noise was measured for two hours using a dosimeter, and the responses were video recorded by three cameras connected to a computer. The preterm infants' responses to an Lmax higher than 65 decibels were analyzed.RESULTS: Every preterm infant presented Leq above the limit recommended by international organizations, and more than half of the babies had a mean Leq above the limit permitted by the Brazilian standard. Regarding the babies' responses to the intense noise, the majority of them showed blink reflex, startle reflex, facial mimics, changed bodily activities or changed sleep and wake state, all with statistically significant differences.CONCLUSION: The sound levels measured were intense. The noises that preterm infants are exposed to while being cared for in incubators constitute a stressor event. Sudden, intense noises change their behavioral state and causes reflexive and bodily responses, facial manifestations and changes in their sleep and wake state. labels: #Female#Humans#Incubators, Infant#Infant, Newborn#Infant, Premature#Intensive Care Units, Neonatal#Male#Noise#Prospective Studies"

b'Introduction: The Pan-European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management was conceived in 2013 to monitor eradication practices in Europe for 10 years. Aim: To assess the efficacy of different eradication regimens in a single outpatient clinic of gastroenterology. Method: Between 2013 and 2019, 247 patients were registered in a prospective non-interventional study. The infection was diagnosed either by endoscopy, histology, rapid urease test or 13C-urea breath test. As first-line treatment, the patients received either a 7-day triple regimen (any of PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin or tinidazole), 10-day modified sequential treatment (PPI + amoxicillin for 5 days + tinidazole and levofloxacin for 5 days), 10-day quadruple concomitant treatment (PPI + amoxicillin + tetracycline or doxycycline + metronidazole or tinidazole) or bismuth-based quadruple treatment. Bismuth or non-bismuth based quadruple or alternative regimens were given as second- or third-line treatment. Results: The eradication rates on per protocol basis were: 82.7% (95% confidence interval: 68.1-97.4) (first-line regimens), 85.2% (75.4-94.9) (sequential treatment), 95.1% (89.6-100) (concomitant treatment) and 82.6% (69.7-95.9) (bismuth-based quadruple regimen). Second-line regimens achieved 65.2% (48.2-83.0) and third-line therapy 54.5% (19.4-86.6), respectively. Conclusion: The first-line concomitant regimen was superior to triple and not significantly better than the sequential or bismuth-based treatment. Second- and third-line regimens achieved largely suboptimal results.

b'OBJECTIVE: Spinal epidural fibrosis is commonly seen after laminectomy. There is not yet proven any agent preventing fibrosis in clinical usage. We used diclofenac sodium and diltiazem, which are fibrosis inhibitors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: 40 rats were divided into four groups of equal numbers: control, diclofenac sodium, diltiazem, and diclofenac sodium + diltiazem. Laminectomies were performed at L5 and L6. After a 4 week period, the rats were decapitated and the vertebral column blocks were removed for histopathologic examination. Fibrosis percentage, spread of fibrous regions, and fibroblast numbers were evaluated in each group and compared between the groups.RESULTS: The distribution of epidural fibrosis density, percentage of fibrosis, and distribution of fibroblasts in the diclofenac sodium + diltiazem group were significantly lower than in the other groups. The fibroblast numbers of the diltiazem, and diclofenac sodium + diltiazem groups were significantly lower than in the other groups.CONCLUSION: Diclofenac sodium + diltiazem used together provided better outcomes because each of them prevented fibrosis via different ways, probably through synergistic action (Tab. 5, Fig. 3, Ref. 43). labels: #Animals#Diclofenac#Diltiazem#Epidural Space#Fibrosis#Laminectomy#Rats'

b'A man in his late 40s was presented to a hospital with complaints of peripheral numbness and fatigue. Systemic edema, pleural effusion and ascites, pigmentation, splenomegaly, and CT findings of osteoplastic changes suggested POEMS syndrome. He was referred to our division, and a bone marrow examination indicated MGUS. However, his serum level of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)was elevated to 1,520 pg/mL, and IgA-l type M protein was detected. He was diagnosed with POEMS syndrome and received four cycles of induction chemotherapy containing lenalidomide and dexamethasone( Ld). All symptoms improved gradually, and after auto peripheral blood stem cell harvest(aPBSCH), high-dose melphalan was administered, followed by auto peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(aPBSCT)being performed. Pleural effusion and ascites disappeared, while numbness remained slightly. His serum level of VEGF decreased to 68 pg/mL when the planned primary treatment was completed. Many cases of POEMS syndrome involve peripheral neuropathy; therefore, a lenalidomide-containing regimen may be a more adequate strategy than ones containing thalidomide and bortezomib. labels: #Humans#Male#POEMS Syndrome#Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation#Thalidomide#Transplantation, Autologous#Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A'
b'OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare gadobutrol-enhanced gradient-echo sequence (GRE) acquisition with T2-prepared non-contrast-enhanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) in coronary magnetic resonance angiography at 1.5 T.METHODS: Twenty-one subjects successfully completed GRE and SSFP acquisition. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio, image quality, sharpness, visibility, length, and lumen diameter of vessels were analyzed by 2 experienced radiologists.RESULTS: The SNR at whole left circumflex artery, left main artery, and proximal left descending artery (LAD) was significantly higher in SSFP acquisition (P < 0.05). The SNR of distal LAD was slightly higher in GRE acquisition (P < 0.05). The contrast-to-noise ratio at distal LAD, proximal and distal RCA were significantly higher with GRE acquisition (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Double-dose gadobutrol-enhanced GRE and unenhanced SSFP coronary magnetic resonance angiography at 1.5 T have their own characteristics, and the combined use of the 2 methods may be taken into consideration. labels: #Adult#Coronary Artery Disease#Female#Humans#Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted#Image Processing, Computer-Assisted#Imaging, Three-Dimensional#Magnetic Resonance Angiography#Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine#Male#Middle Aged#Organometallic Compounds#Respiration#Signal-To-Noise Ratio'
b'Specimens of a limnoterrestrial tardigrade collected from moss in New Hampshire, USA and Newfoundland, Canada were identified as belonging to the genus Milnesium. Morphometric data and genetic analysis of the COI gene demonstrated that animals collected from these sites represent the same species. Specimens most closely resemble Milnesium granulatum, a South American species that has been reported also from Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), USA. New Hampshire and Newfoundland animals have the same adult claw configuration and cuticular granulation pattern as M. granulatum. Theira* (i.e., normalized to correct for allometric effects) pt values differ from GSMNP M. granulatum in having a more posterior stylet support insertion point. However, all their morphometric values overlap in range with GSMNP specimens. Unlike some other species in the genus, the claw configuration of New Hampshire Milnesium cf. granulatum shows no ontogenetic change in claw configuration. A short (269 bp on average) fragment of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS-2) was sequenced for 20 New Hampshire adults and from siblings hatched in the laboratory from 8 egg clutches. Genetic diversity among New Hampshire adults was 0.0-3.7%. Multiple haplotypes were found between siblings in a single clutch. labels: #Animals#Bryophyta#Canada#Newfoundland and Labrador#Parks, Recreational#Tardigrada'
b'Epithelial cells and functions of the epithelium are critical to the health of the oral cavity. We used a nonhuman primate model to profile the transcriptome of gingival tissues in health across the lifespan and hypothesized that in older animals, epithelial-related transcriptome patterns would reflect epithelial cells that are aggressively responsive to the surrounding environment and less able to modulate and resolve the noxious challenge from the bacteria. Rhesus monkeys (n\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa034) with a healthy periodontium were distributed into four groups: ?3\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years (young), 3-7\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years (adolescent), 12-16\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years (adult), and 18-23\\\\xc2\\\\xa0years (aged), and a buccal gingival sample from the premolar/molar region of each animal was obtained. RNA was subjected to a microarray analysis (GeneChip\\\\xc2\\\\xae Rhesus Macaque Genome Array, Affymetrix), and 336 genes examined that are linked to epithelium and epithelial cell functions categorized into 9 broad functional groups: extracellular matrix and cell structure; extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes; cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeleton regulation; inflammatory response; growth factors; kinases/cell signaling; cell surface receptors; junction associated molecules; autophagy/apoptosis; antimicrobial peptides; and transcription factors. Total of 255 genes displayed a normalized signal >100, and differences across the age groups were observed primarily in extracellular matrix and cell structure, cell adhesion molecules, and cell surface receptor gene categories with elevations in the aged tissues. Keratins 2, 5, 6B, 13, 16, 17 were all significantly increased in healthy-aged tissues versus adults, and keratins 1 and 2 were significantly decreased in young animals. Approximately 15 integrins are highly expressed in the gingival tissues across the age groups with only ITGA8, ITGAM (CD11b), and ITGB2 significantly increased in the aged tissues. Little impact of aging on desmosomal/hemidesmosomal genes was noted. These results suggest that healthy gingival aging has a relatively limited impact on the broader functions of the epithelium and epithelial cells, with some effects on genes for extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules (e.g., integrins). Thus, while there is a substantial impact of aging on immune system targets even in healthy gingiva, it appears that the epithelial barrier remains reasonably molecularly intact in this model system. labels: #Aging#Animals#Disease Models, Animal#Epithelial Cells#Gingiva#Macaca mulatta#Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis#Transcriptome'
b'Sycoracinae is a subfamily of Psychodidae, currently with 45 extant species (Curler Jacobson 2012; Santos et al. 2013) classified in three genera: Sycorax Haliday in Curtis; Parasycorax Duckhouse and Aposycorax Duckhouse (Duckhouse 1972; Young 1979). Sycorax comprises a majority of this diversity with 40 extant species, 15 of which are recorded from the Neotropical region (Curler Jacobson 2012; Santos et al. 2013). Four fossil species of Sycorax have also been described (Curler Jacobson 2012), including one from middle Miocene Amazonian amber (Petrulevi?ius et al. 2011). In contrast, Parasycorax includes only four extant species; three from South America and one from the Philippines (Santos et al. 2009) and a fossil species from Cretaceous Burmese amber (Stebner et al. 2015). Here we describe a new species of Parasycorax and provide an updated key to males of all extant and fossil species of the genus. In addition, Sycorax bravoi Santos, Ferreira Falqueto and Sycorax espiritosantensis Santos Bravo are recorded for Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. labels: #Amber#Animals#Brazil#Fossils#Male#Philippines#Psychodidae'
b'PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Osteoporotic hip fractures commonly associated with comorbid diseases and use of multiple drugs. Polypharmacy status and the comorbidity-polypharmacy score (CPS) are the most common two grading system to predict mortality risk for the trauma patients older than 45 years. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the CPS or polypharmacy can predict the mortality risk in the older patients had a surgery due to an osteoporotic hip fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS Consecutive patients aged > 65 years had an osteoporotic hip fracture due to a simple trauma were enrolled in the study. Detailed data were collected included comorbid conditions, medications, T-scores and additional fractures. Patients were divided into four groups according to CPS classification and polypharmacy status was indicated in case of using five or more drugs before admission. Overall mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival testing. Factors influencing 1-year, 2-year and 5-year mortality were evaluated using a multivariate logistic regression model with adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and a threshold significance at p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 109 patients (65% women) with a mean age 80 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 8.06 were included in the study. The mean time to death from the surgery was 42.06 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 34.9 months. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significant difference in mortality among CPS groups. (Log-Rank test < 0.001). CPS presented a significant prediction in 1-year (AOR: 4.2; p < 0.05) and 2-year mortality (AOR: 2.9; p < 0.05) after adjustment for several covariates (including age, gender, surgical procedure) whereas 5-year mortality did not reveal a significant prediction (p = 0.46) Polypharmacy existence did not independently predict both overall or year-based mortality (p > 0.05) . CONCLUSIONS CPS is a better predictor for mortality risk than polypharmacy existence in the first two years in the patients underwent surgery for an osteoporotic hip fracture.

b"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the transition-to-practice experience of new-graduate nurses (NGNs) in long-term-care (LTC) settings.BACKGROUND: Transitioning to professional practice is a challenging time for an NGN. This experience is scarcely described for RNs outside of acute care settings and not described for the LPN.METHODS: A qualitative case study was used to explore the described transition-to-practice experience of new-graduate RNs and LPNs in LTC.RESULTS: This study revealed that the transition-to-practice experience of new-graduate LPNs was similar to the experience described by RNs. Differences in experience were related to leadership roles in the setting.CONCLUSIONS: Findings contribute to new understanding of the experience of the NGN in LTC settings. This study reinforces the need for greater support for nursing graduates in this setting. labels: #Adult#Female#Humans#Licensed Practical Nurses#Long-Term Care#Male#Middle Aged#Nurse's Role#Nurses#Nursing, Practical#Qualitative Research"
b'The re-examination of nematodes collected decades ago from a spiny rat, Proechimys roberti (Echimyidae) from Par? State, revealed the presence of Acanthostrongylus acanthostrongylus Travassos, 1937, and two coparasitic species of Pudica (Heligmonellidae: Pudicinae), one of them new to science. Pudica minima n. sp. mostly resembles Pudica tenua Durette-Desset, 1970, described from Proechimys semispinosus in Colombia. Nevertheless, it differs from P. tenua by having a synlophe with 12 ridges with poorly developed careen, bursal pattern of type 2-2-1 on the right lobe, bursal rays 2 and 3 similar in length, and spicules longer with spoon-shaped tips. Pudica evandroi (Travassos, 1937) was already described from Pr. roberti but its synlophe remained undescribed and the original description lacked some details. A detailed study of the synlophe is provided and the range of morphometric data for males and females is enlarged. The study of the synlophe allowed ratifying the placement of this species within Pudica, as early suggested by previous authors. The species list and identification key to species of Pudica are updated with the inclusion of three species. The status of Heligmosomum alpha Travassos, 1918, which was transferred to Pudica in 1990, is emended and the species is considered a Nippostrongylinae incertae sedis. labels: #Animals#Brazil#Female#Male#Nematoda#Rodentia'
b"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In the Czech Republic a systematic neonatal hip screening has been performed for many decades. Its aim is to prevent, by means of early treatment of hip dysplasia in the newborn period, the development of hip deformities leading to the onset of degenerative hip changes during the adulthood. The study aims to prove the effects of paediatric hip care based on the data analysis of the Czech National Register of Joint Replacement. MATERIAL AND METHODS The National Register of Joint Replacement comprises information on implantation of hip arthroplasties performed over the period of last 15 years, while the screening has been carried out for almost 60 years. An analysis of the patients' data from the register was conducted; the data was sorted by the diagnosis leading to surgery in individual age categories and individual years. The obtained data was correlated with the systems of newborn hip screening at the time when the treated generations of patients were born. RESULTS According to the National Register of Joint Replacement, in the period 2003-2017 a total of 174,515 primary hip joint replacements were performed, 345 total hip arthroplasties (0.19 %) were implanted for complete hip dislocation in dysplasia, 14,139 replacements (8.10%) were performed for postdysplastic hip degeneration. By comparing the periods 2005-2007 and 2015-2017 a decrease almost to a half of the number of implanted endoprostheses for hip dislocation was identified. Moreover, only 8 of 345 dislocated hips in the Register were managed by joint replacement in patients who were born during the systematic screening period. The percentage of endoprostheses implanted for postdysplastic degeneration decreased respectively; in 2005-2007 period 2,692 of 28,525 hip endoprotheses (9.44%) were implanted, whereas in 2015-2017 period 3,285 of 46,228 hips (7.11%) were operated on. This decline is statistically significant (p < 0.001, OR 1.34). DISCUSSION The efficiency and success rate of sonography resulted in Central Europe in such a rapid expansion of neonatal ultrasound hip screening that no comparative studies were carried out to confirm this concept (as is currently requested by evidencebased-medicine). This has later become the source of misunderstanding and subject to criticism primarily in the overseas literature. Those who focus on ultrasound screening feel that conducting prospective randomised studies on (non)treatment in ultrasound detected pathologies is ethically unacceptable today. When seeking another way of confirming the efficiency of universal screening, a detailed analysis of data from the hip joint replacement registry has proven successful. CONCLUSIONS A low number of arthroplasties implanted for hip dislocation in the Czech population is recorded in the National Register of Joint Replacement. This confirms the success of the existing system of neonatal hip screening; the results show that the treatment of hip dislocation in children is successful. The ongoing decline in the share of patients in the population treated by total hip replacement in postdysplastic degeneration has been confirmed. Data evolution will be subject to further research in the upcoming decades, with a positive effect of ultrasound monitoring of treatment to be foreseen.
