b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered heme protein in the vertebrate brain that can bind to oxygen molecules. Mammalian Ngb plays a crucial role in neuroprotection under conditions of oxidative stress. To investigate other potential functions of Ngb, we investigated the mouse retinal Ngb system following optic nerve injury. In the retina of control mice, Ngb immunoreactivity was limited to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer, and this immunoreactivity rapidly decreased to less than 50% of the control level 5 days after optic nerve injury. On the basis of this decrease, we designed in\xc2\xa0vivo experiments with enhanced expression of Ngb using adult mouse retina. The enhanced expression of Ngb was achieved by injecting chimeric human Ngb protein, which included the cell membrane-penetrating module of fish Ngb. One-day pretreatment with chimeric Ngb increased immunoreactivity levels of Ngb two-fold in mouse RGCs and increased the number of surviving RGCs three-fold by 14 days after optic nerve injury compared with vehicle controls. Furthermore, in the mouse retinas showing enhanced Ngb expression, several regenerating central optic axons exhibited outgrowth and were found to pass through the nerve crush site 14 days after nerve injury. No such regenerating optic axons were observed in the control mouse optic nerve during the same time frame. The data obtained from in\xc2\xa0vivo experiments strongly indicate that mammalian Ngb has neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties. labels: #Globins'
b'Low temperature frequently influences growth, development, and even survival of aquatic animals. In the present study, physiological and molecular responses to low temperature in Litopenaeus vannamei were investigated. The cDNA sequences of two oxygen-carrying proteins, cytoglobin (Cygb) and neuroglobin (Ngb), were isolated. Protein structure analysis revealed that both proteins share a globin superfamily domain. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that Cygb and Ngb mRNA levels gradually increased during decrease in temperatures from 25 to 15\xc2\xb0C and then decreased at 10\xc2\xb0C in muscle, brain, stomach, and heart, except for a continuing increase in gills, whereas they showed a different expression trend in the hepatopancreas. Hemocyanin concentration gradually reduced as the temperature decreased. Moreover, the activities of respiratory metabolic enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were measured, and it was found that LDH activity gradually increased while SDH activity decreased after low-temperature treatment. Finally, damage to gill structure at low temperature was also observed, and this intensified with further decrease in temperature. Taken together, these results show that low temperature has an adverse influence in L. vannamei, which contributes to systematic understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of shrimp at low temperature. labels: #Globins'
b"Dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP), a multifunctional globin protein, not only functions as an oxygen carrier as typical globins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin, but also as a peroxidase, a mono- and dioxygenase, peroxygenase, and an oxidase. Kinetics of DHP binding to NO, CO, and O2were characterized for wild-type DHP A and B and the H55D and H55V DHP A mutants using stopped-flow methods. All three gaseous ligands bind to DHP significantly more weakly than sperm whale myoglobin (SWMb). Both CO and NO bind to DHP in a one-step process to form a stable six-coordinate complex. Multiple-step NO binding is not observed in DHP, which is similar to observations in SWMb, but in contrast with many heme sensor proteins. The weak affinity of DHP for O2is mainly due to a fast O2dissociation rate, in accordance with a longer\xce\xb5N-Fe distance between the heme iron and distal histidine in DHP than that in Mb, and an open-distal pocket that permits ligand escape. Binding affinities in DHP show the same 3-4 orders separation between the pairs NO/CO and CO/O2, consistent with the 'sliding scale rule' hypothesis. Strong gaseous ligand discrimination by DHP is very different from that observed in typical peroxidases, which show poor gaseous ligand selectivity, correlating with a neutral proximal imidazole ligand rather than an imidazolate. The present study provides useful insights into the rationale for DHP to function both as mono-oxygenase and oxidase, and is the first example of a globin peroxidase shown to follow the 'sliding scale rule' hypothesis in gaseous ligand discrimination. labels: #Globins"
b'OBJECTIVE: The role of hemoglobin and myoglobin in the cardiovascular system is well established, yet other globins in this context are poorly characterized. Here, we examined the expression and function of cytoglobin (CYGB) during vascular injury.APPROACH AND RESULTS: We characterized CYGB content in intact vessels and primary vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and used 2 different vascular injury models to examine the functional significance of CYGB in vivo. We found that CYGB was strongly expressed in medial arterial VSM and human veins. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that CYGB was lost after VSM cell dedifferentiation. In the rat balloon angioplasty model, site-targeted delivery of adenovirus encoding shRNA specific for CYGB prevented its reexpression and decreased neointima formation. Similarly, 4 weeks after complete ligation of the left common carotid,Cygbknockout mice displayed little to no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia in contrast to their wild-type littermates. Mechanistic studies in the rat indicated that this was primarily associated with increased medial cell loss, terminal uridine nick-end labeling staining, and caspase-3 activation, all indicative of prolonged apoptosis. In vitro, CYGB could be reexpressed after VSM stimulation with cytokines and hypoxia and loss of CYGB sensitized human and rat aortic VSM cells to apoptosis. This was reversed after antioxidant treatment or NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2) inhibition.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CYGB is expressed in vessels primarily in differentiated medial VSM cells where it regulates neointima formation and inhibits apoptosis after injury. labels: #Globins'
b'Globin-coupled diguanylate cyclases contain globin, middle, and diguanylate cyclase domains that sense O2 to synthesize c-di-GMP and regulate bacterial motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. However, relatively few studies have extensively examined the roles of individual residues and domains of globin-coupled diguanylate cyclases, which can shed light on their signaling mechanisms and provide drug targets. Here, we report the critical residues of two globin-coupled diguanylate cyclases, EcGReg from Escherichia coli and BpeGReg from Bordetella pertussis, and show that their diguanylate cyclase activity requires an intact globin domain. In the distal heme pocket of the globin domain, residues Phe42, Tyr43, Ala68 (EcGReg)/Ser68 (BpeGReg), and Met69 are required to maintain full diguanylate cyclase activity. The highly conserved amino acids His223/His225 and Lys224/Lys226 in the middle domain of EcGReg/BpeGReg are essential to diguanylate cyclase activity. We also identified sixteen important residues (Leu300, Arg306, Asp333, Phe337, Lys338, Asn341, Asp342, Asp350, Leu353, Asp368, Arg372, Gly374, Gly375, Asp376, Glu377, and Phe378) in the active site and inhibitory site of the diguanylate cyclase domain of EcGReg. Moreover, BpeGReg266 (residues 1-266) and BpeGReg296 (residues 1-296), which only contain the globin and middle domains, can inhibit bacterial motility. Our findings suggest that the distal residues of the globin domain affect diguanylate cyclase activity and that BpeGReg may interact with other c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins to form mixed signaling teams. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin is a heme-containing protein ubiquitous in mammalian tissues. Unlike the evolutionarily related proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin, cytoglobin shows a six-coordinated heme binding, with the heme iron coordinated by two histidine side chains. Cytoglobin is involved in cytoprotection pathways through yet undefined mechanisms, and it has recently been demonstrated that cytoglobin has redox signaling properties via nitric oxide (NO) and nitrite metabolism. The reduced, ferrous cytoglobin can bind oxygen and will react with NO in a dioxygenation reaction to form nitrate, which dampens NO signaling. When deoxygenated, cytoglobin can bind nitrite and reduce it to NO. This oxidoreductase activity could be catalytic if an effective reduction system exists to regenerate the reduced heme species. The nature of the physiological cytoglobin reducing system is unknown, although it has been proposed that ascorbate and cytochrome b5could fulfill this role. Here we describe that physiological concentrations of cytochrome b5and cytochrome b5reductase can reduce human and fish cytoglobins at rates up to 250-fold higher than those reported for their known physiological substrates, hemoglobin and myoglobin, and up to 100-fold faster than 5 mM ascorbate. These data suggest that the cytochrome b5/cytochrome b5reductase system is a viable reductant for cytoglobin in vivo, allowing for catalytic oxidoreductase activity. labels: #Globins'
b'Liver fibrosis, a common pathological process of chronic liver diseases, is the final stage of liver dysfunction that has severely deleterious impact on human health. Cytoglobin was first discovered in 2001 by proteomic analysis in rat stellate cells and was reported to play an important role in controlling tissue fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which cytoglobin inhibits or reverses the progression of fibrosis remains unclear. The present study examines the effect of recombinant human cytoblobin (rhCygb) in a rat model of liver fibrosis. Proteomic approaches were employed to identify differentially expressed proteins in the fibrosis model. Optimized conditions for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were developed to provide improved protein detection and separation. A total of 43 spots were obtained and, through the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 30 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Gene ontology term annotation and KEGG pathway analysis allowed us to explore the function of the represented proteins. Based on these results, we provide a theory of the molecular mechanism related to rhCygb reversion of fibrosis and which will assist in the identification of biomarkers in patient serum to improve early diagnosis of liver fibrosis. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (CYGB), a member of the globin family, is thought to protect cells from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and deal with hypoxic conditions and oxidative stress. However, its molecular mechanisms of action are not clearly understood. Through immunoprecipitation combined with a two-dimensional electrophoresis-mass spectrometry assay, we identified a CYGB interactor: aldo-keto reductase family 7 member A2 (AKR7A2). The interaction was further confirmed using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our results show that AKR7A2 physically interacts with CYGB. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently identified hexa-coordinated globin, expressed in the nervous system of humans. Its physiological role is still debated: one hypothesis is that Ngb serves as an electron transfer (ET) species, possibly by reducing cytochrome c and preventing it to initiate the apoptotic cascade. Here, we use the perturbed matrix method (PMM), a mixed quantum mechanics/molecular dynamics approach, to investigate the redox thermodynamics of two neuroglobins, namely the human Ngb and GLB-6 from invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, we calculate the reduction potential of the two globins, resulting in an excellent agreement with the experimental values, and we predict the reorganization energies, \xce\xbb, which have not been determined experimentally yet. The calculated \xce\xbb values match well those reported for known ET proteins and thereby support a potential involvement in vivo of the two globins in ET processes. labels: #Globins'
b'The genomes are folded in a complex three-dimensional (3D) structure. Some features of this organization are common for all eukaryotes, but little is known about its evolution. Here, we have studied the 3D organization and regulation of zebrafish globin gene domain and compared its organization and regulation with those of other vertebrate species. In birds and mammals, the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes are segregated into separate clusters located on different chromosomes and organized into chromatin domains of different types, whereas in cold-blooded vertebrates, including Danio rerio, \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes are organized into common clusters. The major globin gene locus of Danio rerio is of particular interest as it is located in a genomic area that is syntenic in vertebrates and is controlled by a conserved enhancer. We have found that the major globin gene locus of Danio rerio is structurally and functionally segregated into two spatially distinct subloci harboring either adult or embryo-larval globin genes. These subloci demonstrate different organization at the level of chromatin domains and different modes of spatial organization, which appears to be due to selective interaction of the upstream enhancer with the sublocus harboring globin genes of the adult type. These data are discussed in terms of evolution of linear and 3D organization of gene clusters in vertebrates. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Neuroglobin (NGB) has been described as a neuroprotective agent in cerebral ischemia, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) has shown an important role in modulating hypoxic and ischemic injury, and therefore they have the potential to impact outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Thus, we investigated early changes in the concentrations of serum NGB and HIF-1\xce\xb1 after AIS and evaluated the relations of both NGB and HIF-1\xce\xb1 to stroke severity and prognosis.METHODS: We prospectively measured the serum concentrations of NGB and HIF-1\xce\xb1 in 40 patients with AIS at 24, 48, 72, and 96h after stroke. Correlation combined with infarct size and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of the patients was analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to appraise their value in predicting the 90-day outcome after AIS.RESULTS: Serum NGB concentrations increased and peaked at 72h after AIS, whereas serum concentrations of HIF-1\xce\xb1 increased for 48h. Peak serum NGB concentration correlated significantly with both infarct size (R2=0.484, p<0.001) and admission NIHSS score (R2=0.578, p<0.001), while serum HIF-1\xce\xb1 concentration was only correlated to a patient's infarct size (R2=0.394, p<0.001). ROC curve analysis suggested that the serum NGB concentration had a significantly better predictive power for poor outcome.CONCLUSIONS: NGB level increased in serum after AIS accompanied by increases in serum HIF-1\xce\xb1, and was suggested as a predictor of stroke severity and poor prognosis. labels: #Globins"
b'Hydrogen sulfide is a critical signaling molecule, but high concentrations cause cellular toxicity. A four-enzyme pathway in the mitochondrion detoxifies H2S by converting it to thiosulfate and sulfate. Recent studies have shown that globins like hemoglobin and myoglobin can also oxidize H2S to thiosulfate and hydropolysulfides. Neuroglobin, a globin enriched in the brain, was reported to bind H2S tightly and was postulated to play a role in modulating neuronal sensitivity to H2S in conditions such as stroke. However, the H2S reactivity of the coordinately saturated heme in neuroglobin is expecteda priorito be substantially lower than that of the 5-coordinate hemes present in myoglobin and hemoglobin. To resolve this discrepancy, we explored the role of the distal histidine residue in muting the reactivity of human neuroglobin toward H2S. Ferric neuroglobin is slowly reduced by H2S and catalyzes its inefficient oxidative conversion to thiosulfate. Mutation of the distal His64residue to alanine promotes rapid binding of H2S and its efficient conversion to oxidized products. X-ray absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy highlight the chemically different reaction options influenced by the distal histidine ligand. This study provides mechanistic insights into how the distal heme ligand in neuroglobin caps its reactivity toward H2S and identifies by cryo-mass spectrometry a range of sulfide oxidation products with 2-6 catenated sulfur atoms with or without oxygen insertion, which accumulate in the absence of the His64ligand. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Nocturnally active gymnotiform weakly electric fish generate electric signals for communication and navigation, which can be energetically taxing. These fish mainly inhabit the Amazon basin, where some species prefer well-oxygenated waters and others live in oxygen-poor, stagnant habitats. The latter species show morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations for hypoxia-tolerance. However, there have been no studies of hypoxia tolerance on the molecular level. Globins are classic respiratory proteins. They function principally in oxygen-binding and -delivery in various tissues and organs. Here, we investigate the molecular evolution of alpha and beta hemoglobins, myoglobin, and neuroglobin in 12 gymnotiforms compared with other teleost fish.RESULTS: The present study identified positively selected sites (PSS) on hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) genes using different maximum likelihood (ML) methods; some PSS fall in structurally important protein regions. This evidence for the positive selection of globin genes suggests that the adaptive evolution of these genes has helped to enhance the capacity for oxygen storage and transport. Interestingly, a substitution of a Cys at a key site in the obligate air-breathing electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) is predicted to enhance oxygen storage of Mb and contribute to NO delivery during hypoxia. A parallel Cys substitution was also noted in an air-breathing African electric fish (Gymnarchus niloticus). Moreover, the expected pattern under normoxic conditions of high expression of myoglobin in heart and neuroglobin in the brain in two hypoxia-tolerant species suggests that the main effect of selection on these globin genes is on their sequence rather than their basal expression patterns.CONCLUSION: Results indicate a clear signature of positive selection in the globin genes of most hypoxia-tolerant gymnotiform fishes, which are obligate or facultative air breathers. These findings highlight the critical role of globin genes in hypoxia tolerance evolution of Gymnotiform electric fishes. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) has been reported to be upregulated by hypoxia and plays an anti-apoptotic function. Previous studies have reported that Ngb is expressed in human glioblastoma cells and up-regulated in hypoxic microregions of glioblastoma tumor xenografts. While, the clinical significance of Ngb and its function in human glioma keep unknown. Ngb expression was analyzed in 86 glioma tissues and 20 normal brain tissues. Results showed that Ngb was significantly overexpressed in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues. In addition, increased levels of Ngb also observed in glioma cell lines. Clinicopathological analysis verified that the positive expression of Ngb was associated with histological type and world health organization (WHO) grade of glioma. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis found that Ngb overexpression led to a shorter survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that Ngb expression was an independent prognostic marker. Further experiments illustrated that Ngb knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation and facilitated apoptosis in U251 cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that Ngb silencing notably prohibited the tumor growth of glioma in nude mice. While, Ngb overexpression prominently promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in U87 cells. Taken together, this work support the first evidence that Ngb can be potentially used as a promising biomarker and target for novel treatment of human glioma. labels: #Globins'
b'Liuwei Dihuang pill (LDP) was assessed for its effects on renal deficiency.90 STZ induced DN rats were divided into groups (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a22) without treatment (STZ) and LDP treated (STZ-L) (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a23), Zhenwu decoction treated (STZ-Z) (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a22), and valsartan treated (STZ-V) (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a23) groups, with 16 normal control rats. Total urine protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Cr) were measured. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations as well as expression/phosphorylation of SMAD3, SMAD2, and \xce\xb1-SMA, TGF-\xce\xb2, RI /II, P38, ERK, and NF-kB in renal tissues were determined. In vitro experiments analyzed the effect of enhanced TGF-\xce\xb2 containing rat serums of the STZ groups on mesangial cells with and without transient transfection with a cytoglobin-containing plasmid.LDP treatment reduced the kidney coefficient, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine protein and prevented pathological changes. Expression of SOD and NOS in kidney tissue was increased but MDA expression reduced. LDP modulated multiple pathways, and its administration inhibited the phosphorylation of SMADS, ERK, p38, and the expression of NF-kB, \xce\xb1-SMA, and TGF-\xce\xb2 RI/II, and upregulated the expression of cytoglobin. In vitro studies revealed that overexpression of cytoglobin suppressed phosphorylation of Smad2, ERK, and p38 induced by TGF-\xce\xb2 and expression of NF-kB, \xce\xb1-SMA, and TGF-\xce\xb2 RI.LDP prevented renal fibrosis and protected glomerular mesangial cells by upregulation of cytoglobin and suppression of multiple pathways involving TGF-\xce\xb2/SMADS, MAPK, NF-kB signaling. labels: #Globins'
b'Objective:To investigate the role of neuroglobin (NGB) in oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced mitochondrial depolarization and reactive oxygen species (ROS)production in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y).Methods:SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with lentivirus to establish a stable cell line of NGB knockdown (KD). After treated with OGD/R, cells were collected at different time points to analyze NGB mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, cells were stained with JC-1 and DCFH-DA to evaluate mitochondrial depolarization and ROS production by inverted fluorescence microscope. Also, to determine the neurotoxicity, we measured the lactate dehydrogenase(LDH)level in the cell culture medium.Results:After the treatment of OGD/R, the NGB mRNA and protein started to elevate and peak at 4 h and 8 h (2.04\xc2\xb10.35 fold, 1.69\xc2\xb10.18 fold). Compared with the vector group, NGB KD group had much more mitochondrial depolarization [JC-1 red/green (1.10\xc2\xb10.10) vs (1.46\xc2\xb10.11),P<0.05] and ROS production [DCFH-DA fluorescence (36.30\xc2\xb15.32) vs (16.26\xc2\xb12.97),P<0.05]. Furthermore, NGB KD groups had a higher level of LDH release [(63.42\xc2\xb16.14)%vs (49.65\xc2\xb15.09)%,P<0.05].Conclusions:NGB plays an important role in the homeostasis of mitochondria. Knockdown of NGB results in increased mitochondrial depolarization, ROS production and neurotoxicity under hypoxia circumstances. labels: #Globins'
b'A kind of self-fluorescent, biocompatible, and low-toxic Genipin crosslinked Globin-PEI nanoparticle (Gb-G-PEI NP) with high enzymolysis-stability and photo-stability was synthesized successfully. The properties of the Gb-G-PEI NP were characterized, including its particle size, surface zeta potential, morphology, paclitaxel (PTX) loading capacity and release. The Gb-G-PEI NPs as imaging probe were investigated by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) in vitro and by fluorescence imaging system in vivo. Cell imaging results showed that the tumor cell line (HepG-2) had the faster cell uptake rate and metabolism rate than the normal cell line (L-O2), this difference showed its tumor selectivity. MTT assay revealed that the PTX-loaded Gb-G-PEI NPs showed almost the equal potence to tumor cell HepG-2 as the free PTX at the same PTX concentration, while a lower cytotoxicity to normal cell L-O2, suggesting its promising utilization as a drug delivery system. The imaging on mice demonstrated the possibility of the self-fluorescent Gb-G-PEI NPs as probe in vivo. So Gb-G-PEI NPs can be potentially utilized as both tracking marker and tumor cell selective drug delivery system in the biomaterial field. labels: #Globins'
b'Since its discovery, neuroglobin (Ngb), a neuron-specific oxygen binding hemoglobin, distinct from the classical myoglobin and blood hemoglobin, has attracted attention as an endogenous neuroprotectant. Recent reports suggest that Ngb protects neurons from brain stroke, ischemic stress-induced degeneration, and other brain disorders. Proteins with a specific role in neuroprotection are often associated with neurodegeneration, as well, depending on the cellular environment or specific cellular triggers that tilt the balance one way or the other. This investigation explored the potential role of Ngb in amyloid fibril-related neuronal disorder. Ngb was capable of amyloid formation in vitro at neutral pH and ambient temperature, in both apo and holo forms, albeit at a slower rate in the holo form, unlike other hemoglobins that exhibit such behavior exclusively in the apo states. Elevated temperature enhanced the rate of fibril formation significantly. The B-helix, which is known to play a major role in Ngb ligand binding kinetics, was found to be amyloidogenic with the Phe28B10amino acid side chain as the key inducer of fibrillation. The Ngb amyloid fibril was also significantly cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cell lines, compared to those obtained from reference hemoglobins. The Ngb fibril probably promoted toxicity by inducing channel formation in the cell membrane, as investigated here using synthetic lipid bilayer membranes and the propidium iodide uptake assay. These findings imply that Ngb plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders in vivo, for which there seems to be indirect evidence by association. Ngb thus presents a novel prospect for understanding amyloid-related brain disorders beyond the limited set of proteins currently investigated for such diseases. labels: #Globins'
b'Bacteria sense their environment to alter phenotypes, including biofilm formation, to survive changing conditions. Heme proteins play important roles in sensing the bacterial gaseous environment and controlling the switch between motile and sessile (biofilm) states. Globin coupled sensors (GCS), a family of heme proteins consisting of a globin domain linked by a central domain to an output domain, are often found with diguanylate cyclase output domains that synthesize c-di-GMP, a major regulator of biofilm formation. Characterization of diguanylate cyclase-containing GCS proteins from Bordetella pertussis and Pectobacterium carotovorum demonstrated that cyclase activity is controlled by ligand binding to the heme within the globin domain. Both O2binding to the heme within the globin domain and c-di-GMP binding to a product-binding inhibitory site (I-site) within the cyclase domain control oligomerization states of the enzymes. Changes in oligomerization state caused by c-di-GMP binding to the I-site also affect O2kinetics within the globin domain, suggesting that shifting the oligomer equilibrium leads to broad rearrangements throughout the protein. In addition, mutations within the I-site that eliminate product inhibition result in changes to the accessible oligomerization states and decreased catalytic activity. These studies provide insight into the mechanism by which ligand binding to the heme and I-site controls activity of GCS proteins and suggests a role for oligomerization-dependent activity in vivo. labels: #Globins'
b'Iron plays the central role in oxygen transport by erythrocytes as a constituent of heme and hemoglobin. The importance of iron and heme is also to be found in their regulatory roles during erythroblast maturation. The transcription factor Bach1 may be involved in their regulatory roles since it is deactivated by direct binding of heme. To address whether Bach1 is involved in the responses of erythroblasts to iron status, low iron conditions that induced severe iron deficiency in mice were established. Under iron deficiency, extensive gene expression changes and mitophagy disorder were induced during maturation of erythroblasts.Bach1-/-mice showed more severe iron deficiency anemia in the developmental phase of mice and a retarded recovery once iron was replenished when compared with wild-type mice. In the absence of Bach1, the expression of globin genes andHmox1(encoding heme oxygenase-1) was de-repressed in erythroblasts under iron deficiency, suggesting that Bach1 represses these genes in erythroblasts under iron deficiency to balance the levels of heme and globin. Moreover, an increase in genome-wide DNA methylation was observed in erythroblasts ofBach1-/-mice under iron deficiency. These findings reveal the principle role of iron as a regulator of gene expression in erythroblast maturation and suggest that the iron-heme-Bach1 axis is important for a proper adaptation of erythroblast to iron deficiency to avoid toxic aggregates of non-heme globin. labels: #Globins'
b'Oxidative stress, resulting from accumulation of reactive oxygen species, plays a critical role in astroglial cell death occurring in diverse neuropathological conditions. Numerous studies indicate that neuroglobin (Ngb) promotes neuron survival, but nothing is known regarding the action of Ngb in astroglial cell survival. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential glioprotective effect of Ngb on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured mouse astrocytes. Incubation of cells with subnanomolar concentrations of Ngb (10-14-10-10\xc2\xa0M) was found to prevent both H2O2-evoked reduction in surviving cells number and accumulation of reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ngb treatment abolishes H2O2-induced increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Concomitantly, Ngb treatment rescues H2O2-associated reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases and catalase) and prevents the stimulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin (IL) IL-6 and IL-33). Moreover, Ngb blocks the stimulation of Bax (pro-apoptotic) and the inhibition of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) gene expression induced by H2O2, which in turn abolishes caspase 3 activation. The protective effect of Ngb upon H2O2induced activation of caspase 3 activity and cell death can be accounted for by activation of protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase transduction cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that Ngb increases Akt phosphorylation and prevents H2O2-provoked inhibition of ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that Ngb is a glioprotective agent that prevents H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic astroglial cell death. Protection of astrocytes from oxidative insult may thus contribute to the neuroprotective effect of Ngb. labels: #Globins'
b"\xce\xb1-Thalassemia (\xce\xb1-thal) is among the world's most common single gene disorders, generally attributed to a selective advantage of heterozygotes against malaria mortality. A high frequency of -\xce\xb13.7deletion heterozygosity has been previously reported in Ashkenazi Jews despite lack of obvious malarial selection pressure in this population. Using haplotype and -\xce\xb13.7subtype analysis we analyzed a subset of -\xce\xb13.7homozygotes from various Israeli ethnic groups. We found a high frequency of the common Ia haplotype in Yemenite Jews and Arabs (54% and 13% respectively). Ashkenazi Jews exhibited a high frequency of IIIb alleles (67%) previously reported only in Aboriginal Australians and not found in other Israeli ethnicities. Both Yemenites and Ashkenazim carried the rare IIh alleles (18% and 15% respectively). These results may suggest multiple founder effects in Ashkenazi Jews as well a common founder for both Yemenite and Ashkenazi Jews. labels: #Globins"
b"Neuroglobin (NGB) is predominantly expressed in the brain and retina. Studies suggest that NGB exerts protective effects to neuronal cells and is implicated in reducing the severity of stroke and Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms which regulate the cell type-specific expression of the gene. In this study, we hypothesized that distal regulatory elements (DREs) are involved in optimal expression of the NGB gene. By chromosome conformation capture we identified two novel DREs located -70 kb upstream and +100 kb downstream from the NGB gene. ENCODE database showed the presence of DNaseI hypersensitive and transcription factors binding sites in these regions. Further analyses using luciferase reporters and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that the -70 kb region upstream of the NGB gene contained a neuronal-specific enhancer and GATA transcription factor binding sites. Knockdown of GATA-2 caused NGB expression to drop dramatically, indicating GATA-2 as an essential transcription factor for the activation of NGB expression. The crucial role of the DRE in NGB expression activation was further confirmed by the drop in NGB level after CRISPR-mediated deletion of the DRE. Taken together, we show that the NGB gene is regulated by a cell type-specific loop formed between its promoter and the novel DRE. labels: #Globins"
b'After red blood cells lysis, hemoglobin is released to blood circulation. Hemoglobin is carried in blood by binding to haptoglobin. In normal individuals, no free hemoglobin is observed in the blood, because most of the hemoglobin is in the form of haptoglobin complex. In some diseases that are accompanied by hemolysis, the amount of released hemoglobin is higher than its complementary haptoglobin. As a result, free hemoglobin appears in the blood, which is a toxic compound for these patients and may cause renal failure, hypertensive response and risk of atherogenesis. Free hemoglobin has been determined to have peroxidase activity and considered a pseudoenzyme. In this study, the effect of methocarbamol on the peroxidase activity of human hemoglobin was investigated. Our results showed that the drug inhibited the pseudoenzyme by un-competitive inhibition. Both Kmand Vmaxdecreased by increasing the drug concentration. Kiand IC50values were determined as 6 and 10mM, respectively. Docking results demonstrated that methocarbamol did not attach to heme group directly. A hydrogen bond linked NH2of carbamate group of methocarbamol to the carboxyl group of Asp126 side chain. Two other hydrogen bonds could be also observed between hydroxyl group of the drug and Ser102 and Ser133 residues of the pseudoenzyme. labels: #Globins'
b'Globin coupled sensors (GCS) are O2-sensing proteins used by bacteria to monitor the surrounding gaseous environment. To investigate the biphasic O2dissociation kinetics observed for full-length GCS proteins, isolated globin domains from Pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum (PccGlobin), and Bordetella pertussis (BpeGlobin), have been characterized. PccGlobin is found to be dimeric, while BpeGlobin is monomeric, indicating key differences in the globin domain dimer interface. Through characterization of wild type globin domains and globin variants with mutations at the dimer interface and within the distal pocket, dimerization of the globin domain is demonstrated to correlate with biphasic dissociation kinetics. Furthermore, a distal pocket tyrosine is identified as the primary hydrogen bond donor, while a secondary hydrogen bond donor within the distal heme pocket is involved in conformation(s) that lead to the second O2dissociation rate. These findings highlight the role of the globin dimer interface in controlling properties of both the heme pocket and full-length GCS proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'The in vivo fate of globin adducts with styrene 7,8-oxide (SO), an electrophilic metabolic intermediate of styrene, was studied in male Wistar rats dosed intraperitoneally with racemic SO, 100mg/kg b.w. Regioisomeric hydroxy(phenyl)ethyl (HPE) adducts at Cys, N-terminal Val, Lys and His in globin were determined and their elimination from blood was followed during 60days, corresponding to life span of rat erythrocytes. In the rat urine, N\xce\xb1-acetylated products of hydrolytic cleavage of the HPE adducts with Cys, Lys and His were determined. On the first day post-exposure, abundant N\xce\xb1-acetyl-HPE-Cys adducts (mercapturic acids) formed via direct conjugation of SO with hepatic glutathione were excreted rapidly, but then a much slower phase of elimination reflecting formation of N\xce\xb1-acetyl-HPE-Cys via cleavage of the adducted globin was observed. A two-phase elimination occurred also in urinary N\xce\xb1-acetyl-HPE adducts with His and Lys. While a decline by 75-85% during the first 7days post-exposure most likely reflected elimination of adducted albumin, the subsequent slow decline until day 60 corresponded to elimination kinetics of the adducted globin. Thus, the study not only provided original data on the fate of SO-globin adducts but also allowed to reveal general toxicokinetics properties of the urinary cleavage products as a novel type of chemical exposure biomarkers. labels: #Globins'
b'In this study, we investigated the effects of remote ischemic preconditioning on post resuscitation cerebral function in a rat model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The animals were randomized into six groups: 1) sham operation, 2) lateral ventricle injection and sham operation, 3) cardiac arrest induced by ventricular fibrillation, 4) lateral ventricle injection and cardiac arrest, 5) remote ischemic preconditioning initiated 90min before induction of ventricular fibrillation, and 6) lateral ventricle injection and remote ischemic preconditioning before cardiac arrest. Reagent of Lateral ventricle injection is neuroglobin antisense oligodeoxynucleotides which initiated 24h before sham operation, cardiac arrest or remote ischemic preconditioning. Remote ischemic preconditioning was induced by four cycles of 5min of limb ischemia, followed by 5min of reperfusion. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by current and lasted for 6min. Defibrillation was attempted after 6min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The animals were then monitored for 2h and observed for an additionally maximum 70h. Post resuscitation cerebral function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score at 72h after return of spontaneous circulation. Results showed that remote ischemic preconditioning increased neurologic deficit scores. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning, we observed neuronal injury at 48 and 72h after return of spontaneous circulation and found that remote ischemic preconditioning significantly decreased the occurrence of neuronal apoptosis and necrosis. To further comprehend mechanism of neuroprotection induced by remote ischemic preconditioning, we found expression of neuroglobin at 24h after return of spontaneous circulation was enhanced. Furthermore, administration of neuroglobin antisense oligodeoxynucleotides before induction of remote ischemic preconditioning showed that the level of neuroglobin was decreased then partly abrogated neuroprotection of remote ischemic preconditioning. These date suggested that neuroglobin involved in neuroprotective effect of remote ischemic preconditioning. In conclusion, remote ischemic preconditioning attenuated post resuscitation cerebral dysfunction and the neuroprotection was mediated partly by high level of neuroglobin in a rat model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. labels: #Globins'
b'The side stream cigarette smoke (SSCS) is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-induced toxicity. Hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin (Mb), neuroglobin (Ngb), and cytoglobin (Cygb) are globins with different distributions and functions in the tissues and have similar actions by providing O2(oxygen) for respiratory chain, detoxification of ROS and nitric oxide (NO), and protect tissues against irreversible lesions. We aimed to investigate the effects of SSCS exposure on gene and protein expression of Ngb, Cygb, and Mb in different tissue. The Ngb and Cygb gene and protein expression in the cerebral cortex increased after 1 week of rat exposure to SSCS. In hippocampus, the Ngb gene and protein expression increased after 1 week or more of exposure and no change was observed in Cygb gene and protein expression. In myocardium, Mb and Cygb gene expression increased at 1 and 4 weeks of exposure, while protein expression of both increased at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. In lung, observed an increase in Cygb gene and protein expression after 2, 3, and 4 weeks of exposure. The findings suggest that SSCS modulates Ngb, Cygb, and Mb in central and peripheral tissue \xc2\xa9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 32: 1252-1261, 2017. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus follows the classic step-wise progression of metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma. While Barrett's esophagus is a leading known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, the pathogenesis of this disease sequence is poorly understood. Mitochondria are highly susceptible to mutations due to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled with low levels of DNA repair. The timing and levels of mitochondria instability and dysfunction across the Barrett's disease progression is under studied.METHODS: Using an in-vitro model representing the Barrett's esophagus disease sequence of normal squamous epithelium (HET1A), metaplasia (QH), dysplasia (Go), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (OE33), random mitochondrial mutations, deletions and surrogate markers of mitochondrial function were assessed. In-vivo and ex-vivo tissues were also assessed for instability profiles.RESULTS: Barrett's metaplastic cells demonstrated increased levels of ROS (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.005) and increased levels of random mitochondrial mutations (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) compared with all other stages of the Barrett's disease sequence in-vitro. Using patient in-vivo samples, Barrett's metaplasia tissue demonstrated significantly increased levels of random mitochondrial deletions (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.043) compared with esophageal adenocarcinoma tissue, along with increased expression of cytoglobin (CYGB) (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05), a gene linked to oxidative stress, compared with all other points across the disease sequence. Using ex-vivo Barrett's metaplastic and matched normal patient tissue explants, higher levels of cytochrome c (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.003), SMAC/Diablo (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.008) and four inflammatory cytokines (all p values<0.05) were secreted from Barrett's metaplastic tissue compared with matched normal squamous epithelium.CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that increased mitochondrial instability and markers of cellular and mitochondrial stress are early events in the Barrett's disease sequence. labels: #Globins"
b'The true function of neuroglobin (Ngb) and, particularly, human Ngb (NGB) has been under debate since its discovery 15 years ago. It has been expected to play a role in oxygen binding/supply, but a variety of other functions have been put forward, including NO dioxygenase activity. However, in vitro studies that could unravel these potential roles have been hampered by the lack of an Ngb-specific reductase. In this work, we used electrochemical measurements to investigate the role of an intermittent internal disulfide bridge in determining NO oxidation kinetics at physiological NO concentrations. The use of a polarized electrode to efficiently interconvert the ferric (Fe(3+)) and ferrous (Fe(2+)) forms of an immobilized NGB showed that the disulfide bridge both defines the kinetics of NO dioxygenase activity and regulates appearance of the free ferrous deoxy-NGB, which is the redox active form of the protein in contrast to oxy-NGB. Our studies further identified a role for the distal histidine, interacting with the hexacoordinated iron atom of the heme, in oxidation kinetics. These findings may be relevant in vivo, for example, in blocking apoptosis by reduction of ferric cytochrome c, and gentle tuning of NO concentration in the tissues. labels: #Globins'
b'Parkinson\xc2\xb4s disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy bodies that are mainly composed of \xce\xb1-synuclein (\xce\xb1Syn). Elevated levels of oxidative or nitrative stresses have been implicated in \xce\xb1Syn related toxicity. Phosphorylation of \xce\xb1Syn on serine 129 (S129) modulates autophagic clearance of inclusions and is prominently found in Lewy bodies. The neighboring tyrosine residues Y125, Y133 and Y136 are phosphorylation and nitration sites. Using a yeast model of PD, we found that Y133 is required for protective S129 phosphorylation and for S129-independent proteasome clearance. \xce\xb1Syn can be nitrated and form stable covalent dimers originating from covalent crosslinking of two tyrosine residues. Nitrated tyrosine residues, but not di-tyrosine-crosslinked dimers, contributed to \xce\xb1Syn cytotoxicity and aggregation. Analysis of tyrosine residues involved in nitration and crosslinking revealed that the C-terminus, rather than the N-terminus of \xce\xb1Syn, is modified by nitration and di-tyrosine formation. The nitration level of wild-type \xce\xb1Syn was higher compared to that of A30P mutant that is non-toxic in yeast. A30P formed more dimers than wild-type \xce\xb1Syn, suggesting that dimer formation represents a cellular detoxification pathway in yeast. Deletion of the yeast flavohemoglobin gene YHB1 resulted in an increase of cellular nitrative stress and cytotoxicity leading to enhanced aggregation of A30P \xce\xb1Syn. Yhb1 protected yeast from A30P-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and peroxynitrite-induced nitrative stress. Strikingly, overexpression of neuroglobin, the human homolog of YHB1, protected against \xce\xb1Syn inclusion formation in mammalian cells. In total, our data suggest that C-terminal Y133 plays a major role in \xce\xb1Syn aggregate clearance by supporting the protective S129 phosphorylation for autophagy and by promoting proteasome clearance. C-terminal tyrosine nitration increases pathogenicity and can only be partially detoxified by \xce\xb1Syn di-tyrosine dimers. Our findings uncover a complex interplay between S129 phosphorylation and C-terminal tyrosine modifications of \xce\xb1Syn that likely participates in PD pathology. labels: #Globins'
b'Although paclitaxel (Taxol) is an active chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer, not all breast tumors are sensitive to this drug. In particular, there is a wide agreement on the low sensitivity of estrogen receptor (ER) \xce\xb1-positive breast cancer to paclitaxel treatment. However, the ER\xce\xb1-based insensitivity to paclitaxel is still elusive. Here, the effect of the E2/ER\xce\xb1-dependent upregulation of neuroglobin (NGB), an antiapoptotic globin, on the reduced sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis has been evaluated in ER\xce\xb1-containing MCF-7 cells. The E2 pretreatment enhances the ER\xce\xb1 activity and significantly impairs paclitaxel-induced apoptosis as evaluated by Annexin V assay and PARP-1 cleavage. NGB displays a pivotal role in the E2/ER\xce\xb1-induced antiapoptotic pathway to abrogate paclitaxel-induced cell death in stable NGB-silenced MCF-7 cell clones. Moreover, in the absence of the active ER\xce\xb1, paclitaxel significantly reduces the NGB cell content. In conclusion, these results highlight the involvement of ER\xce\xb1 activation and of E2/ER\xce\xb1-dependent NGB upregulation in the insensitivity of MCF-7 to paclitaxel. These novel findings could have important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming paclitaxel insensitivity in ER\xce\xb1-positive human breast cancer. \xc2\xa9 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(8):645-651, 2016. labels: #Globins'
b'Erythroid cell commitment and differentiation proceed through activation of a lineage-restricted transcriptional network orchestrated by a group of well characterized genes. However, the minimal set of factors necessary for instructing red blood cell (RBC) development remains undefined. We employed a screen for transcription factors allowing direct lineage reprograming from fibroblasts to induced erythroid progenitors/precursors (iEPs). We show that Gata1, Tal1, Lmo2, and c-Myc (GTLM) can rapidly convert murine and human fibroblasts directly to iEPs. The transcriptional signature of murine iEPs resembled mainly that of primitive erythroid progenitors in the yolk sac, whereas addition of Klf1 or Myb to the GTLM cocktail resulted in iEPs with a more adult-type globin expression pattern. Our results demonstrate that direct lineage conversion is a suitable platform for defining and studying the core factors inducing the different waves of erythroid development. labels: #Globins'
b'Tibolone, a synthetic steroid used for the prevention of osteoporosis and the treatment of climacteric symptoms in post-menopausal women, may exert tissue selective estrogenic actions acting on estrogen receptors (ERs). We previously showed that tibolone protects human T98G astroglial cells against glucose deprivation (GD). In this study we have explored whether the protective effect of tibolone on these cells is mediated by ERs. Experimental studies showed that both ER\xce\xb1 and ER\xce\xb2 were involved in the protection by tibolone on GD cells, being ER\xce\xb2 preferentially involved on these actions over ER\xce\xb1. Tibolone increased viability of GD cells by a mechanism fully blocked by an ER\xce\xb2 antagonist and partially blocked by an ER\xce\xb1 antagonist. Furthermore, ER\xce\xb2 inhibition prevented the effect of tibolone on nuclear fragmentation, ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential in GD cells. The protective effect of tibolone was mediated by neuroglobin. Tibolone upregulated neuroglobin in T98G cells and primary mouse astrocytes by a mechanism involving ER\xce\xb2 and neuroglobin silencing prevented the protective action of tibolone on GD cells. In summary, tibolone protects T98G cells by a mechanism involving ER\xce\xb2 and the upregulation of neuroglobin. labels: #Globins'
b'Recombinant ferrochelatase (BsFECH) from Bacillus subtilis expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was found by UV-visible spectroscopy to bind the model substrate tetraphenylporphyrin-sulfonate, TPPS, with Ka=3.8 10(5)mol/L in aqueous phosphate buffer pH 5.7 at 30\xc2\xb0C, and to interact with metmyoglobin with Ka=1.07\xc2\xb10.13 10(5)mol/L at 30\xc2\xb0C. The iron/zinc exchange in myoglobin occurring during maturation of Parma hams seems to depend on such substrate binding to BsFECH and was facilitated by limited pepsin proteolysis of myoglobin to open a reaction channel for metal exchange still with BsFECH associated to globin. BsFECH increased rate of zinc insertion in TPPS significantly and showed saturation kinetics with an apparent binding constant of Zn(II) to the [enzyme-TPPS] complex of 1.3 10(4)mol/L and a first-order rate constant of 6.6 10(-1)s(-1) for dissociation of the tertiary complex, a similar pattern was found for zinc/iron transmetallation in myoglobin. labels: #Globins'
b'The over-expression of human neuroglobin (NGB), a heme-protein preferentially expressed in the brain, displays anti-apoptotic effects against hypoxic/ischemic and oxidative stresses enhancing neuron survival. As hypoxic and oxidative stress injury frequently occurs in fast proliferating neoplastic tissues, here, the effect of these stressors on the level, localization, and anti-apoptotic function of NGB in wild type and NGB-stable-silenced MCF-7 breast cancer cells has been assessed. The well-known endogenous NGB inducer 17\xce\xb2-estradiol (E2) has been used as positive control. The median pO2 present in tumor microenvironment of breast cancer patients (i.e., 2% O2) does not affect the NGB level in breast cancer cells, whereas hydrogen peroxide and lead(IV) acetate, which increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, enhance the NGB levels outside the mitochondria and still activate apoptosis. However, E2-induced NGB up-regulation in mitochondria completely reverse lead(IV) acetate-induced PARP cleavage. These results indicate that the NGB level could represent a marker of oxidative-stress in MCF-7 breast cancer cells; however, the NGB ability to respond to injuring stimuli by preventing apoptosis requires its re-allocation into the mitochondria. As a whole, present data might lead to a new direction in understanding NGB function in cancer opening new avenues for the therapeutic intervention. labels: #Globins'
b'The compound \xce\xb2\xc2\xb0-thalassemia/Hb E hemoglobinopathy is characterized by an unusually large range of presentation from essentially asymptomatic to a severe transfusion dependent state. While a number of factors are known that moderate presentation, these factors do not account for the full spectrum of presentation. Mitochondria are subcellular organelles that are pivotal in a number of cellular processes including oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis. A mitochondrial protein enriched proteome was determined and validated from erythroblasts from normal controls and \xce\xb2\xc2\xb0-thalassemia/Hb E patients of different severities. Mitochondria were evaluated through the use of mitotracker staining, analysis of relative mitochondrial genome number and evaluation of mitochondrial gene expression in addition to assay of overall cellular redox status through the use of alamarBlue assays. Fifty differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins were identified. Mitotracker staining revealed significant differences in staining between normal control erythroblasts and those from \xce\xb2\xc2\xb0-thalassemia/Hb E patients. Differences in relative mitochondria number and gene expression were seen primarily in day 10 cells. Significant differences were seen in redox status as evaluated by alamarBlue staining in newly isolated CD34+ cells. Mitochondria mediate oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis, both of which are known to be dysregulated in differentiating erythrocytes from \xce\xb2\xc2\xb0-thalassemia/Hb E patients. The evidence presented here suggest that there are inherent differences in these cells as early as the erythroid progenitor cell stage, and that maximum deficit is seen coincident with high levels of globin gene expression. labels: #Globins'
b'This work demonstrates the feasibility of making sensitive nanometer distance measurements between Fe(III) heme centers and nitroxide spin labels in proteins using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) pulsed EPR technique at 94 GHz. Techniques to measure accurately long distances in many classes of heme proteins using DEER are currently strongly limited by sensitivity. In this paper we demonstrate sensitivity gains of more than 30 times compared with previous lower frequency (X-band) DEER measurements on both human neuroglobin and sperm whale myoglobin. This is achieved by taking advantage of recent instrumental advances, employing wideband excitation techniques based on composite pulses and exploiting more favorable relaxation properties of low-spin Fe(III) in high magnetic fields. This gain in sensitivity potentially allows the DEER technique to be routinely used as a sensitive probe of structure and conformation in the large number of heme and many other metalloproteins. labels: #Globins'
b'This study aims to investigate whether the use of recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCygb) impact on hepatic fibrogenesis caused by CCl4. SD (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89150) rats were randomly divided into three groups of normal, CCl4 model and rhCygb groups. After model establishment, rats in rhCygb groups were administered daily with rhCygb (2\xe2\x80\x89mg/kg, s.c.). Histological lesions were staged according to metavir. Serum parameters including ALT, AST, HA, LN, Col III and Col IV were determined. The liver proteins were separated by 2-DE and identified. As a result, the stage of hepatic damage and liver fibrosis in rhCygb groups were significantly milder than that in CCl4 model groups. Meanwhile, rhCygb dramatically reversed serum levels of ALT and AST, and also markedly decreased the liver fibrosis markers levels of LN, HA, Col III and Col IV. In 2-DE, 33 proteins among three groups with the same changing tendency in normal and rhCygb treated groups compared with CCl4 model group were identified. GO analysis showed that several identified proteins involved in oxidative stress pathway. The study provides new insights and data for administration of rhCygb reversing CCl4-induced liver fibrosis suggesting that rhCygb might be used in the treatment of liver fibrosis. labels: #Globins'
b'Almost all insects are equipped with a tracheal system, which appears to be sufficient for O2 supply even in phases of high metabolic activity. Therefore, with the exception of a few species dwelling in hypoxic habitats, specialized respiratory proteins had been considered unnecessary in insects. The recent discovery and apparently universal presence of intracellular hemoglobins in insects has remained functionally unexplained. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster harbors three different globin genes (referred to as glob1-3). Glob1 is the most highly expressed globin and essentially occurs in the tracheal system and the fat body. To better understand the functions of insect globins, the levels of glob1 were modulated in Drosophila larvae and adults by RNAi-mediated knockdown and transgenic over-expression. No effects on the development were observed in flies with manipulated glob1 levels. However, the knockdown of glob1 led to a significantly reduced survival rate of adult flies under hypoxia (5% and 1.5% O2). Surprisingly, the glob1 knockdown flies also displayed increased resistance towards the reactive oxygen species-forming agent paraquat, which may be explained by a restricted availability of O2 resulting in decreased formation of harmful O2(-). In summary, our results suggest an important functional role of glob1 in O2 homeostasis, possibly by enhancing O2 supply. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective against stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, thus upregulating Ngb might be a novel approach for neuroprotection. In this study we aimed to establish cell-based Ngb reporter systems for screening neuroprotective compounds targeting Ngb upregulation. We developed both mouse and human stable Ngb reporter systems containing a luciferase reporter gene directed by mouse and human Ngb promoter, respectively. To validate these reporter systems, we used them to screen a pool of natural plant compounds. RT-PCR was used to verify the Ngb-upregulating effects of selected compounds, and neurotoxicity assay was used to test their neuroprotection effects in primary cultured neurons. We identified polydatin, genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin that can upregulate both mouse and human Ngb promoter activity. RT-PCR confirmed that polydatin, genistein and formononetin significantly increased Ngb mRNA expression in primary neurons. Furthermore, formononetin significantly decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, inhibition of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) showed that CREB is required for formononetin-induced Ngb upregulation. These results suggest that these Ngb reporter systems are suitable for neuroprotective compound screening, which will be used to screen larger compound libraries for more potent neuroprotectants. This preliminary study will facilitate the development of Ngb-targeted therapeutics for stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. labels: #Globins'
b'A new experimental model was designed to study the fate of globin adducts with styrene 7,8-oxide (SO), a metabolic intermediate of styrene and a model electrophilic compound. Rat erythrocytes were incubated with SO at 7 or 22 \xc2\xb0C. Levels of specific amino acid adducts in globin were determined by LC/MS analysis of the globin hydrolysate, and erythrocytes with known adduct content were administered intravenously to recipient rats. The course of adduct elimination from the rat blood was measured over the following 50 days. In the erythrocytes incubated at 22 \xc2\xb0C, a rapid decline in the adduct levels on the first day post-transfusion followed by a slow phase of elimination was observed. In contrast, the adduct elimination in erythrocytes incubated at 7 \xc2\xb0C was nearly linear, copying elimination of intact erythrocytes. In the urine of recipient rats, regioisomeric SO adducts at cysteine, valine, lysine, and histidine in the form of amino acid adducts and/or their acetylated metabolites as well as SO-dipeptide adducts were identified by LC/MS supported by synthesized reference standards. S-(2-Hydroxy-1-phenylethyl)cysteine and S-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)cysteine, the most abundant globin adducts, were excreted predominantly in the form of the corresponding urinary mercapturic acids (HPEMAs). Massive elimination of HPEMAs via urine occurred within the first day from the erythrocytes incubated at both 7 and 22 \xc2\xb0C. However, erythrocytes incubated at 7 \xc2\xb0C also showed a slow second phase of elimination such that HPEMAs were detected in urine up to 50 days post-transfusion. These results indicate for the first time that globin adducts can be cleaved in vivo to modified amino acids and dipeptides. The cleavage products and/or their predictable metabolites are excreted in urine over the whole life span of erythrocytes. Some of the urinary adducts may represent a new type of noninvasive biomarker for exposure to adduct-forming chemicals. labels: #Globins'
b"Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexa-coordinated hemoprotein with yet to be defined physiological functions. The iron coordination and spin state of the Cygb heme group are sensitive to oxidation of two cysteine residues (Cys38/Cys83) and/or the binding of free fatty acids. However, the roles of redox vs lipid regulators of Cygb's structural rearrangements in the context of the protein peroxidase competence are not known. Searching for physiologically relevant lipid regulators of Cygb, here we report that anionic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositolphosphates, affect structural organization of the protein and modulate its iron state and peroxidase activity both conjointly and/or independently of cysteine oxidation. Thus, different anionic lipids can operate in cysteine-dependent and cysteine-independent ways as inducers of the peroxidase activity. We establish that Cygb's peroxidase activity can be utilized for the catalysis of peroxidation of anionic phospholipids (including phosphatidylinositolphosphates) yielding mono-oxygenated molecular species. Combined with the computational simulations we propose a bipartite lipid binding model that rationalizes the modes of interactions with phospholipids, the effects on structural re-arrangements and the peroxidase activity of the hemoprotein. labels: #Globins"
b'Cytoglobin (Cgb) is a member of hemoprotein family with roles in NO metabolism, fibrosis, and tumourigenesis. Similar to other hemoproteins, Cgb structure and functions are markedly influenced by distal key residues. The sixth ligand His(81) (E7) is crucial to exogenous ligand binding, heme pocket conformation, and physiological roles of this protein. However, the effects of other key residues on heme pocket and protein biological functions are not well known. In this work, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of two single mutants in CO-ligated Cgb (L46FCgbCO and L46VCgbCO) and two double mutants (L46FH81QCgbCO and L46VH81QCgbCO) was conducted to explore the effects of the key distal residues Leu(46)(B10) and His(81)(E7) on Cgb structure and functions. Results indicated that the distal mutation of B10 and E7 affected CgbCO dynamic properties on loop region fluctuation, internal cavity rearrangement, and heme motion. The distal conformation change was reflected by the distal key residues Gln(62) (CD3) and Arg(84)(E10). The hydrogen bond between heme propionates with CD3 or E10 residues were evidently influenced by B10/E7 mutation. Furthermore, heme pocket rearrangement was also observed based on the distal pocket volume and occurrence rate of inner cavities. The mutual effects of B10 and E7 residues on protein conformational rearrangement and other dynamic features were expressed in current MD studies of CgbCO and its distal mutants, suggesting their crucial role in heme pocket stabilization, ligand binding, and Cgb biological functions. The mutation of distal B10 and E7 residues affects the dynamic features of carboxy cytoglobin. labels: #Globins'
b'Scavenging of nitric oxide (NO) often interferes with studies on NO signaling in cell-free preparations. We observed that formation of cGMP by NO-stimulated purified soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) was virtually abolished in the presence of cytosolic preparations of porcine coronary arteries, with the scavenging activity localized in the tunica media (smooth muscle layer). Electrochemical measurement of NO release from a donor compound and light absorbance spectroscopy showed that cytosolic preparations contained a reduced heme protein that scavenged NO. This protein, which reacted with anti-human hemoglobin antibodies, was efficiently removed from the preparations by haptoglobin affinity chromatography. The cleared cytosols showed only minor scavenging of NO according to electrochemical measurements and did not decrease cGMP formation by NO-stimulated sGC. In contrast, the column flow-through caused a nearly 2-fold increase of maximal sGC activity (from 33.1 \xc2\xb1 1.6 to 54.9 \xc2\xb1 2.2 \xce\xbcmol \xc3\x97 min(-1) \xc3\x97 mg(-1)). The proteins retained on the affinity column were identified as hemoglobin \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 subunits. The results indicate that hemoglobin, presumably derived from vasa vasorum erythrocytes, is present and scavenges NO in preparations of porcine coronary artery smooth muscle. Selective removal of hemoglobin-mediated scavenging unmasked stimulation of maximal NO-stimulated sGC activity by a soluble factor expressed in vascular tissue. labels: #Globins'
b'Soluble guanylate cyclases (sGCs) are gas-binding proteins that control diverse physiological processes such as vasodilation, platelet aggregation, and synaptic plasticity. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a complex of sGCs, GCY-35 and GCY-36, functions in oxygen (O2) sensing. Previous studies suggested that the neuroglobin GLB-5 genetically interacts with GCY-35, and that the inhibitory effect of GLB-5 on GCY-35 function is necessary for fast recovery from prolonged hypoxia. In this study, we identified mutations in gcy-35 and gcy-36 that impact fast recovery and other phenotypes associated with GLB-5, without undermining sGC activity. These mutations, heb1 and heb3, change conserved amino acid residues in the regulatory H-NOX domains of GCY-35 and GCY-36, respectively, and appear to suppress GLB-5 activity by different mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that short exposure to 35% O2 desensitized the neurons responsible for ambient O2 sensing and that this phenomenon does not occur in heb1 animals. These observations may implicate sGCs in neuronal desensitization mechanisms far beyond the specific case of O2 sensing in nematodes. The conservation of functionally important regions of sGCs is supported by examining site-directed mutants of GCY-35, which suggested that similar regions in the H-NOX domains of O2 and NO-sensing sGCs are important for heme/gas interactions. Overall, our studies provide novel insights into sGC activity and regulation, and implicate similar structural determinants in the control of both O2 and NO sensors. Significance statement: Soluble guanylate cyclases (sGCs) control essential and diverse physiological processes, including memory processing. We used Caenorhabditis elegans to explore how a neuroglobin inhibits a complex of oxygen-sensing sGCs, identifying sGC mutants that resist inhibition. Resistance appears to arise by two different mechanisms: increased basal sGC activity or disruption of an interaction with neuroglobin. Our findings demonstrate that the inhibition of sGCs by neuroglobin is essential for rapid adaptation to either low or high oxygen levels, and that similar structural regions are key for regulating both oxygen and nitric oxide sensors. Based on our structural and functional analyses, we present the hypothesis that neuroglobin-sGC interactions may be generally important for adaptation processes, including those in organisms with more complex neurological functions. labels: #Globins'
b'This investigation examines oxidation conditions under which hemoglobin extracts membrane phospholipid from erythrocytes and model membranes. In erythrocytes made echinocytic with exogenous phospholipid, addition of hemoglobin oxidized with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or Vitamin C (conditions that result in the formation of significant quantities of choleglobin), but not ferricyanide (which produces predominantly methemoglobin), induced dose-dependent shape reversion to less echinocytic forms, consistent with extraction of phospholipids from the exofacial side of the membrane. Erythrocytes preloaded with radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine or NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidic acid, exhibited greatest extraction of radiolabel or fluorescence signal with exogenous hemoglobin oxidized via H2O2 or Vitamin C, but not ferricyanide. However, with NBD-phosphatidylserine (a preferential inner monolayer intercalator), significantly less extraction of labeled lipid occurred with oxidized hemoglobin prepared under all three oxidizing conditions. In dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes containing radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine, subsequent addition of hemoglobin oxidized with H2O2 or Vitamin C extracted radiolabeled lipid with significantly greater efficiency than ferricyanide-treated hemoglobin, with enhanced extraction detectable at levels approaching physiological plasma oxidant concentrations. Radiolabeled lipid extraction was comparable for phospholipids containing saturated acyl chains between 12 and 18 carbons but diminished significantly for oleoyl-containing phospholipids. Hemoglobin dimerization occurred at very low levels with H2O2 treatment, and even lower levels with Vitamin C treatment, and thus did not correlate to the high efficiency and consistent levels of lipid extraction observed with these treatments. These findings indicate that choleglobin extracts lipids from cell membranes regardless of headgroup or acyl chain length, through a process of direct hydrophobic interaction with the membrane surface. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb) are two six-coordinate heme proteins of unknown physiological function. Although studies on the mammalian proteins have elucidated aspects of Ngb and Cygb biophysics and indicated potential functions, the properties of non-mammalian Ngbs and Cygbs are largely uncharacterized. We have expressed the recombinant zebrafish proteins Ngb, Cygb1, and Cygb2 in Escherichia coli and characterized their nitrite reduction rates, spectral properties, autoxidation rate constants, redox potentials and lipid binding properties. The three zebrafish proteins can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide with a broad range of reaction rate constants. (Ngb, 0.68\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.04\xc2\xa0M(-1)\xc2\xa0s(-1); Cygb1, 28.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa03.1\xc2\xa0M(-1)\xc2\xa0s(-1); Cygb2, 0.94\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.18\xc2\xa0M(-1)\xc2\xa0s(-1)). We observe that zebrafish Ngb and Cygb2 have comparable spectral features to those of human Ngb and Cygb, consistent with a six-coordinate heme, whereas unexpectedly Cygb1 has a five-coordinate heme, a slower autoxidation and in general has properties more akin to oxygen transport proteins. In agreement with a possible oxygen carrier and nitrite reductase role, we detect mRNA transcript for Cygb1 but not Cygb2 or Ngb in zebrafish blood. Unlike human Cygb, neither of the zebrafish globins binds oleic acid with high affinity. This finding suggests that lipid binding may be a trait acquired later during evolution and not an ancestral property of cytoglobins. Altogether, our results uncover unexpected properties of zebrafish globins and reveal the pivotal role of cytoglobins in the transition of heme globins from six-coordinate to five-coordinate oxygen carriers and nitrite reductases. labels: #Globins'
b'One of the most common silent \xce\xb2-thalassemia mutations is the C>T substitution at position -101 within the distal CACCC box, which leads to a mild reduction in the expression level of the \xce\xb2-globin gene. Carriers of this mutation have a normal hematologic picture without microcytosis and borderline hemoglobin A2 values, and may be missed during screening. Co-occurrence of this mutation with one of the classical \xce\xb2-thalassemia mutations leads to \xce\xb2-thalassemia intermedia, and this is important for Mediterranean populations where \xce\xb2-thalassemia is frequent. Awareness of this mutation, which may have a heterogeneous clinical presentation, is required. We herein present the unusual hematologic findings of a Turkish family carrying this mutation. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (NGB) is a newly discovered neuroprotector and mainly localized in the neurons and retinal cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrates, and its prokaryotic expression protein of which fused with HIV-1 virus-encoded Tat peptide exhibited significant antioxidant and anti-hypoxia. However, no study has documented on the anti-hypoxia of yeast expressed Tat-NGB. To address it, the NGB cDNA fragment with and without Tat tag was designed and conjugated to pPIC9K followed by electroporation, and positive colonies were screened. Subsequently, Tat-NGB-His and His-NGB-His proteins were expressed by inducer methanol and identified by SDS-PAGE, and purified with HisTrap\xe2\x84\xa2 FF crude column. After desalting, the transmembrane transduction of Tat-NGB was examined and identified by Western blot, and the anti-hypoxia activity was also examined by CCK-8 kit. Unexpectedly, Tat-NGB-His and His-NGB-His proteins were high yield and secretory expressed in GS115 Pichia\xc2\xa0pastoris. After purification, the high purified protein was prepared and exhibited a significant transmembrane transduction of Tat-NGB-His (**p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01, compare to control and His-NGB-His). Significantly, Tat-NGB-His could protect hypoxia induced injury of PC12 cells and had an obviously difference when comparing to control and His-NGB-His groups (*p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05, **p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01). The present study first reported the yeast expressed production of Tat-NGB-His and His-NGB-His, and then elucidated the transduction and neuroprotection of Tat-NGB-His on PC12 cell. It not only provided a significant reference for high-yield expression of NGB in yeast expression system, but also provided a significant prevention and treatment of hypoxic and ischemic brain injury. labels: #Globins'
b'Globin X (GbX) is a member of the globin family that emerged early in the evolution of Metazoa. In vertebrates, GbX is restricted to lampreys, fish, amphibians and some reptiles, and is expressed in neurons. Unlike any other metazoan globin, GbX is N-terminally acylated and anchored in the cell membrane via myristoyl and palmitoyl groups, suggesting a unique function. Here, we compared the capacity of GbX to protect a mouse neuronal cell line from hypoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with that of myoglobin. To evaluate the contribution of membrane-binding, we generated a mutated version of GbX without acyl groups. All three globins enhanced cell viability under hypoxia, with myoglobin having the most pronounced effect. GbX but not myoglobin protected the cells from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced stress. Membrane-bound GbX was significantly more efficient than its mutated, soluble form. Furthermore, myoglobin and mutated GbX increased production of ROS upon H2O2-treatment, while membrane-bound GbX did not. The results indicate that myoglobin enhances O2 supply while GbX protects the cell membrane from ROS-stress. The ancient origin of GbX suggests that ROS-protection reflects the function of the early globins before they acquired a respiratory role. labels: #Globins'
b'Moderate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are now recognized as redox signalling molecules. However, thus far, only mitochondria and NADPH oxidases have been identified as cellular sources of ROS in signalling. Here we identify a globin (GLB-12) that produces superoxide, a type of ROS, which serves as an essential signal for reproduction in C. elegans. We find that GLB-12 has an important role in the regulation of multiple aspects in germline development, including germ cell apoptosis. We further describe how GLB-12 displays specific molecular, biochemical and structural properties that allow this globin to act as a superoxide generator. In addition, both an intra- and extracellular superoxide dismutase act as key partners of GLB-12 to create a transmembrane redox signal. Our results show that a globin can function as a driving factor in redox signalling, and how this signal is regulated at the subcellular level by multiple control layers. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is an oxygen-binding protein with a demonstrated role in endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. It has been shown to function as a scavenger for reactive oxidizing species thereby assisting in cellular defense against oxidative stress. In the present study, we characterized the presence of Ngb in the human cochlea. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin fixed celloidin human cochlea sections obtained from human temporal bones, using affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against Ngb. Thirty-six temporal bones were analyzed, 15 with normal otologic histories and 21 diagnosed with different inner ear pathologies. Ngb immunoreactivity (Ngb-IR) was consistently expressed in the neurons of spiral ganglia (SG) and supporting cells of the organ of Corti. There was a significant decrease of Ngb-IR in SGNs from specimens with inner ear pathologies when compared to normal specimens. In contrast, Ngb-IR in the organ of Corti did not show significant changes between pathological and normal specimens. The differential pattern of Ngb expression in these cochlear structures suggests that Ngb may participate in defense mechanisms in inner ear pathologies where oxidative stress is involved. labels: #Globins'
b'Erythropoiesis requires rapid and extensive hemoglobin production. Heme activates globin transcription and translation; therefore, heme synthesis must precede globin synthesis. As free heme is a potent inducer of oxidative damage, its levels within cellular compartments require stringent regulation. Mice lacking the heme exporter FLVCR1 have a severe macrocytic anemia; however, the mechanisms that underlie erythropoiesis dysfunction in these animals are unclear. Here, we determined that erythropoiesis failure occurs in these animals at the CFU-E/proerythroblast stage, a point at which the transferrin receptor (CD71) is upregulated, iron is imported, and heme is synthesized--before ample globin is produced. From the CFU-E/proerythroblast (CD71(+) Ter119(-) cells) stage onward, erythroid progenitors exhibited excess heme content, increased cytoplasmic ROS, and increased apoptosis. Reducing heme synthesis in FLVCR1-defient animals via genetic and biochemical approaches improved the anemia, implying that heme excess causes, and is not just associated with, the erythroid marrow failure. Expression of the cell surface FLVCR1 isoform, but not the mitochondrial FLVCR1 isoform, restored normal rbc production, demonstrating that cellular heme export is essential. Together, these studies provide insight into how heme is regulated to allow effective erythropoiesis, show that erythropoiesis fails when heme is excessive, and emphasize the importance of evaluating Ter119(-) erythroid cells when studying erythroid marrow failure in murine models. labels: #Globins'
b'Epigenome editing with the CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 platform is a promising technology for modulating gene expression to direct cell phenotype and to dissect the causal epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. Fusions of nuclease-inactive dCas9 to the Kr\xc3\xbcppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor (dCas9-KRAB) can silence target gene expression, but the genome-wide specificity and the extent of heterochromatin formation catalyzed by dCas9-KRAB are not known. We targeted dCas9-KRAB to the HS2 enhancer, a distal regulatory element that orchestrates the expression of multiple globin genes, and observed highly specific induction of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) at the enhancer and decreased chromatin accessibility of both the enhancer and its promoter targets. Targeted epigenetic modification of HS2 silenced the expression of multiple globin genes, with minimal off-target changes in global gene expression. These results demonstrate that repression mediated by dCas9-KRAB is sufficiently specific to disrupt the activity of individual enhancers via local modification of the epigenome. labels: #Globins'
b"OBJECTIVE: To identify the early changes of serum neuroglobin and Nogo-A concentrations and the relations to traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity and prognosis.METHODS: Serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 34 patients with TBI within the first 96\xe2\x80\x89h after injury. Comparative analysis combined with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and the 6-month prognosis of these patients was performed.RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between peak serum neuroglobin and Nogo-A concentrations and a patient's GCS score on admission (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001). The mean peak serum neuroglobin and Nogo-A concentrations were both significantly higher in patients with an unfavorable outcome at 6 months after injury (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05).CONCLUSIONS: Serum neuroglobin and Nogo-A levels could be suggested as biomarkers for predicting TBI severity and prognosis. labels: #Globins"
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a new member of the family of heme proteins and is specifically expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems in all vertebrates. In particular, the retina has a 100-fold higher concentration of Ngb than do other nervous tissues. The role of Ngb in the retina is yet to be clarified. Therefore, to understand the functional role of Ngb in the retina after optic nerve injury (ONI), we used two types of retina, from zebrafish and mice, which have permissible and non-permissible capacity for nerve regeneration after ONI, respectively. After ONI, the Ngb protein in zebrafish was upregulated in the amacrine cells within 3 days, whereas in the mouse retina, Ngb was downregulated in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) within 3 days. Zebrafish Ngb (z-Ngb) significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth in retinal explant culture. According to these results, we designed an overexpression experiment with the mouse Ngb (m-Ngb) gene in RGC-5 cells (retinal precursor cells). The excess of m-Ngb actually rescued RGC-5 cells under hypoxic conditions and significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth in cell culture. These data suggest that mammalian Ngb has positive neuroprotective and neuritogenic effects that induce nerve regeneration after ONI. labels: #Globins'
b'Biological significance of the globin protein family could be ascertained by their conservation through archaea to human. Globin(s) have been "classically" studied as oxygen binding protein(s), with recent implications in a host of other physiological functions. Drosophila melanogaster possesses three globin genes (glob1, glob2, glob3) located at different cytogenetic positions. We have performed a comprehensive investigation on the cellular expression profile and functional relevance of glob1 in Drosophila development. A profound level of maternally contributed glob1 gene products was found during early embryogenesis. Subsequently, commencement of zygotic transcription leads to its strong expression in somatic muscles, gut primordia, fat bodies, tracheal cells, etc. Similarly, dynamic expression of glob1 was evident in most of the larval tissues, interestingly with high expression in dividing cells. Reduced expression of glob1 leads to various impairments and lethality during embryogenesis and larval development. A substantial increase in level of cellular ROS was also evident due to reduced expression of glob1 which consequently leads to locomotor impairment and early aging in surviving adult flies. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report which demonstrates that in addition to oxygen management, globin gene(s) are also involved in regulating various aspects of development in Drosophila. labels: #Globins'
b'This study was aimed at understanding the effect of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia preconditioning (IHHP) on neuroglobin (NGB) and Bcl-2 expression in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats following global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham, IHHP control, global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR group), and IHHP+IR groups. The four-vessel occlusion rat model of Pulsinelli was used for the IR groups, in which the common carotid artery was occluded for 8 min before reperfusion. Thionin and immunohistochemical staining were used to observe NGB and Bcl-2 expression in the hippocampal CA1 region. Data was analyzed using the SPSS software. There was a significant increase in the number of surviving cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of the IHHP+IR group (119.5 \xc2\xb1 14) compared to the IR group (41.7 \xc2\xb1 3.8) (P<0.05). There was a significant increase in the expression of NGB and Bcl-2 in the hippocampal CA1 region of the IHHP+IR group compared to the IR group. By upregulating hippocampal NGB and Bcl-2 expression, IHHP may play a role in neural protection by reducing hippocampal neuronal apoptosis following IR. labels: #Globins'
b'Ferrous myoglobin was oxidized by sulfur trioxide anion radical (STAR) during the free radical chain oxidation of sulfite. Oxidation was inhibited by the STAR scavenger GSH and by the heme ligand CO. Bimolecular rate constants for the reaction of STAR with several ferrous globins and biomolecules were determined by kinetic competition. Reaction rate constants for myoglobin, hemoglobin, neuroglobin, and flavohemoglobin are large at 38, 120, 2,600, and \xe2\x89\xa5 7,500 \xc3\x97 10(6) m(-1) s(-1), respectively, and correlate with redox potentials. Measured rate constants for O2, GSH, ascorbate, and NAD(P)H are also large at \xe2\x88\xbc100, 10, 130, and 30 \xc3\x97 10(6) m(-1) s(-1), respectively, but nevertheless allow for favorable competition by globins and a capacity for STAR scavenging in vivo. Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking sulfite oxidase and deleted of flavohemoglobin showed an O2-dependent growth impairment with nonfermentable substrates that was exacerbated by sulfide, a precursor to mitochondrial sulfite formation. Higher O2 exposures inactivated the superoxide-sensitive mitochondrial aconitase in cells, and hypoxia elicited both aconitase and NADP(+)-isocitrate dehydrogenase activity losses. Roles for STAR-derived peroxysulfate radical, superoxide radical, and sulfo-NAD(P) in the mechanism of STAR toxicity and flavohemoglobin protection in yeast are suggested. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: The diverse clinical phenotype of hemoglobin E (HbE)/\xce\xb2-thalassemia has not only confounded clinicians in matters of patient management but has also led scientists to investigate the complex mechanisms involved in maintaining the delicate red cell environment where, even with apparent similarities of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genotypes, the phenotype tells a different story. The BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) protein is known to regulate \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin gene transcriptions during the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells. With the mutations involved in HbE/\xce\xb2-thalassemia disorder, we studied the role of BACH1 in compensating for the globin chain imbalance, albeit for fine-tuning purposes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 HbE/\xce\xb2-thalassemia samples were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and correlated with age, sex, red blood cell parameters, globin gene expressions, and some clinical data.RESULTS: The BACH1 expression among the \xce\xb2-thalassemia intermedia patients varied by up to 2-log differences and was positively correlated to age; \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2-, and \xce\xb3-globin gene expression level; and heme oxygenase 1 protein. BACH1 was also negatively correlated to reticulocyte level and had a significant correlation with splenectomy.CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the expression of BACH1 could be elevated as a compensatory mechanism to decrease the globin chain imbalance as well as to reduce the oxidative stress found in HbE/\xce\xb2-thalassemia. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), a 17 kDa monomeric protein, was initially described as a vertebrate oxygen-binding heme protein in 2000 and detected in metabolically active organs or cells, like the brain, peripheral nervous system as well as certain endocrine cells. A large array of initial experimental work reported that Ngb displayed a neuron restricted expression pattern in mammalian brains. However, growing evidence indicated astrocytes may also express Ngb under pathological conditions. To address the question whether human astrocytes express Ngb under traumatic insults, we investigated Ngb immuno-reactivity in post-mortem human brain tissues that died of acute, sub-acute and chronic brain trauma, respectively. We observed astrocytic Ngb expression in sub-acute and chronic traumatic brains rather than acute traumatic brains. Strikingly, the Ngb immuno-reactive astrocytes were still strongly detectable in groups that died 12 months after brain trauma. Our findings may imply an unexplored role of Ngb in astrocytes and the involved mechanisms were suggested to be further characterized. Also, therapeutic application of Ngb or Ngb-inducible chemical compounds in neuro-genesis or astrocytic scar forming can be expected. labels: #Globins'
b"Excessive accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (A\xce\xb2) has been considered as a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuronal apoptosis is one of the characteristics of AD, which is a possible mechanism underlying A\xce\xb2-induced neuronal neurotoxicity. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a newly discovered vertebrate heme protein that exhibits neuroprotective functions against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective action has not been determined. To investigate the potential neuroprotective roles and mechanisms of Ngb, transgenic AD mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pAPPswe were enrolled into the study. In vivo, overexpression of Ngb via intracerebroventricular injection with pNgb attenuated memory, cognitive impairment, and plaque generations. In pAPPswe transfected SH-SY5Y cells, Ngb not only decreased the generation of A\xce\xb242, but also attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis through suppressing the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 by Akt activating phosphorylation, which were restrained by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Our data indicate the anti-apoptotic property of Ngb may play a neuroprotective role against AD. labels: #Globins"
b'Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential and crucial for brain development, playing a role in growth and differentiation. Two globins named neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb) are located in the brain, and each one has different distribution and function: They seem to have similar action by providing O(2) for respiratory chain, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) protecting tissues against irreversible lesions. We aimed to investigate the influence of thyroid state in Ngb and Cygb metabolism in different brain regions and evaluate their responses in cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex (hereafter called as cortex) after supraphysiological doses at different time points of TH administration. Experiments were carried out in rats, divided in eight experimental groups Control (C), thyroidectomy (Tx), and thyroidectomy treated with jugular intravenous injection (i.v). T3 (100 \xce\xbcl/100 g) injection and sacrificed after 30, 60, 120 min and 6, 12 and 24 h. In cortex, we found increase in Ngb gene and protein expression in different time points compared to C group, however Cygb gene and protein expression were decreased. In hippocampus, Ngb and Cygb protein expression increased 24 h after i.v. T3 injection in comparison to Tx. In cerebellum, we found increased Ngb gene expression after 120 min, 6, 12 and 24 h after T3 administration compared to Tx, and in contrast, protein expression was found to be significantly increased only 12 and 24 h compared to Tx. Ngb and Cygb expression in brain is influenced by thyroid hormone state both by its lack or excess. labels: #Globins'
b'We characterized the peroxidase mechanism of recombinant rat brain cytoglobin (Cygb) challenged by hydrogen peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide and by cumene hydroperoxide. The peroxidase mechanism of Cygb is similar to that of myoglobin. Cygb challenged by hydrogen peroxide is converted to a Fe4+ oxoferryl \xcf\x80 cation, which is converted to Fe4+ oxoferryl and tyrosyl radical detected by direct continuous wave-electron paramagnetic resonance and by 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzene sulfonate spin trapping. When organic peroxides are used as substrates at initial reaction times, and given an excess of peroxide present, the EPR signals of the corresponding peroxyl radicals precede those of the direct tyrosyl radical. This result is consistent with the use of peroxide as a reducing agent for the recycling of Cygb high-valence species. Furthermore, we found that the Cygb oxidation by peroxides leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. This result suggests that Cygb possibly participates in the development of degenerative diseases; our findings also support the possible biological role of Cygb related to peroxidase activity. labels: #Globins'
b'Previous studies identifying the potential anti-apoptotic role of neuroglobin raise the question as to how cells might employ neuroglobin to avoid the apoptotic impact of acute hypoxia whilst also avoiding chronic enhancement of tumour formation. We show that under likely physiological conditions neuroglobin can take part in a futile redox cycle. Determination of the rate constants for each of the steps in the cycle allows us to mathematically model the steady state concentration of the active anti-apoptotic ferrous form of neuroglobin under various conditions. Under likely normal physiological conditions neuroglobin is shown to be present in the ferrous state at approximately 30% of its total cellular concentration. Under hypoxic conditions this rapidly rises to approximately 80%. Temporal analysis of this model indicates that the transition from low concentrations to high concentration of ferrous neuroglobin occurs on the seconds time scale. These findings indicate a potential control model for the anti-apoptotic activity of neuroglobin, under likely physiological conditions, whereby, in normoxic conditions, the anti-apoptotic activity of neuroglobin is maintained at a low level, whilst immediately a transition occurs to a hypoxic situation, as might arise during stroke, the anti-apoptotic activity is drastically increased. In this way the cell avoids unwanted increased oncogenic potential under normal conditions, but the rapid activation of neuroglobin provides anti-apoptotic protection in times of acute hypoxia. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Recent genomic information has revealed that neuroglobin and cytoglobin are the two principal lineages of vertebrate hemoglobins, with the latter encompassing the familiar myoglobin and \xce\xb1-globin/\xce\xb2-globin tetramer hemoglobin, and several minor groups. In contrast, very little is known about hemoglobins in echinoderms, a phylum of exclusively marine organisms closely related to vertebrates, beyond the presence of coelomic hemoglobins in sea cucumbers and brittle stars. We identified about 50 hemoglobins in sea urchin, starfish and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, and used Bayesian inference to carry out a molecular phylogenetic analysis of their relationship to vertebrate sequences, specifically, to assess the hypothesis that the neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages are also present in echinoderms.RESULTS: The genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus encodes several hemoglobins, including a unique chimeric 14-domain globin, 2 androglobin isoforms and a unique single androglobin domain protein. Other strongylocentrotid genomes appear to have similar repertoires of globin genes. We carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses of 52 hemoglobins identified in sea urchin, brittle star and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, using different multiple sequence alignment methods coupled with Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. The results demonstrate that there are two major globin lineages in echinoderms, which are related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages. Furthermore, the brittle star and sea cucumber coelomic hemoglobins appear to have evolved independently from the cytoglobin lineage, similar to the evolution of erythroid oxygen binding globins in cyclostomes and vertebrates.CONCLUSION: The presence of echinoderm globins related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages suggests that the split between neuroglobins and cytoglobins occurred in the deuterostome ancestor shared by echinoderms and vertebrates. labels: #Globins'
b"The globin-coupled histidine kinase, AfGcHK, is a part of the two-component signal transduction system from the soil bacterium Anaeromyxobacter sp. Fw109-5. Activation of its sensor domain significantly increases its autophosphorylation activity, which targets the His183 residue of its functional domain. The phosphate group of phosphorylated AfGcHK is then transferred to the cognate response regulator. We investigated the effects of selected variables on the autophosphorylation reaction's kinetics. The kcat values of the heme Fe(III)-OH(-), Fe(III)-cyanide, Fe(III)-imidazole, and Fe(II)-O2 bound active AfGcHK forms were 1.1-1.2 min(-1), and their Km(ATP) values were 18.9-35.4 \xce\xbcM. However, the active form bearing a CO-bound Fe(II) heme had a kcat of 1.0 min(-1) but a very high Km(ATP) value of 357 \xce\xbcM, suggesting that its active site structure differs strongly from the other active forms. The Fe(II) heme-bound inactive form had kcat and Km(ATP) values of 0.4 min(-1) and 78 \xce\xbcM, respectively, suggesting that its low activity reflects a low affinity for ATP relative to that of the Fe(III) form. The heme-free form exhibited low activity, with kcat and Km(ATP) values of 0.3 min(-1) and 33.6 \xce\xbcM, respectively, suggesting that the heme iron complex is essential for high catalytic activity. Overall, our results indicate that the coordination and oxidation state of the sensor domain heme iron profoundly affect the enzyme's catalytic activity because they modulate its ATP binding affinity and thus change its kcat/Km(ATP) value. The effects of the response regulator and different divalent metal cations on the autophosphorylation reaction are also discussed. labels: #Globins"
b'Hemoglobin transports oxygen in many organisms and consists of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin chains. Previously, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, we proposed that both \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globins of teleost could be classified into four groups. We also showed that the Hd-rR strain of medaka (Oryzias latipes) inhabiting southern Japan had all four groups of globin genes but that the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes of group III were pseudogenized (\xce\xb15(\xcf\x88\xce\xb1), \xce\xb25(\xcf\x88\xce\xb2)). Based on the small degree of nucleotide variations, the pseudogenization of \xce\xb25 was assumed to have occurred at a relatively late stage of evolution. Here, we compared the \xce\xb15(\xcf\x88\xce\xb1)-\xce\xb25(\xcf\x88\xce\xb2) of two other strains of O. latipes and found that both \xce\xb15(\xcf\x88\xce\xb1) and \xce\xb25(\xcf\x88\xce\xb2) of the northern Japanese and Korean strains were pseudogenized similar to those of Hd-rR. In a Philippine population (Oryzias luzonensis), \xce\xb15(\xcf\x88\xce\xb1) was also pseudogenized, but the structure was different from that of O. latipes, and \xce\xb25(\xcf\x88\xce\xb2) was almost deleted. Interestingly, an Indonesian population (Oryzias celebensis) had \xce\xb15 and \xce\xb25 genes that were deduced to be functional. Indeed, they were expressed from the young to adult development stages, and this expression pattern was consistent with the expression of \xce\xb12 and ad.\xce\xb11 in Hd-rR. Because \xce\xb12 and ad.\xce\xb11 in Hd-rR were assigned to groups I and II, respectively, we speculate that their expression patterns might be altered by pseudogenization of group III genes. These results provide a basis for further investigations of recruiting and changing expression patterns of one globin gene after pseudogenization of other globin genes during evolution. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We have previously shown that neuroglobin (Ngb) expression can be regulated by sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) exposure in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). However, the precise molecular mechanisms of Ngb action are largely unknown. Ras homolog (Rho) guanosine triphosphatases (Rho GTPases) are involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes, including cell cytotoxicity. It has been reported that Ngb can act as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitior (GDI) role to inactivate Rho GTPases. Therefore, we investigated Rho GTPases activation induced by NaAsO2 exposure in rat CGNs and effects of Rho GTPases activation on the cells. We also investigated the role of Ngb in this process.METHODS: Primary cultures of CGNs were prepared from 7-day-old Wistar rat pups. The cytotoxic effects of NaAsO2 on CGNs were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and TUNEL staining. RNA interference technology was used to silence Ngb, and the subsequent effects were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. Cdc42 and Rac1 activation were measured by pull-down assay and Western blot.RESULTS: NaAsO2 induced cytotoxicity in rat CGNs, increased GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases in the cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Cdc42 or Rac1 activity using the inhibitor ZCL278 or NSC23766 decreased apoptosis and increased cell viability in the cells exposed to NaAsO2. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we show that NaAsO2-induced cytotoxicity was exacerbated, activation of Cdc42 (GTP-Cdc42) and Rac1 (GTP-Rac1) was increased in Ngb RNA silencing cells.CONCLUSIONS: cytotoxic effects of NaAsO2 on rat CGNs is induced at least partly by Cdc42 and Rac1 activation, and Ngb can inhibit Cdc42 and Rac1 activation to play protective role in rat CGNs exposed to NaAsO2. labels: #Globins'
b'During physiological aerobic metabolism, the epidermis undergoes significant oxidative stress as a result of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain a balanced oxidative state, cells have developed protective antioxidant systems, and preliminary studies suggest that the transcriptional factor p63 is involved in cellular oxidative defence. Supporting this hypothesis, the \xce\x94Np63\xce\xb1 isoform of p63 is expressed at high levels in the proliferative basal layer of the epidermis. Here we identify the CYGB gene as a novel transcriptional target of \xce\x94Np63 that is involved in maintaining epidermal oxidative defence. The CYGB gene encodes cytoglobin, a member of the globin protein family, which facilitates the diffusion of oxygen through tissues and acts as a scavenger for nitric oxide or other ROS. By performing promoter activity assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and western blotting analyses, we confirm the direct regulation of CYGB by \xce\x94Np63\xce\xb1. We also demonstrate that CYGB has a protective role in proliferating keratinocytes grown under normal conditions, as well as in cells treated with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that \xce\x94Np63, through its target CYGB has an important role in the cellular antioxidant system and protects keratinocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The \xce\x94Np63-CYGB axis is also present in lung and breast cancer cell lines, indicating that CYGB-mediated ROS-scavenging activity may also have a role in epithelial tumours. In human lung cancer data sets, the p63-CYGB interaction significantly predicts reduction of patient survival. labels: #Globins'
b'The globin coupled heme containing adenylate cyclase from Leishmania major (HemAC-Lm) has two globin domains (globin-A and globin-B). Globin-B domain (210-360 amino acids) may guide the interaction between globin-A and adenylate cyclase domains for the regulation of catalysis. We investigated the role of globin-B domain in HemAC-Lm by constructing a series of mutants namely \xce\x94209 (209 amino acids deleted), \xce\x94360 (360 amino acids deleted), H161A, H311A and H311A-\xce\x94209. Spectroscopic data suggest that the \xce\x94209 and H311A-\xce\x94209 proteins to be Fe(2+)-O2 form and apo form, respectively, indicating that His311 residue in the globin-B domain is crucial for heme binding in \xce\x94209 protein. However, the H311A mutant is still of the Fe(2+)-O2 form whereas H161A mutant shows the apo form, indicating that only His161 residue in the globin-A domain is responsible for heme binding in full length enzyme. cAMP measurements suggest that the activities of \xce\x94360 and \xce\x94209 proteins were \xe2\x88\xbc10 and \xe2\x88\xbc1000 times lesser than full length enzyme, respectively, leading to the fact that globin-B domain inhibited catalysis rather than activation in absence of globin-A domain. These data suggest that the O2 bound globin-A domain in HemAC-Lm allows the best cooperation of the catalytic domain interactions to generate optimum cAMP. labels: #Globins'
b'Globins are haem-binding proteins with a conserved fold made up of \xce\xb1-helices and can possess diverse properties. A putative globin-coupled sensor from Methylacidiphilum infernorum, HGbRL, contains an N-terminal globin domain whose open and closed structures reveal an untypical dimeric architecture. Helices E and F fuse into an elongated helix, resulting in a novel site-swapped globin fold made up of helices A-E, hence the distal site, from one subunit and helices F-H, the proximal site, from another. The open structure possesses a large cavity binding an imidazole molecule, while the closed structure forms a unique Lys-His hexacoordinated species, with the first turn of helix E unravelling to allow Lys52(E10) to bind to the haem. Ligand binding induces reorganization of loop CE, which is stabilized in the closed form, and helix E, triggering a large conformational movement in the open form. These provide a mechanical insight into how a signal may be relayed between the globin domain and the C-terminal domain of HGbRL, a Roadblock/LC7 domain. Comparison with HGbI, a closely related globin, further underlines the high degree of structural versatility that the globin fold is capable of, enabling it to perform a diversity of functions. labels: #Globins'
b'Globins are small heme proteins that play an important role in oxygen supply, but may also have other functions. Globins offer a unique opportunity to study the functional evolution of genes and proteins. We have characterized the globin repertoire of two different turtle species: the Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii). In the genomes of both species, we have identified eight distinct globin types: hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, globin E, globin X, globin Y, and androglobin. Therefore, along with the coelacanth, turtles are so far the only known vertebrates with a full globin repertoire. This fact allows for the first time a comparative analysis of the expression of all eight globins in a single species. Phylogenetic analysis showed an early divergence of neuroglobin and globin X before the radiation of vertebrates. Among the other globins, cytoglobin diverged first, and there is a close relationship between myoglobin and globin E; the position of globin Y is not resolved. The globin E gene was selectively lost in the green anole, and the genes coding for globin X and globin Y were deleted in chicken. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that myoglobin, neuroglobin, and globin E are highly expressed with tissue-specific patterns, which are in line with their roles in the oxidative metabolism of the striated muscles, the brain, and the retina, respectively. Histochemical analyses showed high levels of globin E in the pigment epithelium of the eye. Globin E probably has a myoglobin-like role in transporting O2 across the pigment epithelium to supply in the metabolically highly active retina. labels: #Globins'
b'YddV is a newly discovered signal transducer heme protein that recognizes O2 and CO. Structural differences in the ligand-bound heme complex in YddV reflect variations in catalytic regulation by O2 and CO. Time-resolved step-scan (TRS(2)) FTIR studies of the wild type and of the important in oxygen recognition and stability of the heme Fe(II)-O2 complex L65M, L65T, Y43A, Y43F and Y43W mutants were performed to determine the site-specific protein dynamics following carbon monoxide (CO) photodissociation. These mutations were designed to perturb the electrostatic field near the iron-bound gaseous ligand (CO) and also to allow us to investigate the communication pathway between the distal residues of the protein and heme. TRS(2)-FTIR spectra of YddV-heme-CO show that the heme propionates are in protonated and deprotonated states. Moreover, the rate of decay of the vibrations of amide I is on a time scale that coincides with the rate of rebinding of CO, which suggests that there is coupling between ligation dynamics in the distal heme environment and (i) relaxation of the protein backbone and (ii) the environment sensed by the heme propionates. The fast recombination rates in L65M, L65T and Y43W imply a significant role of L65 and Y43 in controlling the ligand dynamics. The implications of these results with respect to the role of the heme propionates and the charged or proton-donating residues in the distal pocket, which are crucial for stabilizing bound gaseous ligands, are discussed. labels: #Globins'
b'Fast and accurate computation of protein stability is increasingly important for e.g. protein engineering and protein misfolding diseases, but no consensus methods exist for important proteins such as globins, and performance may depend on the type of structural input given. This paper reports benchmarking of six protein stability calculators (POPMUSIC 2.1, I-Mutant 2.0, I-Mutant 3.0, CUPSAT, SDM, and mCSM) against 134 experimental stability changes for mutations of sperm-whale myoglobin. Six different high-resolution structures were used to test structure sensitivity that may impair protein calculations. The trend accuracy of the methods decreased as I-Mutant 2.0 (R=0.64-0.65), SDM (R=0.57-0.60), POPMUSIC2.1 (R=0.54-0.57), I-Mutant 3.0 (R=0.53-0.55), mCSM (R=0.35-0.47), and CUPSAT (R=0.25-0.48). The mean signed errors increased as SDM<CUPSAT<I-Mutant 2.0<I-Mutant 3.0<POPMUSIC 2.1<mCSM. Mean absolute errors increased as I-Mutant 2.0<I-Mutant 3.0<POPMUSIC 2.1<CUPSAT<SDM<mCSM. Structural sensitivity increased as I-Mutant 3.0 (0.05)<I-Mutant 2.0 (0.09)<POPMUSIC 2.1 (0.12)<SDM (0.18)<mCSM (0.27)<CUPSAT (0.58). Leaving out heterogeneous experimental data did not change conclusions. The distinct performances reveal room for improvement, but I-Mutant 2.0 is proficient for this purpose, as further validated against a data set of related cytochrome c like proteins. The results also emphasize the importance of high-quality crystal structures and reveal structure-dependent effects even in the near-atomic resolution limit. labels: #Globins'
b'Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have previously been used for targeted genome editing in various organisms including Xenopus laevis. However, because of genomic polyploidization, X. laevis usually possess homeologous genes (homeologs) with quite similar sequences that make the analysis of gene function difficult. In the present study, we show methodological examples of targeted gene modification of X. laevis homeologs. The X. laevis cytoglobin gene (cygb) consists of two homeologs (xlcygba and xlcygbb), and molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that they have potentially different functions. Thus, there is a need to establish a method of homeolog-specific gene disruption to clarify gene functions in detail. Here, we show successful examples of homeolog-specific and simultaneous gene disruption for xlcygba and xlcygbb. We found that selective digestion can be performed with at least three mismatches in TALEN target sites in both homeologs. This report paves the way for the functional analyses of X. laevis homeologs, even those containing nearly identical sequences. labels: #Globins'
b'PURPOSE: Limb remote ischemic per-conditioning or post-conditioning has been shown to be neuroprotective after cerebral ischemic stroke. However, the effect of combining remote per-conditioning with post-conditioning on ischemic/reperfusion injury as well as the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored.METHODS: Here, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The limb ischemic stimulus was immediately applied after onset of focal ischemia (per-conditioning), followed by repeated short episodes of remote ischemia 24 hr after reperfusion (post-conditioning). The infarct volume, motor function, and the expression of neuroglobin (Ngb) were measured at different durations after reperfusion.RESULTS: We found that a single episode of limb remote per-conditioning afforded short-term protection, but combining repeated remote post-conditioning during the 14 days after reperfusion significantly ameliorated cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Interestingly, we also found that ischemic per- and post-conditioning significantly increased expression of Ngb, an oxygen-binding globin protein that has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective against stroke, at peri-infarct regions from day 1 to day 14 following ischemia/reperfusion.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the conventional per-conditioning combined with post-conditioning may be used as a novel neuroprotective strategy against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and Ngb seems to be one of the important players in limb remote ischemia-mediated neuroprotection. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (NGB) is a recently identified protein, which is localized in the neurons and retinal cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrates. It is hypothesized to function as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species, or as a stress-responsive sensor for signal transduction in hypoxic-ischemic brain insults. However, the mechanism underlying the physiological function of this protein remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the profiling of changes in the serum redox index of morphological features of the hippocampus and cortex, and of the expression of NGB and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\xce\xb1 (HIF-1\xce\xb1), are described in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The necrotic zone of the rat neural tissues increased in size with increasing reperfusion time, and different brain slices exhibited necrosis in different regions. The number of NGB-positive hippocampal and cortical cells, as well as NGB and HIF-1\xce\xb1 transcript and protein levels in the ischemic cortex, increased with increasing reperfusion time. NGB and HIF-1\xce\xb1 mRNA and protein levels peaked in the group that received reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO. These findings indicated that HIF-1\xce\xb1 may be involved in ischemic pathology in an MCAO model and that NGB expression may be upregulated. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased with increasing reperfusion time, indicating that the redox potential increased following MCAO. Serum SOD and MDA measurements may, therefore, be useful as biomarkers for the early detection of ischemic injury in a clinical setting. labels: #Globins'
b'Tanshinone IIA (TA) has been recently used to treat liver diseases. However, the poor water solubility and fast metabolism obstruct TA in to be used for the treatment of liver diseases. To overcome this, TA was encapsulated into globin to form nanoparticles (TA-Gb-NPs) by our self-assembling method. We evaluated their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, targeting ability to liver and antifibrotic effects. As a result, TA-Gb-NPs had a good hepatic targeting ability and achieved higher concentration and longer retention in liver than tanshinone IIA suspension (TA-S). Compared with TA-S, TA-Gb-NPs significantly improved serum biochemical parameters in thioacetamide (TAA) induced liver fibrosis mouse model. Furthermore, histological analysis of mouse liver slices revealed that TA-Gb-NPs could markedly reduce the fibrosis scores and attenuate the progression of the hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, the TA-Gb-NPs may be a good candidate for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. labels: #Globins'
b'Comparative analyses of vertebrate genomes continue to uncover a surprising diversity of genes in the globin gene superfamily, some of which have very restricted phyletic distributions despite their antiquity. Genomic analysis of the globin gene repertoire of cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes) should be especially informative about the duplicative origins and ancestral functions of vertebrate globins, as divergence between Chondrichthyes and bony vertebrates represents the most basal split within the jawed vertebrates. Here, we report a comparative genomic analysis of the vertebrate globin gene family that includes the complete globin gene repertoire of the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii). Using genomic sequence data from representatives of all major vertebrate classes, integrated analyses of conserved synteny and phylogenetic relationships revealed that the last common ancestor of vertebrates possessed a repertoire of at least seven globin genes: single copies of androglobin and neuroglobin, four paralogous copies of globin X, and the single-copy progenitor of the entire set of vertebrate-specific globins. Combined with expression data, the genomic inventory of elephant shark globins yielded four especially surprising findings: 1) there is no trace of the neuroglobin gene (a highly conserved gene that is present in all other jawed vertebrates that have been examined to date), 2) myoglobin is highly expressed in heart, but not in skeletal muscle (reflecting a possible ancestral condition in vertebrates with single-circuit circulatory systems), 3) elephant shark possesses two highly divergent globin X paralogs, one of which is preferentially expressed in gonads, and 4) elephant shark possesses two structurally distinct \xce\xb1-globin paralogs, one of which is preferentially expressed in the brain. Expression profiles of elephant shark globin genes reveal distinct specializations of function relative to orthologs in bony vertebrates and suggest hypotheses about ancestral functions of vertebrate globins. labels: #Globins'
b'The study assessed the effect of conscious halal slaughter and slaughter following minimal anesthesia on bleeding efficiency of goats and keeping quality of goat meat. Ten Boer cross bucks were divided into two groups and subjected to either halal slaughter without stunning (HS) or minimal anesthesia prior to slaughter (AS). The blood lost during exsanguination was measured. Residual blood was further quantified by determination of hemoglobin and myoglobin content in longissimus lumborum muscle. Storage stability of the meat was evaluated by microbiological analysis and lipid oxidation. Blood loss at exsanguination, residual hemoglobin and lipid oxidation were not significantly different (p>0.05) between HS and AS. Lactic acid bacteria was the only microbe that was significantly elevated after 24h of storage at 4\xc2\xb0C in the AS group. In conclusion, slaughtering goats under minimal anesthesia or fully conscious did not affect bleeding efficiency and keeping quality of goat meat. labels: #Globins'
b'Oxygen (O2) is required for cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent drug metabolism. Cytoglobin (CYGB) is a unique globin expressed exclusively in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). However, its role in O2-dependent metabolism in neighboring hepatocytes remains unknown. This study provides evidence that CYGB in HSCs is involved in acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol; APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in wild-type mice than in Cygb-null mice. Wild-type mice exhibited more severe hepatocyte necrosis around the central vein area compared with Cygb-null mice, thus indicating that CYGB deficiency protects against APAP-induced liver damage. Although no difference in the hepatic expression of CYP2E1, a key enzyme involved in APAP toxicity, was observed between wild-type and Cygb-null mice, the serum levels of the APAP metabolites cysteinyl-APAP and N-acetyl-cysteinyl-APAP were decreased in Cygb-null mice, suggesting reduced APAP metabolism in the livers of Cygb-null mice. In primary cultures, APAP-induced hepatocyte damage was increased by co-culturing with wild-type HSCs but not with Cygb-null HSCs. In addition, cell damage was markedly alleviated under low O2 condition (5% O2), suggesting the requirement of O2 for APAP toxicity. Carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury (CYP2E1-dependent), but not lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine-induced injury (CYP2E1-independent), was similarly alleviated in Cygb-null mice. Considering the function of CYGB as O2 carrier, these results strongly support the hypothesis that HSCs are involved in the CYP2E1-mediated xenobiotic activation by augmenting O2 supply to hepatocytes. In conclusion, CYGB in HSCs contributes to the CYP-mediated metabolism of xenobiotics in hepatocytes by supplying O2 for enzymatic oxidation. labels: #Globins'
b'Besides other mechanism(s) 17\xce\xb2-estradiol (E2) facilitates neuronal survival by increasing, via estrogen receptor \xce\xb2 (ER\xce\xb2), the levels of neuroglobin (NGB) an anti-apoptotic protein. In contrast, E2 could exert protective effects in cancer cells by activating apoptosis when the ER\xce\xb2 level prevails on that of ER\xce\xb1 as in colon cancer cell lines. These apparently contrasting results raise the possibility that E2-induced NGB up-regulation could regulate the ER\xce\xb2 activities shunning this receptor subtype to trigger an apoptotic cascade in neurons but not in non-neuronal cells. Here, human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (DLD-1) that only expresses ER\xce\xb2 and HeLa cells transiently transfected with ER\xce\xb2 encoding vector has been used to verify this hypothesis. In addition, neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells were used as positive control. Surprisingly, E2 also induced NGB up-regulation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, in DLD-1 cells. The ER\xce\xb2-mediated activation of p38/MAPK was necessary for this E2 effect. E2 induced NGB re-allocation in mitochondria where, subsequently to an oxidative stress injury (i.e., 100\xce\xbcM H2O2), NGB interacted with cytochrome c preventing its release into the cytosol and the activation of an apoptotic cascade. As a whole, these results demonstrate that E2-induced NGB up-regulation could act as an oxidative stress sensor, which does not oppose to the pro-apoptotic E2 effect in ER\xce\xb2-containing colon cancer cells unless a rise of oxidative stress occurs. These results support the concept that oxidative stress plays a critical role in E2-induced carcinogenesis and further open an important scenario to develop novel therapeutic strategies that target NGB against E2-related cancers. labels: #Globins'
b'Researchers are regularly interested in interpreting the multipartite structure of data entities according to their functional relationships. Data is often heterogeneous with intricately hidden inner structure. With limited prior knowledge, researchers are likely to confront the problem of transforming this data into knowledge. We develop a new framework, called heat-passing, which exploits intrinsic similarity relationships within noisy and incomplete raw data, and constructs a meaningful map of the data. The proposed framework is able to rank, cluster, and visualize the data all at once. The novelty of this framework is derived from an analogy between the process of data interpretation and that of heat transfer, in which all data points contribute simultaneously and globally to reveal intrinsic similarities between regions of data, meaningful coordinates for embedding the data, and exemplar data points that lie at optimal positions for heat transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the heat-passing framework for robustly partitioning the complex networks, analyzing the globin family of proteins and determining conformational states of macromolecules in the presence of high levels of noise. The results indicate that the methodology is able to reveal functionally consistent relationships in a robust fashion with no reference to prior knowledge. The heat-passing framework is very general and has the potential for applications to a broad range of research fields, for example, biological networks, social networks and semantic analysis of documents. labels: #Globins'
b'We report the structural and biochemical characterization of GLB-33, a putative neuropeptide receptor that is exclusively expressed in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This unique chimeric protein is composed of a 7-transmembrane domain (7TM), GLB-33 7TM, typical of a G-protein-coupled receptor, and of a globin domain (GD), GLB-33 GD. Comprehensive sequence similarity searches in the genome of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, revealed a chimeric protein that is similar to a Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide neuropeptide receptor. The three-dimensional structures of the separate domains of both species and of the full-length proteins were modeled. The 7TM domains of both proteins appeared very similar, but the globin domain of the A. suum receptor surprisingly seemed to lack several helices, suggesting a novel truncated globin fold. The globin domain of C. elegans GLB-33, however, was very similar to a genuine myoglobin-type molecule. Spectroscopic analysis of the recombinant GLB-33 GD showed that the heme is pentacoordinate when ferrous and in the hydroxide-ligated form when ferric, even at neutral pH. Flash-photolysis experiments showed overall fast biphasic CO rebinding kinetics. In its ferrous deoxy form, GLB-33 GD is capable of reversibly binding O2 with a very high affinity and of reducing nitrite to nitric oxide faster than other globins. Collectively, these properties suggest that the globin domain of GLB-33 may serve as a highly sensitive oxygen sensor and/or as a nitrite reductase. Both properties are potentially able to modulate the neuropeptide sensitivity of the neuronal transmembrane receptor. labels: #Globins'
b'This study was conducted to clarify the role of cytoglobin (Cygb), a globin expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), in the development of liver fibrosis and cancer in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Cygb expression was assessed in patients with NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mouse NASH model was generated in Cygb-deficient (Cygb(-/-)) or wild-type (WT) mice by giving a choline-deficient amino acid-defined diet and, in some of them, macrophage deletion and N-acetyl cysteine treatment were used. Primary-cultured mouse HSCs isolated from WT (HSCs(Cygb-wild)) or Cygb(-/-) (HSCs(Cygb-null)) mice were characterized. As results, the expression of CYGB was reduced in patients with NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma. Choline-deficient amino acid treatment for 8 weeks induced prominent inflammation and fibrosis in Cygb(-/-) mice, which was inhibited by macrophage deletion. Surprisingly, at 32 weeks, despite no tumor formation in the WT mice, all Cygb(-/-) mice developed liver cancer, which was ameliorated by N-acetyl cysteine treatment. Altered expression of 31 genes involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species was notable in Cygb(-/-) mice. Both HSCs(Cygb-null) and Cygb siRNA-transfected-HSCs(Cygb-wild) exhibited the preactivation condition. Our findings provide important insights into the role that Cygb, expressed in HSCs during liver fibrosis, plays in cancer development with NASH. labels: #Globins'
b"Heme-A\xce\xb2 complexes are known to produce toxic partially reduced oxygen species (PROS), catalyze oxidation of neurotransmitters and have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroglobin (Ngb) play a crucial neuroprotective role against oxidative damage, hypoxic injuries, stroke and apoptosis of neuronal cells. In this study, the interaction of heme-A\xce\xb2 with apoNeuroglobin (apoNgb) has been investigated using a combination of spectroscopic techniques. Absorption and resonance Raman data confirm that apoNgb can uptake heme from heme-A\xce\xb2 and constitute a six-coordinate low-spin ferric heme-active site identical to that of Ngb. ApoNgb can also uptake heme from reduced heme-A\xce\xb2 resulting in the formation of ferrous Ngb. The rate of the heme transfer reaction has been found to be of the order of 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). The reaction is faster for oxidized heme-A\xce\xb2 than the reduced form. The amount of PROS formation by heme-A\xce\xb2 complexes has been found to diminish drastically after reaction with apoNgb. ApoNgb can also sequester ligand-bound heme from heme-A\xce\xb2, e.g., the CO-bound heme from heme-A\xce\xb2-CO complex resulting in the formation of Ngb-CO complex. Additionally, ApoNgb can sequester heme from self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of surface-bound heme-A\xce\xb2 formed over Au surface. This heme sequestration by apoNgb from heme-A\xce\xb2 not only diminishes heme-induced toxicity but more significantly it produces Ngb which has well-documented neuroprotective role and can thereby potentially reduce risks associated with AD. labels: #Globins"
b'Protein-based nanoparticles hold great promises in both preclinical and clinical practices, such as oncology diagnosis and treatment, because of their high biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, the complicated preparation and lack of targeting specific cells or tissues may limit their further uses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel replacing method for preparing dual-functional protein nanocarrier, such that one function is capable of encapsulating small molecule into protein, whereas the other function is cable of recognizing CD163 receptor [hemoglobin (Hb) scavenger receptor]. In this study, Hb was chosen as the targeting drug carrier. First, the heme group in the Hb was removed and replaced by paclitaxel (PTX) to form nanoparticles (Gb-NPs-PTX). The resulted Gb-NPs-PTX showed spherical shape and their diameter could be controlled in the range of 120-160 nm by altering the ratio of PTX to Hb. The binding activity of Gb-NPs-PTX to CD163 was confirmed by cell uptake in CD163(+) Chinese hamster ovary cells. Results in vivo also showed a CD163-dependent tissue accumulation of Gb-NPs-PTX in mice. In summary, by using the novel replacing method, PTX could be easily encapsulated into Hb nanoparticles and the targeting effects of Hb could also be kept. labels: #Globins'
b'The energy-yielding pathways that provide the large amounts of metabolic energy required by inner ear sensorineural cells are poorly understood. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a neuron-specific hemoprotein of the globin family, which is suggested to be involved in oxidative energy metabolism. Here, we present quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical, and Western blot evidence that neuroglobin is highly expressed in the mouse and rat cochlea. For primary cochlea neurons, Ngb expression is limited to the subpopulation of type I spiral ganglion cells, those which innervate inner hair cells, while the subpopulation of type II spiral ganglion cells which innervate the outer hair cells do not express Ngb. We further investigated Ngb distribution in rat, mouse, and human auditory brainstem centers, and found that the cochlear nuclei and superior olivary complex (SOC) also express considerable amounts of Ngb. Notably, the majority of olivocochlear neurons, those which provide efferent innervation of outer hair cells as identified by neuronal tract tracing, were Ngb-immunoreactive. We also observed that neuroglobin in the SOC frequently co-localized with neuronal nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme responsible for nitric oxide production. Our findings suggest that neuroglobin is well positioned to play an important physiologic role in the oxygen homeostasis of the peripheral and central auditory nervous system, and provides the first evidence that Ngb signal differentiates the central projections of the inner and outer hair cells. labels: #Globins'
b'PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Neuroglobin (NGB) is a known neuroprotector and is up-regulated after ischaemia-hypoxia brain damage. However, no studies have investigated NGB levels after ischaemic pre-conditioning and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This study subjected rats to different ischaemic pre-conditioning and MCAO regimens and assayed NGB levels in the hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus by immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot.MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: After 30 minutes of ischaemic pre-conditioning, the number of NGB-positive cells and NGB levels in the hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus were increased with longer reperfusion times, peaked at 24-hours reperfusion and slightly decreased at 48-hours reperfusion. Similarly, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NGB were also up-regulated; they peaked at 24-hours reperfusion and slightly decreased at 48-hours reperfusion.CONCLUSIONS: NGB may regulate neuroprotection against ischaemia and hypoxia-mediated brain damage after ischaemic pre-conditioning. The results provide additional evidence supporting the utility of ischaemic pre-conditioning and help elucidate its potential regulatory mechanism. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered globin with preferential localization to neurons. Growing evidence indicates that Ngb has distinct physiological functions separate from the oxygen storage and transport roles of other globins, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin. We found increased ATP production and decreased glycolysis in Ngb-overexpressing immortalized murine hippocampal cell line (HT-22), in parallel with inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, lipid and glycogen content was increased in Ngb-overexpressing HT-22 cells. AMPK signaling was also inhibited in the brain and heart from Ngb-overexpressing transgenic mice. Although Ngb overexpression did not change glycogen content in whole brain, glycogen synthase was activated in cortical neurons of Ngb-overexpressing mouse brain and Ngb overexpression primary neurons. Moreover, lipid and glycogen content was increased in hearts derived from Ngb-overexpressing mice. These findings suggest that Ngb functions as a metabolic regulator and enhances cellular anabolism through the inhibition of AMPK signaling. labels: #Globins'
b'Spinal manipulation (SM) is a manual therapy technique frequently applied to treat musculoskeletal disorders because of its analgesic effects. It is defined by a manual procedure involving a directed impulse to move a joint past its physiologic range of movement (ROM). In this sense, to exceed the physiologic ROM of a joint could trigger tissue damage, which might represent an adverse effect associated with spinal manipulation. The present work tries to explore the presence of tissue damage associated with SM through the damage markers analysis. Thirty healthy subjects recruited at the University of Ja\xc3\xa9n were submitted to a placebo SM (control group; n = 10), a single lower cervical manipulation (cervical group; n = 10), and a thoracic manipulation (n = 10). Before the intervention, blood samples were extracted and centrifuged to obtain plasma and serum. The procedure was repeated right after the intervention and two hours after the intervention. Tissue damage markers creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin-I, myoglobin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and aldolase were determined in samples. Statistical analysis was performed through a 3 \xc3\x97 3 mixed-model ANOVA. Neither cervical manipulation nor thoracic manipulation did produce significant changes in the CPK, LDH, CRP, troponin-I, myoglobin, NSE, or aldolase blood levels. Our data suggest that the mechanical strain produced by SM seems to be innocuous to the joints and surrounding tissues in healthy subjects. labels: #Globins'
b'Earlier kinetics studies on cytoglobin did not assign functional properties to specific structural forms. Here, we used defined monomeric and dimeric forms and cysteine mutants to show that an intramolecular disulfide bond (C38-C83) alters the dissociation rate constant of the intrinsic histidine (H81) (\xe2\x88\xbc1000 fold), thus controlling binding of extrinsic ligands. Through time-resolved spectra we have unequivocally assigned CO binding to hexa- and penta-coordinate forms and have made direct measurement of histidine rebinding following photolysis. We present a model that describes how the cysteine redox state of the monomer controls histidine dissociation rate constants and hence extrinsic ligand binding. labels: #Globins'
b"A needlestick injury to cerebral cortex causes immediate damage along the track of the needle (haemorrhage, cell death) and sequelae (the formation of amyloid-positive plaques, extracellular deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, microglial proliferation, astrogliosis) that are long lasting, and mimic the neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease. We report here that the same injury also elicits a distinctive response in the cortex flanking (up to 1mm from) the direct injury. Needlestick injury was made in the neo- and hippocampal cortex of young (3 months) healthy Sprague-Dawley rats. After survival times of up to 7d, the response of the cortex was assessed with histology, immunohistochemistry and stereology. Uptake of FluoroJade B at 1d survival and labelling for 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) gave measures of membrane damage; labelling for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) gave a measure of DNA damage, and labelling with the AT8 antibody gave a measure of the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Two probes, for neuroglobin and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), gave measures of a self-protective response in the tissue. Results indicate that neurones in the flanking region are damaged by the nearby lesion, and within 1d upregulate self-protective mechanisms. Over the next 6d survival, evidence of neuronal damage reduces markedly. In summary, cells in the region flanking a lesion are stressed by the lesion, and react to the stress with a self-protective response, which prevents their death. This response may be an important, previously unrecognised feature of brain tissue close to a focus of stress, such as a microhaemorrhage. labels: #Globins"
b'1-Bromopropane (1-BP) is used as a substitute for ozone-depleting solvents (ODS) in industrial applications. 1-BP could display central nervous system (CNS) neurotoxicity manifested by cognitive dysfunction. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is an endogenous neuroprotectant and is predominantly expressed in the nervous system. The present study aimed to investigate Ngb involvement in CNS neurotoxicity induced by 1-BP in rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=14) and treated with 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg bw 1-BP, respectively, by gavage for consecutive 12 days. Rats displayed cognitive dysfunction dose-dependently through Morris water maze (MWM) test. Significant neuron loss in layer 5 of the prelimbic cortex (PL) was observed. Moreover, 1-BP decreased Ngb protein level in cerebral cortex and Ngb decrease was significantly positively correlated with cognitive dysfunction. Glutathione (GSH) content, GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) activity decreased in cerebral cortex, coupled with the increase in GSSG content. GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio decrease were significantly positively correlated with cortical Ngb decrease. Additionally, levels of N-epsilon-hexanoyl-lysine (HEL) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins in cerebral cortex of 1-BP-treated rats increased significantly. In conclusion, it was suggested that 1-BP resulted in decreased endogenous neuroprotectant Ngb in cerebral cortex, which might play an important role in CNS neurotoxicity induced by 1-BP and that 1-BP-induced oxidative stress in cerebral cortex might partly be responsible for Ngb decrease. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a six-coordinate globin that can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide. Although this reaction is common to heme proteins, the molecular interactions in the heme pocket that regulate this reaction are largely unknown. We have shown that the H64L Ngb mutation increases the rate of nitrite reduction by 2000-fold compared to that of wild-type Ngb [Tiso, M., et al. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 18277-18289]. Here we explore the effect of distal heme pocket mutations on nitrite reduction. For this purpose, we have generated mutations of Ngb residues Phe28(B10), His64(E7), and Val68(E11). Our results indicate a dichotomy in the reactivity of deoxy five- and six-coordinate globins toward nitrite. In hemoglobin and myoglobin, there is a correlation between faster rates and more negative potentials. However, in Ngb, reaction rates are apparently related to the distal pocket volume, and redox potential shows a poor relationship with the rate constants. This suggests a relationship between the nitrite reduction rate and heme accessibility in Ngb, particularly marked for His64(E7) mutants. In five-coordinate globins, His(E7) facilitates nitrite reduction, likely through proton donation. Conversely, in Ngb, the reduction mechanism does not rely on the delivery of a proton from the histidine side chain, as His64 mutants show the fastest reduction rates. In fact, the rate observed for H64A Ngb (1120 M(-1) s(-1)) is to the best of our knowledge the fastest reported for a heme nitrite reductase. These differences may be related to a differential stabilization of the iron-nitrite complexes in five- and six-coordinate globins. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a recently discovered heme-containing protein located predominantly in the mammalian brain. This paper for the first time presents the data on neuroglobin distribution in human cerbellum using immunohistochemistry. Neuroglobin immunoreactivity in the cerebellum was found in all the cases studied (n = 7), although its intensity varied. Distinct reaction was found in Purkinje cells and the areas of cerebellar glomeruli. labels: #Globins'
b"Aerobic animals constantly monitor and adapt to changes in O2 levels. The molecular mechanisms involved in sensing O2 are, however, incompletely understood. Previous studies showed that a hexacoordinated globin called GLB-5 tunes the dynamic range of O2-sensing neurons in natural C. elegans isolates, but is defective in the N2 lab reference strain (McGrath et al., 2009; Persson et al., 2009). GLB-5 enables a sharp behavioral switch when O2 changes between 21 and 17%. Here, we show that GLB-5 also confers rapid behavioral and cellular recovery from exposure to hypoxia. Hypoxia reconfigures O2-evoked Ca(2+) responses in the URX O2 sensors, and GLB-5 enables rapid recovery of these responses upon re-oxygenation. Forward genetic screens indicate that GLB-5's effects on O2 sensing require PDL-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian PrBP/PDE6\xce\xb4 protein. In mammals, PDE6\xce\xb4 regulates the traffic and activity of prenylated proteins (Zhang et al., 2004; Norton et al., 2005). PDL-1 promotes localization of GCY-33 and GCY-35, atypical soluble guanylate cyclases that act as O2 sensors, to the dendritic endings of URX and BAG neurons, where they colocalize with GLB-5. Both GCY-33 and GCY-35 are predicted to be prenylated. Dendritic localization is not essential for GCY-35 to function as an O2 sensor, but disrupting pdl-1 alters the URX neuron's O2 response properties. Functional GLB-5 can restore dendritic localization of GCY-33 in pdl-1 mutants, suggesting GCY-33 and GLB-5 are in a complex. Our data suggest GLB-5 and the soluble guanylate cyclases operate in close proximity to sculpt O2 responses. labels: #Globins"
b'Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder is due to a single amino acid substitution on the beta chain of hemoglobin, and is characterized by anemia, severe infections, acute and chronic pain, and multi-organ damage. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is dedicated to support basic, translational and clinical science research to improve care and ultimately, to find a cure for SCD that causes such suffering. This report provides a detailed analysis of grants funded by the NIH for SCD research in Fiscal Years 2007 through 2013. During this period, the NIH supported 247 de novo grants totaling $272,210,367 that address various aspects of SCD. 83% of these funds supported research project grants investigating the following 5 scientific themes: Pathology of Sickle Red Blood Cells; Globin Gene Expression; Adhesion and Vascular Dysfunction; Neurological Complications and Organ-specific Dysfunction; and Pain Management and Intervention. The remaining 17% of total funds supported career development and training grants; Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants; large Center grants; and Conference grants. Further analysis showed that the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is the largest funder of SCD research within NIH with 67% of total grants, contributing 77% of total funds; followed by the National Institute for Digestive Diseases and Kidney (NIDDK) that is funding 19% of grants, contributing 13% of total funds. The remaining 14% of grants totaling 10% of the funds were supported by all other NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs) combined. In summary, the NIH is using multiple funding mechanisms to support a sickle cell disease research agenda that is intended to advance the detection, treatment, and cure of this debilitating genetic disease. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Myoglobin (Mb) and neuroglobin (Ngb) are representative members of pentacoordinated and bis-histidyl, hexacoordinated globins. In spite of their low sequence identity, they show surprisingly similar three-dimensional folds. The ability of Ngb to form a hexacoordinated bis-histidyl complex with the distal HisE7 has a strong impact on ligand affinity. The factors governing such different behaviors have not been completely understood yet, even though they are extremely relevant to establish structure-function relationships within the globin superfamily.METHODS: In this work we generated chimeric proteins by swapping a previously identified regulatory segment - the CD region - and evaluated comparatively the structural and functional properties of the resulting proteins by molecular dynamics simulations, and spectroscopic and kinetic investigations.RESULTS: Our results show that chimeric proteins display heme coordination properties displaced towards those expected for the corresponding CD region. In particular, in the absence of exogenous ligands, chimeric Mb is found as a partially hexacoordinated bis-histidyl species, whereas chimeric Ngb shows a lower equilibrium constant for forming a hexacoordinated bis-histidyl species.CONCLUSIONS: While these results confirm the regulatory role of the CD region for bis-histidyl hexacoordination, they also suggest that additional sources contribute to fine tune the equilibrium. General significance Globins constitute a ubiquitous group of heme proteins widely found in all kingdoms of life. These findings raise challenging questions regarding the structure-function relationships in these proteins, as bis-histidyl hexacoordination emerges as a novel regulatory mechanism of the physiological function of globins. labels: #Globins'
b'he aim of this study was to obtain a cell-penetrating cytoglobin (Cygb), which combines the transmembrane function of cell-penetrating peptides TAT with the anti-aging and anti-fibrotic role of cytoglobin. The Cygb gene was complexed with TAT gene by overlapping PCR, inserted into the vector pET22b to construct the recombinant expression plasmid (pET22b-TAT-Cygb) and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The fusion protein TAT-Cygb, whose expression was induced by lactose, was purified by CM Sepharose Fast Flow Protocol and verified by Western blotting. The final TAT-Cygb had a molecular weight of 23 kDa with 95% purity, as shown by SDS-PAGE. As demonstrated by bioactivity experiments, TAT-Cygb exhibited a high specific peroxidase activity up to (422.30 \xc2\xb1 0.36) U/mg. Both TAT-Cygb and Cygb pretreatment group could protect Hacat cells against oxidation of H2O2, but only TAT-Cygb treatment group could remedy cells injuried by H2O2 (RGR = 98%), which was significantly different from Cygb treatment group (RGR = 79%). We successfully obtained the bioactive and cell-penetrating fusion protein TAT-Cygb that has the potential application in anti-aging, anti-fibrotic and anti-cancer. labels: #Globins'
b'Co-treatment of neuroprotective reagents may improve the therapeutic efficacy of hypothermia in protecting neurons during ischemic stroke. This study aimed to find promising drugs that enhance the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia (MH). 26 candidate drugs were selected based on different targets. Primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) to induce neuronal damage, followed by either single treatment (a drug or MH) or a combination of a drug and MH. Results showed that, compared with single treatment, combination of MH with brain derived neurotrophic factor, glibenclamide, dizocilpine, human urinary kallidinogenase or neuroglobin displayed higher proportion of neuronal cell viability. The latter three drugs also caused less apoptosis rate in combined treatment. Furthermore, co-treatment of those three drugs and MH decreased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular calcium accumulation, as well as stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), indicating the combined neuroprotective effects are probably via inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Taken together, the study suggests that combined treatment with hypothermia and certain neuroprotective reagents provide a better protection against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Transcriptome analysis of porcine whole blood has several applications, which include deciphering genetic mechanisms for host responses to viral infection and vaccination. The abundance of alpha- and beta-globin transcripts in blood, however, impedes the ability to cost-effectively detect transcripts of low abundance. Although protocols exist for reduction of globin transcripts from human and mouse/rat blood, preliminary work demonstrated these are not useful for porcine blood Globin Reduction (GR). Our objectives were to develop a porcine specific GR protocol and to evaluate the GR effects on gene discovery and sequence read coverage in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments.RESULTS: A GR protocol for porcine blood samples was developed using RNase H with antisense oligonucleotides specifically targeting porcine hemoglobin alpha (HBA) and beta (HBB) mRNAs. Whole blood samples (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8912) collected in Tempus tubes were used for evaluating the efficacy and effects of GR on RNA-seq. The HBA and HBB mRNA transcripts comprised an average of 46.1% of the mapped reads in pre-GR samples, but those reads reduced to an average of 8.9% in post-GR samples. Differential gene expression analysis showed that the expression level of 11,046 genes were increased, whereas 34 genes, excluding HBA and HBB, showed decreased expression after GR (FDR<0.05). An additional 815 genes were detected only in post-GR samples.CONCLUSIONS: Our porcine specific GR primers and protocol minimize the number of reads of globin transcripts in whole blood samples and provides increased coverage as well as accuracy and reproducibility of transcriptome analysis. Increased detection of low abundance mRNAs will ensure that studies relying on transcriptome analyses do not miss information that may be vital to the success of the study. labels: #Globins'
b'One of the factors affecting the degree of severity in \xce\xb2-thalassemia disease is the presence of unmatched \xce\xb1-hemoglobin chains. Thus, the expression levels of globin genes in reticulocytes of \xce\xb2-thalassemia subjects were measured using quantitative RT-PCR, demonstrating that \xce\xb1/\xce\xb2 globin mRNA ratio, as well as levels of \xce\xb3-globin mRNA and Hb F, increased with progressing degree of \xce\xb2 globin synthesis defect. The levels of \xce\xb3-globin mRNA and Hb F could not be directly correlated with severity of \xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E disease due to a low statistical power of this analysis. Higher levels of Hb E were present, however, in clinically mild patients, as compared to moderately severe \xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E subjects. This suggests that in \xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E disease, elevation of Hb E level through enhancing correctly spliced \xce\xb2(E)-globin mRNA offers another approach in ameliorating disease severity. In addition, co-inheritance of \xce\xb1-thalassemia 2 trait in \xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E subjects was associated with milder outcome compared with those with the same \xce\xb2-thalassemia genotypes, confirming the notion of the beneficial effect of a more balanced \xce\xb1:\xce\xb2-globin chain ratio. labels: #Globins'
b'In order to investigate the potential application of blood biomarkers as surrogate indicators of carcinogen-adduct formation in target-specific tissues, temporal formation of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-associated DNA adducts, protein adducts, or lipid damage in target tissues such as lung, liver, and kidney was compared with globin adduct formation or plasma lipid damage in blood after continuous intraperitoneal (ip) injection of [(3)H]BaP into female ICR mice for 7 d. Following treatment with [(3)H]BaP, formation of [(3)H]BaP-DNA or -protein adducts in lung, liver, and kidney increased linearly, and persisted thereafter. This finding was similar to the observed effects on globin adduct formation and plasma lipid damage in blood. The lungs contained a higher level of DNA adducts than liver or kidneys during the treatment period. Further, the rate of cumulative adduct formation in lung was markedly greater than that in liver. Treatment with a single dose of [(3)H]BaP indicated that BaP-globin adduct formation and BaP-lipid damage in blood reached a peak 48 h after treatment. Overall, globin adduct formation and lipid damage in blood were significantly correlated with DNA adduct formation in the target tissues. These data suggest that peripheral blood biomarkers, such as BaP-globin adduct formation or BaP-lipid damage, may be useful for prediction of target tissue-specific DNA adduct formation, and for risk assessment after exposure. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexa-co-ordinate haem protein from the globin superfamily with a physiological function that is unclear. We have previously reported that the haem co-ordination is changed in the presence of lipids, potentially transforming the redox properties of the protein and hence the function of Cygb in vivo. Recent research suggests that the protein can exist in a number of states depending on the integrity and position of disulfide bonds. In the present study, we show that the monomeric protein with an internal disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues Cys38 and Cys83, interacts with lipids to induce a change in haem co-ordination. The dimeric protein with intermolecular disulfide bonds and monomeric protein without an intramolecular disulfide bond does not exhibit these changes in haem co-ordination. Furthermore, monomeric Cygb with an intramolecular disulfide bond has significantly different properties, oxidizing lipid membranes and binding ligands more rapidly as compared with the other forms of the protein. The redox state of these cysteine residues in vivo is therefore highly significant and may be a mechanism to modulate the biochemical properties of the haem under conditions of stress. labels: #Globins'
b'Recently, we reported that human neuroglobin (NGB) is a new player in the signal transduction pathways that lead to 17\xce\xb2-estradiol (E2)-induced neuron survival. Indeed, E2 induces in neuron mitochondria the enhancement of NGB level, which in turn impairs the activation of a pro-apoptotic cascade. Nowadays, the existence of a similar pathway activated by E2 in non-neuronal cells is completely unknown. Here, the role of E2-induced NGB upregulation in tumor cells is reported. E2 induced the upregulation of NGB in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MCF-7, HepG2, SK-N-BE, and HeLa cells transfected with estrogen receptor \xce\xb1 (ER\xce\xb1), whereas E2 was unable to modulate the NGB expression in the ER\xce\xb1-devoid HeLa cells. Both transcriptional and extranuclear ER\xce\xb1 signals were required for the E2-dependent upregulation of NGB in MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines. E2 stimulation modified NGB intracellular localization, inducing a significant reduction of NGB in the nucleus with a parallel increase of NGB in the mitochondria in both HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. Remarkably, E2 pretreatment did not counteract the H2O2-induced caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) cleavage, as well as Bcl-2 overexpression in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells in which NGB was stably silenced by using shRNA lentiviral particles, highlighting the pivotal role of NGB in E2-induced antiapoptotic pathways in cancer cells. Present results indicate that the E2-induced NGB upregulation in cancer cells could represent a defense mechanism of E2-related cancers rendering them insensitive to oxidative stress. As a whole, these data open new avenues to develop therapeutic strategies against E2-related cancers. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is an emerging tumor suppressor gene silenced by promoter hypermethylation in many human tumors. So far, the precise molecular mechanism underlying its tumor suppressive function remains poorly understood. Here, we identified Cygb as a genotoxic stress-responsive hemoprotein upregulated upon sensing cellular DNA damage. Our studies demonstrated that Cygb physically associates with and stabilizes p53, a key cellular DNA damage signaling factor. We provide evidence that Cygb extends the half-life of p53 by blocking its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. We show that, upon DNA damage, cells overexpressing Cygb displayed proliferation defect by rapid accumulation of p53 and its target gene p21, while Cygb knockdown cells failed to efficiently arrest in G1 phase in response to DNA insult. These results suggest a possible involvement of Cygb in mediating cellular response to DNA damage and thereby contributing in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Our study thus presents a novel insight into the mechanistic role of Cygb in tumor suppression. labels: #Globins'
b'PURPOSE: To investigate the possible association of oxidative stress with keratoconus (KC), we estimated the changes in relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content.METHODS: The study included 119 patients with KC and 208 controls matched for gender, ethnicity, and systemic disease status. We selected controls who were older than the patients since the mtDNA copy number tends to increase with age. The age mean (standard deviation) was 26.4(7.6) and 54.5(14.4) years for the patients and controls, respectively. The relative mtDNA copy number was estimated with the real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method using ND1 as the mtDNA gene and human globulin (HGB; also known as the cytoglobin gene, CYGB) as the reference single-copy nuclear gene.RESULTS: The mean relative mtDNA content was significantly higher in patients with KC (1.20\xc2\xb10.45) than in the normal control subjects (1.04\xc2\xb10.36; p = 0.0004). Subjects with high mtDNA content (>1.259, i.e., greater than 75(th) percentile) were at an increased risk of the disease (odds ratio = 2.62, 95% confidence interval = 1.40 to 4.89; p =0.0025).CONCLUSIONS: Increased mtDNA content in patients with KC may indicate mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and thus mitochondrial-abnormality involvement. labels: #Globins'
b'Non photochemical quenching is a fundamental mechanism in photosynthesis, which protects plants against excess excitation energy and is of crucial importance for their survival and fitness. In the last decades hundreds of papers have appeared that describe the role of antenna regulation in protection or the so called qE response. However, the exact quenching site is still obscure. Previously overlooked features of the antenna may provide hints towards the elucidation of its functionality and of the quenching mechanism. Recently it was demonstrated that the catalytic domain of human myoglobin that binds the pigment (i.e. heme) is similar in structure to the domain of the light harvesting complex II of pea that binds Chl a 614 (former known as b3). In addition, it is well accepted that conformational changes of the chlorophyll macrocycle result in reversible changes of fluorescence (the lowest fluorescence corresponds to non planar macrocycle). Here we put forward a hypothesis regarding the molecular mechanism that leads to the formation of a quenching center inside the antenna proteins. Our main suggestion is that a conformational change of helix H5 (known also as helix D) forces conformational changes in the macrocycle of Chl a 614 is implicated in the \xce\x94A535 absorbance change and quenching during photoprotective qE. The specific features (some of them similar to those of heme domain of globins) of the b3 domain account for these traits. The model predicts that antenna proteins having b3 pigments (i.e. LHCII, CP29, CP26) can act as potential quenchers. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which general anesthetics, including xenon and nitrous oxide, act are only beginning to be discovered. However, structural approaches revealed weak but specific protein-gas interactions.METHODS: To improve knowledge, we performed x-ray crystallography studies under xenon and nitrous oxide pressure in a series of 10 binding sites within four proteins.RESULTS: Whatever the pressure, we show (1) hydrophobicity of the gas binding sites has a screening effect on xenon and nitrous oxide binding, with a threshold value of 83% beyond which and below which xenon and nitrous oxide, respectively, binds to their sites preferentially compared to each other; (2) xenon and nitrous oxide occupancies are significantly correlated respectively to the product and the ratio of hydrophobicity by volume, indicating that hydrophobicity and volume are binding parameters that complement and oppose each other's effects; and (3) the ratio of occupancy of xenon to nitrous oxide is significantly correlated to hydrophobicity of their binding sites.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that xenon and nitrous oxide obey different binding mechanisms, a finding that argues against all unitary hypotheses of narcosis and anesthesia, and indicate that the Meyer-Overton rule of a high correlation between anesthetic potency and solubility in lipids of general anesthetics is often overinterpreted. This study provides evidence that the mechanisms of gas binding to proteins and therefore of general anesthesia should be considered as the result of a fully reversible interaction between a drug ligand and a receptor as this occurs in classical pharmacology. labels: #Globins"
b'Subterranean mammals spend their lives in dark, unventilated environments that are rich in carbon dioxide and ammonia and low in oxygen. Many of these animals are also long-lived and exhibit reduced aging-associated diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. We sequenced the genome of the Damaraland mole rat (DMR, Fukomys damarensis) and improved the genome assembly of the naked mole rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber). Comparative genome analyses, along with the transcriptomes of related subterranean rodents, revealed candidate molecular adaptations for subterranean life and longevity, including a divergent insulin peptide, expression of oxygen-carrying globins in the brain, prevention of high CO2-induced pain perception, and enhanced ammonia detoxification. Juxtaposition of the genomes of DMR and other more conventional animals with the genome of NMR revealed several truly exceptional NMR features: unusual thermogenesis, an aberrant melatonin system, pain insensitivity, and unique processing of 28S rRNA. Together, these genomes and transcriptomes extend our understanding of subterranean adaptations, stress resistance, and longevity. labels: #Globins'
b'The nitrite adducts of globins can potentially bind via O- or N- linkage to the heme iron. We have used EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) and DFT (density functional theory) to explore these binding modes to myoglobin and hemoglobin. We demonstrate that the nitrite adducts of both globins have detectable EPR signals; we provide an explanation for the difficulty in detecting these EPR features, based on uniaxial state considerations. The EPR and DFT data show that both nitrite linkage isomers can be present at the same time and that the two isomers are readily interconvertible in solution. The millisecond-scale process of nitrite reduction by Hb is investigated in search of the elusive Fe(II)-nitrite adduct. labels: #Globins'
b'Recent evidence from humans and rats indicates that nitrite is a vasodilator under hypoxic conditions by reacting with metal-containing proteins to produce nitric oxide (NO). We tested the hypothesis that near-physiological concentrations of nitrite would produce vasodilation in a hypoxia- and concentration-dependent manner in the hind limb of sheep. Anesthetized sheep were instrumented to measure arterial blood pressure and femoral blood flows continuously in both hind limbs. Nitrite was infused into one femoral artery to raise the nitrite concentration in the femoral vein by 10 to 15-fold while the sheep breathed 50%, 14% or 12% oxygen in inspired air. In contrast to reports in humans and rats, the nitrite infusion had no measurable effect on mean femoral blood flows or vascular conductances, regardless of inspired O2 levels. In vitro experiments showed no significant difference in the release of NO from nitrite in sheep and human red blood cells. Further experiments demonstrated nitrite is converted to NO in rat artery homogenates faster than sheep arteries, and that this source of NO production is attenuated in the presence of a heme oxidizer. Finally, western blots indicate that concentrations of the heme-containing protein cytoglobin, but not myoglobin, are markedly lower in sheep arteries compared with rats. Overall, the results demonstrate that nitrite is not a physiological vasodilator in sheep. This is likely due to a lack of conversion of nitrite to NO within the vascular smooth muscle, perhaps due to deficient amounts of the heme-containing protein cytoglobin. labels: #Globins'
b'Agnathans (jawless vertebrates) occupy a key phylogenetic position for illuminating the evolution of vertebrate anatomy and physiology. Evaluation of the agnathan globin gene repertoire can thus aid efforts to reconstruct the origin and evolution of the globin genes of vertebrates, a superfamily that includes the well-known model proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the genome of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) which revealed 23 intact globin genes and two hemoglobin pseudogenes. Analyses of the genome of the Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum) identified 18 full length and five partial globin gene sequences. The majority of the globin genes in both lamprey species correspond to the known agnathan hemoglobins. Both genomes harbor two copies of globin X, an ancient globin gene that has a broad phylogenetic distribution in the animal kingdom. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for an ortholog of neuroglobin in the lamprey genomes. Expression and phylogenetic analyses identified an ortholog of cytoglobin in the lampreys; in fact, our results indicate that cytoglobin is the only orthologous vertebrate-specific globin that has been retained in both gnathostomes and agnathans. Notably, we also found two globins that are highly expressed in the heart of P. marinus, thus representing functional myoglobins. Both genes have orthologs in L. camtschaticum. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that these heart-expressed globins are not orthologous to the myoglobins of jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata), but originated independently within the agnathans. The agnathan myoglobin and hemoglobin proteins form a monophyletic group to the exclusion of functionally analogous myoglobins and hemoglobins of gnathostomes, indicating that specialized respiratory proteins for O2 transport in the blood and O2 storage in the striated muscles evolved independently in both lineages. This dual convergence of O2-transport and O2-storage proteins in agnathans and gnathostomes involved the convergent co-option of different precursor proteins in the ancestral globin repertoire of vertebrates. labels: #Globins'
b'Inherited haemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic diseases, with millions of carriers and patients worldwide. At present, we know several hundred disease-causing mutations on the globin gene clusters, in addition to numerous clinically important trans-acting disease modifiers encoded elsewhere and a multitude of polymorphisms with relevance for advanced diagnostic approaches. Moreover, new disease-linked variations are discovered every year that are not included in traditional and often functionally limited locus-specific databases. This paper presents IthaGenes, a new interactive database of haemoglobin variations, which stores information about genes and variations affecting haemoglobin disorders. In addition, IthaGenes organises phenotype, relevant publications and external links, while embedding the NCBI Sequence Viewer for graphical representation of each variation. Finally, IthaGenes is integrated with the companion tool IthaMaps for the display of corresponding epidemiological data on distribution maps. IthaGenes is incorporated in the ITHANET community portal and is free and publicly available at http://www.ithanet.eu/db/ithagenes. labels: #Globins'
b'Cyanobacterial bloom, a common phenomenon nowadays often results in the depletion of dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) and releases microcystin-RR (MC-RR) in the water. Information on the combined effects of MC-RR and hypoxia on the goldfish is lacking, therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating the effect of two doses of MC-RR on the antioxidants and globin mRNA of goldfish under normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation. The result showed that MC-RR at both doses (50 and 200 \xce\xbcg kg(-1) body weight) significantly (p<0.05) induced superoxide dismutase activities in the liver and kidney but catalase activities and total antioxidant capacity were low in these organs during hypoxia and reoxygenation compared to normoxia and control. Myoglobin and neuroglobin mRNAs in MC-RR group were significantly induced in the brain only and are believed to protect the brain from oxidative damage. However, other organs were unprotected and extensive damage was observed in the liver cells. Our results clearly demonstrated that MC-RR and hypoxia-reoxygenation transitions were synergistically harmful to the goldfish and could impair its adaptation to hypoxia, especially during reoxygenation. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVES: Neuroglobin (Ngb), an identified globin in vertebrate brain, is a potential novel protective protein against brain ischemia. In our previous study, the human immunodeficiency virus trans-activator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain successfully delivered exogenous Ngb into neurons in the mouse, and protected the brain from cerebral ischemia-induced apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TAT-Ngb in attenuating oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced apoptosis and to explore the possible mechanism.METHODS: Nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced PC12 cells were divided into (1) the control group, (2) the OGD group (just OGD), (3) the Ngb treatment group (OGD and Ngb treatment), and (4) the TAT-Ngb treatment group (OGD and TAT-Ngb treatment). Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by the MTT assay and the AnnexinV/propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured by JC-1 staining. Caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, Stat3, Jak2, and Akt were determined by western blot analysis.RESULTS: Trans-activator of transcription effectively delivered Ngb into NGF-induced PC12 cells. Neuroglobin-mediated neuroprotection rescued cultured cells from OGD. We also confirmed previous findings that TAT-Ngb inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis following OGD. Inhibition of apoptosis by Ac-DEVD-CHO showed that caspase-3 was a crucial factor in OGD-induced apoptosis cascades. AG490, a specific Jak2 inhibitor, attenuated the protective effects of TAT-Ngb. The TAT-Ngb promoted expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 through the Jak2/Stat3 signal pathway, and inhibited apoptosis by blocking caspase-3 activation, while the Jak-Akt-Stat3 signal network was not involved.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that TAT-Ngb can protect neuron-like cells against OGD-induced apoptosis by activating the Jak2/Stat3 pathway. labels: #Globins'
b'The Amoebozoa represent a clade of unicellular amoeboid organisms that display a wide variety of lifestyles, including free-living and parasitic species. For example, the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has the ability to aggregate into a multicellular fruiting body upon starvation, while the pathogenic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite of humans. Globins are small heme proteins that are present in almost all extant organisms. Although several genomes of amoebozoan species have been sequenced, little is known about the phyletic distribution of globin genes within this phylum. Only two flavohemoglobins (FHbs) of D. discoideum have been reported and characterized previously while the genomes of Entamoeba species are apparently devoid of globin genes. We investigated eleven amoebozoan species for the presence of globin genes by genomic and phylogenetic in silico analyses. Additional FHb genes were identified in the genomes of four social amoebas and the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Moreover, a single-domain globin (SDFgb) of Hartmannella vermiformis, as well as two truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) of Acanthamoeba castellanii were identified. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these globin genes were independently acquired via horizontal gene transfer from some ancestral bacteria. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree of amoebozoan FHbs indicates that they do not share a common ancestry and that a transfer of FHbs from bacteria to amoeba occurred multiple times. labels: #Globins'
b'A protein in the globin-like fold contains six alpha-helices, A, B, E, F, G and H. Among them, the E-to-H helix unit (E, F, G and H helices) forms a compact structure. In this study, we searched similar structures to the E-to-H helix of leghomoglobin in the whole protein structure space using the Dali program. Several similar structures were found in other helical folds, such as KaiA/RbsU domain and Type III secretion system domain. These observations suggest that the E-to-H helix unit may be a common subunit in the whole protein 3D structure space. In addition, the common conserved hydrophobic residues were found among the similar structures to the E-to-H helix unit. Hydrophobic interactions between the conserved residues may stabilize the 3D structures of the unit. We also predicted the possible compact regions of the units using the average distance method. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inducible effect of hemin on exogenous neuroglobin (Ngb) in focal cerebral hypoxic-ischemia in rats.METHODS: 125 healthy SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham-operation control group, operation group, hemin treatment group, exogenous Ngb treatment group, and hemin and exogenous Ngb joint treatment group. Twenty-four hours after focal cerebral hypoxic-ischemia, Ngb expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blot analyses, while the brain water content and infarct volume were examined.RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blot analyses showed more pronounced Ngb expression in the hemin and exogenous Ngb joint operation group than in the hemin or exogenous Ngb individual treatment groups, thus producing significant differences in brain water content and infarct volume (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Hemin may be beneficial in protecting against focal cerebral hypoxic-ischemia through inducing the expression of exogenous Ngb. labels: #Globins'
b'Globin family was famous for oxygen supply function of its members such as hemoglobin and myoglobin. With the progress of research, several members of this protein family have been proven to play roles in tumors including glioma. Androglobin (ADGB) is a recently identified member of globin family with very few studies about its function. In the present study, we show that ADGB plays an oncogene role in glioma. Lentiviral vector mediated ADGB knockdown inhibited the proliferation of glioma cell lines determined by MTT assay and colony formation assay. ADGB knockdown also increased the apoptosis of glioma cell line U251 assessed by flow cytometry. In addition, western blot showed that ADGB knockdown altered levels of several proteins related to proliferation, survival or apoptosis in U251 cells. These findings suggest ADGB is involved in the progression of glioma in vitro. labels: #Globins'
b'The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus normally lives as a soil saprophyte. Its environment includes poorly oxygenated substrates that also occur during tissue invasive growth of the fungus in the human host. Up to now, few cellular factors have been identified that allow the fungus to efficiently adapt its energy metabolism to hypoxia. Here, we cultivated A. fumigatus in an O2 -controlled fermenter and analysed its responses to O2 limitation on a minute timescale. Transcriptome sequencing revealed several genes displaying a rapid and highly dynamic regulation. One of these genes was analysed in detail and found to encode fungoglobin, a previously uncharacterized member of the sensor globin protein family widely conserved in filamentous fungi. Besides low O2 , iron limitation also induced transcription, but regulation was not entirely dependent on the two major transcription factors involved in adaptation to iron starvation and hypoxia, HapX and SrbA respectively. The protein was identified as a functional haemoglobin, as binding of this cofactor was detected for the recombinant protein. Gene deletion in A. fumigatus confirmed that haem-binding fungoglobins are important for growth in microaerobic environments with O2 levels far lower than in hypoxic human tissue. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a member of the globin family involved in neuroprotection; it is primarily expressed in the brain and retina of vertebrates. Neuroglobin belongs to the heterogeneous group of hexacoordinate globins that have evolved in animals, plants and bacteria, endowed with the capability of reversible intramolecular coordination, allowing the binding of small gaseous ligands (O2, NO and CO). In a unique fashion among haemoproteins, ligand-binding events in neuroglobin are dependent on the sliding of the haem itself within a preformed internal cavity, as revealed by the crystal structure of its CO-bound derivative. Point mutants of the neuroglobin internal cavity have been engineered and their functional and structural characterization shows that hindering the haem displacement leads to a decrease in CO affinity, whereas reducing the cavity volume without interfering with haem sliding has negligible functional effects. labels: #Globins'
b'For sequences that are highly divergent, there is often insufficient information to infer accurate alignments, and phylogenetic uncertainty may be high. One way to address this issue is to make use of protein structural information, since structures generally diverge more slowly than sequences. In this work, we extend a recently developed stochastic model of pairwise structural evolution to multiple structures on a tree, analytically integrating over ancestral structures to permit efficient likelihood computations under the resulting joint sequence-structure model. We observe that the inclusion of structural information significantly reduces alignment and topology uncertainty, and reduces the number of topology and alignment errors in cases where the true trees and alignments are known. In some cases, the inclusion of structure results in changes to the consensus topology, indicating that structure may contain additional information beyond that which can be obtained from sequences. We use the model to investigate the order of divergence of cytoglobins, myoglobins, and hemoglobins and observe a stabilization of phylogenetic inference: although a sequence-based inference assigns significant posterior probability to several different topologies, the structural model strongly favors one of these over the others and is more robust to the choice of data set. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is the third member of the vertebrate globin family, and the structure was solved as a typical globin fold with a b-type heme. Although it has been proposed that Ngb could be involved in neuroprotection against oxidative stress, the protective mechanism has not been fully identified yet. In order to clarify functions under hypoxic condition, in this study, we focused on the scavenger activity of human Ngb (hNgb) against superoxide. The activity of hNgb for superoxide was evaluated to be 7.4\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M for IC50, the half maximal inhibitory concentration. The result indicates that hNgb can be an anti-oxidant, and the value was almost the same as that of ascorbic acid. In addition, we characterized oxidation states of a heme iron in superoxide-treated hNgb with spectroscopic measurements. Superoxide-treated hNgb in the ferric form was readily converted to the oxygenated ferrous form, and the result suggested that ferric hNgb could scavenge superoxide by change of an oxidation state in a heme iron. Moreover, mutational experiments were performed, and the each variant mutated at 46 and 55 positions suggested a disulfide bond between Cys46 and Cys55 could be essential to be sensors for oxidative stress with the direct binding of superoxide. As a consequence, we concluded that redox changes of the heme iron and the disulfide bond could regulate neuroprotective functions of hNgb, and it suggests that hNgb can afford protection against hypoxic and ischemic stress in the brain. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) promotes neuron survival under hypoxic/ischemic conditions. In vivo and in vitro assays provide evidence for redox-regulated functioning of Ngb. On the basis of X-ray crystal structures and our MD simulations, a mechanism for redox control of human Ngb (hNgb) activity via the influence of the CD loop on the active site is proposed. We provide evidence that the CD loop undergoes a strand-to-helix transition when the external environment becomes sufficiently oxidizing, and that this CD loop conformational transition causes critical restructuring of the active site. We postulate that the strand-to-helix mechanics of the CD loop allows hNgb to utilize the lability of Cys46/Cys55 disulfide bonding and of the Tyr44/His64/heme propionate interaction network for redox-controlled functioning of hNgb. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a globin present in the brain and retina of mammals. This hexacoordinated hemoprotein binds small diatomic molecules, albeit with lower affinity compared with other globins. We report here the resonance assignment of murine met-Neuroglobine, free and in complex with cyanide. labels: #Globins'
b'Within the globin superfamily, protoglobins (Pgb) belong phylogenetically to the same cluster of two-domain globin-coupled sensors and single-domain sensor globins. Multiple functional roles have been postulated for Methanosarcina acetivorans Pgb (Ma-Pgb), since the detoxification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species might co-exist with enzymatic activity(ies) to facilitate the conversion of CO to methane. Here, the nitrite-reductase and peroxynitrite isomerization activities of the CysE20Ser mutant of Ma-Pgb (Ma-Pgb*) are reported and analyzed in parallel with those of related heme-proteins. Kinetics of nitrite-reductase activity of ferrous Ma-Pgb* (Ma-Pgb*-Fe(II)) is biphasic and values of the second-order rate constant for the reduction of NO2- to NO and the concomitant formation of nitrosylated Ma-Pgb*-Fe(II) (Ma-Pgb*-Fe(II)-NO) are k(app1)=\xe2\x80\x8a9.6 \xc2\xb1 0.2 M(-1) s(-1) and k(app2) = 1.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1 M(-1) s(-1) (at pH 7.4 and 20 \xc2\xb0C). The k(app1) and k(app2) values increase by about one order of magnitude for each pH unit decrease, between pH 8.3 and 6.2, indicating that the reaction requires one proton. On the other hand, kinetics of peroxynitrite isomerization catalyzed by ferric Ma-Pgb* (Ma-Pgb*-Fe(III)) is monophasic and values of the second order rate constant for peroxynitrite isomerization by Ma-Pgb*-Fe(III) and of the first order rate constant for the spontaneous conversion of peroxynitrite to nitrate are h(app)\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a3.8 \xc3\x97 10(4 )M(-1) s(-1) and h0 = 2.8 \xc3\x97 10(-1) s(-1) (at pH 7.4 and 20 \xc2\xb0C). The pH-dependence of hon and h0 values reflects the acid-base equilibrium of peroxynitrite (pKa = 6.7 and 6.9, respectively; at 20 \xc2\xb0C), indicating that HOONO is the species that reacts preferentially with the heme-Fe(III) atom. These results highlight the potential role of Pgbs in the biosynthesis and scavenging of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. labels: #Globins'
b'Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Gfi1b-null embryos die at midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to adulthood. Both the embryonic deletion of Gfi1b by EpoR-Cre and the deletion in adult mice by Mx-Cre or Cre-ERT leads to reduced numbers of erythroid precursors, perturbed and delayed erythroid maturation, anemia and extramedullary erythropoiesis. Global expression analyses showed that the Hba-x, Hbb-bh1 and Hbb-y embryonic globin genes were upregulated in Gfi1b deficient TER119+ fetal liver cells over the gestation period from day 12.5-17.5 p.c. and an increased level of Hbb-bh1 and Hbb-y embryonic globin gene expression was even maintained in adult Gfi1b deficient mice. While the expression of Bcl11a, a regulator of embryonic globin expression was not affected by Gfi1b deficiency, the expression of Gata1 was reduced and the expression of Sox6, also involved in globin switch, was almost entirely lost when Gfi1b was absent. These findings establish Gfi1b as a regulator of embryonic globin expression and embryonic and adult erythroid maturation. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) plays a role in regulating vasodilation in response to changes in local oxygen concentration by altering the rate of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. Because the reduction of Cygb(Fe(3+)) by a reductant is the control step for Cygb-mediated NO metabolism, we examined the effects of temperature, pH, and heme ligands on the Cygb(Fe(3+)) reduction by ascorbate (Asc) under anaerobic conditions. The standard enthalpy of Cygb(Fe(3+)) reduction by Asc was determined to be 42.4 \xc2\xb1 3.1 kJ/mol. The rate of Cygb(Fe(3+)) reduction increased ~6% per \xc2\xb0C when temperature varied from 35\xc2\xb0C to 40\xc2\xb0C. The yield and the rate of Cygb(Fe(3+)) reduction significantly increases with pH (2-3 times per pH unit), paralleling the formation of the Asc ion (A(2-)) and the increased stability of reduced state of heme iron at high pH values. Heme ligand cyanide (CN(-)) decreased the yield and the rate of Cygb(Fe(3+)) reduction, but ligands CO and NO allowed the process of Cygb(Fe(3+)) reduction to continue to completion. Critical information is provided for modeling and prediction of the process of Cygb-mediated NO metabolism in vessels in a range of temperature and pH values. labels: #Globins'
b'Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data reveal large differences between the ferric ((13)C-)cyanide complexes of wild-type human neuroglobin (NGB) and its H64Q and F28L point mutants and the cyanide complexes of mammalian myo- and haemoglobin. The point mutations, which involve residues comprising the distal haem pocket in NGB, induce smaller, but still significant changes, related to changes in the stabilization of the cyanide ligand. Furthermore, for the first time, the full (13)C hyperfine tensor of the cyanide carbon of cyanide-ligated horse heart myoglobin (hhMb) was determined using Davies ENDOR (electron nuclear double resonance). Disagreement of these experimental data with earlier predictions based on (13)C NMR data and a theoretical model reveal significant flaws in the model assumptions. The same ENDOR procedure allowed also partial determination of the corresponding (13)C hyperfine tensor of cyanide-ligated NGB and H64QNGB. These (13)C parameters differ significantly from those of cyanide-ligated hhMb and challenge our current theoretical understanding of how the haem environment influences the magnetic parameters obtained by EPR and NMR in cyanide-ligated haem proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'Proteins are biosynthesized from N to C terminus before they depart from the ribosome and reach their bioactive state in the cell. At present, very little is known about the evolution of conformation and the free energy of the nascent protein with chain elongation. These parameters critically affect the extent of folding during ribosome-assisted biosynthesis. Here, we address the impact of vectorial amino acid addition on the burial of nonpolar surface area and on the free energy of native-like structure formation in the absence of the ribosomal machinery. We focus on computational predictions on proteins bearing the globin fold, which is known to encompass the 3/3, 2/2, and archaeal subclasses. We find that the burial of nonpolar surface increases progressively with chain elongation, leading to native-like conformations upon addition of the last C-terminal residues, corresponding to incorporation of the last two helices. Additionally, the predicted folding entropy for generating native-like structures becomes less unfavorable at nearly complete chain lengths, suggesting a link between the late burial of nonpolar surface and water release. Finally, the predicted folding free energy takes a progressive favorable dip toward more negative values, as the chain gets longer. These results suggest that thermodynamic stabilization of the native structure of newly synthesized globins during translation in the cell is significantly enhanced as the chain elongates. This is especially true upon departure of the last C-terminal residues from the ribosomal tunnel, which hosts ca., 30-40 amino acids. Hence, we propose that release from the ribosome is a crucial step in the life of single-domain proteins in the cell. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (NGB), a protein highly expressed in the retina, has been shown to be up-regulated to protect neurons from hypoxic and ischemic injuries. It exhibits neuroprotective functions and plays an important role in the survival of neurons. Recent studies show that light-emitting diode (LED) white light emitted significant amounts of blue light (short-wavelength), which may be harmful to retinal cells, but the studies about biomarkers for evaluating the damage from LED white light are still insufficient. In our study, we found that NGB levels in the retina showed a twofold increase and peaked at 1h after a 1-h exposure to blue light (453 nm) which did not cause damage to the retina. However, retinal damage was observed after 2h of blue-light irradiation, which induced an approximate sevenfold increase of NGB levels as confirmed by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis. Immunofluorescence study demonstrated that NGB was predominantly up-regulated in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), plexiform layer (PL) and photoreceptor layer (PRL). We also examined Ngb mRNA and protein expression in the damaged retina induced by light of other wavelengths given equal photon fluxes. The LED red light (625 nm), green light (527 nm) and blue light (453 nm) increased the expression of NGB and caused TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells, especially in the blue-light group. In addition, a negative correlation between NGB and rhodopsin was observed. These findings suggested that there was a correlation between NGB expression and the severity of the retinal damage, indicating NGB's potential function as a biological marker of retinal damage induced by LED light. labels: #Globins"
b'Loss of cytoglobin is found to be involved in the progression of several human cancers. However, its expression pattern and biological roles in human ovarian cancers are not clear. In this study, we examined cytoglobin expression in 118 archived ovarian cancer specimens using immunohistochemistry. A total of 72 specimens (61.0 %) showed cytoglobin downregulation. cytoglobin downregulation positively correlated with advanced FIGO stage and tumor grade. Cytoglobin plasmid transfection was performed in SKOV3 cell line and siRNA knockdown was carried out in SW626 cell line. MTT, colony formation assay and matrigel invasion assay were carried out to assess the role of cytoglobin on cell proliferation and invasion. Cytoglobin overexpression inhibited cell growth, invasion, cell cycle progression and cyclin D1 expression in SKOV3 cell line and its depletion promoted cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle transition and cyclin D1 expression. In conclusion, cytoglobin is downregulated in ovarian cancers and associated with advanced stage. Our data provides evidence that cytoglobin regulates the ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion. labels: #Globins'
b'CONTEXT: Acute inhalation of combustion smoke adversely affects brain homeostasis and energy metabolism. We previously showed that overexpressed neuroglobin (Ngb), neuron specific globin protein, attenuates the formation of smoke inhalation-induced oxidative DNA damage, in vivo, in the mouse brain, while others reported protection by Ngb in diverse models of brain injury, mainly involving oxidative stress and hypoxic/ischemic insults.OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent elevated Ngb ameliorates post smoke-inhalation brain bioenergetics and homeostasis in Ngb overexpressing transgenic mouse.METHODS: Smoke inhalation induced changes in bioenergetics were measured in the wild type and Ngb transgene mouse brain. Modulations of mitochondrial respiration were analyzed using the Seahorse XF24 flux analyzer and changes in cytoplasmic energy metabolism were assessed by measuring enzymatic activities and lactate in the course of post smoke recovery.RESULTS: Cortical mitochondria from Ngb transgene, better maintained ATP synthesis-linked oxygen consumption and unlike wild type mitochondria did not increase futile oxygen consumption feeding the proton leak, reflecting lesser smoke-induced mitochondrial compromise. Measurements revealed lesser reduction of mitochondrial ATP content and lesser compensatory increases in cytosolic energy metabolism, involving pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities as well as cytosolic lactate levels. Additionally, induction of c-Fos, the early response gene and key neuronal stress sensor, was attenuated in Ngb transgene compared to wild type brain after smoke.CONCLUSION: Considered together, these differences reflect lesser perturbations produced by acute inhalation of combustion smoke in the Ngb overexpressing mouse, suggesting that Ngb mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity and raises the threshold of smoke inhalation-induced brain injury. labels: #Globins'
b"The tissue distribution and function of hemoglobin or myoglobin are well known; however, a newly found cytoglobin (CYGB), which also belongs to the globin family, remains to be characterized. To assess its expression in human malignancies, we sought to screen a number of cell lines originated from many tissues using northern blotting and real time PCR techniques. Unexpectedly, we found that several, but not all, melanoma cell lines expressed CYGB mRNA and protein at much higher levels than cells of other origins. Melanocytes, the primary origin of melanoma, also expressed CYGB at a high level. To verify these observations, immunostaining and immunoblotting using anti-CYGB antibody were also performed. Bisulfite-modified genomic sequencing revealed that several melanoma cell lines that abrogated CYGB expression were found to be epigenetically regulated by hypermethylation in the promoter region of CYGB gene. The RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the CYGB transcript in CYGB expression-positive melanoma cell lines resulted in increased proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometric analysis using 2'-, 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), an indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS), revealed that the cellular ROS level may be involved in the proliferative effect of CYGB. Thus, CYGB appears to play a tumor suppressive role as a ROS regulator, and its epigenetic silencing, as observed in CYGB expression-negative melanoma cell lines, might function as an alternative pathway in the melanocyte-to-melanoma transition. labels: #Globins"
b'Globin gene regulation occurs in the context of a maturing erythroid cell, which is undergoing significant changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. There are few model systems available that facilitate studies of globin gene regulation in the context of erythroid maturation. Extensively self-renewing erythroblasts (ESREs) are a nontransformed model of erythroid maturation derived from murine fetal liver or yolk sac. Imaging flow cytometry and RNA-seq studies demonstrate that ESREs functionally and molecularly model erythroid maturation. To address the need for a model system that also recapitulates human globin switching, ESREs were derived from mice transgenic for the complete human \xce\xb2-globin locus (\xce\xb2-yac ESREs). \xce\xb2-yac ESREs express \xce\xb2-globin from the transgenic human locus, with minimal \xce\xb3-globin expression. When treated with hydroxyurea or inhibitors to histone deacetylases, DNA methyltransferases, or the histone demethylase lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), \xce\xb2-Yac ESREs significantly increase their \xce\xb3-globin expression, demonstrating their utility for studying agents that influence maturational globin switching. \xce\xb2-yac ESREs were further used to characterize the secondary effects of LSD1 inhibition on erythroid maturation, with inhibition of LSD1 resulting in altered cell and nuclear size, prolonged Kit expression, and decreased rates of enucleation consistent with impaired maturation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that \xce\xb2-yac ESREs have significant utility for identifying modulators of maturational globin switching as well as for studying the broader role of those modulators in erythroid maturation. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin plays an important function in the supply of oxygen in nervous tissues. In human neuroglobin, a cysteine at position 46 in the loop connecting the C and D helices of the globin fold is presumed to form an intramolecular disulfide bond with Cys55. Rupture of this disulfide bridge stabilizes bi-histidyl haem hexacoordination, causing an overall decrease in the affinity for oxygen. Here, the first X-ray structure of wild-type human neuroglobin is reported at 1.74\xe2\x80\x85\xc3\x85 resolution. This structure provides a direct observation of two distinct conformations of the CD region containing the intramolecular disulfide link and highlights internal cavities that could be involved in ligand migration and/or are necessary to enable the conformational transition between the low and high oxygen-affinity states following S-S bond formation. labels: #Globins'
b'A laboratory-made INSTCoated fused-silica capillary has been newly used for CE separation of four mixtures of proteins in sodium phosphate BGEs at pH 3.0 and 2.5, respectively. The obtained separation efficiencies range from 145,000 theoretical plates per meter for myoglobin to 1,216,000 m(-1) for lysozyme. A total of 49-89% of the number of theoretical plates was obtained in a commercial polyvinyl alcohol coated capillary compared to the INSTCoated capillary under the same experimental conditions, 0-86% was obtained in a laboratory polyacrylamide-coated capillary, and only 0-6% was obtained in an uncoated fused-silica capillary. The RSD values for the intraday repeatability for an INSTCoated capillary were 0.1-1.0% (migration time) and 0.3-2.4% (peak area); RSD values for the interday repeatability in the same capillary are 0.6-1.4% (migration time) and 2.4-5.5% (peak area); RSD values for interday repeatability between different capillaries equaled 1.7-2.1% (migration time) and 2.8-10.9% (peak area). The INSTCoated capillary has been further used for rapid determination of globin chains isolated from red blood cells. A separation of \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 chains prepared from adult blood has been completed in 3 min with a peak resolution of 1.3, and the separation of \xce\xb1 and (G)\xce\xb3 chains prepared from newborn blood took 3 min with a peak resolution of 3.6. labels: #Globins'
b'The current study was performed to evaluate the mechanisms and therapeutic effects of overexpressing neuroglobin (Ngb) on spinal cord injury (SCI). Adeno-associated virus (AAV) was injected in the T12 section 7 days before SCI. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: a sham group, a vehicle group, an AAV-EGFP group and an AAV-Ngb group. Recovery of hind limb locomotor function was determined during the 3-week post operation period by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale. At 24 h after SCI and at the end of the study, the segments of spinal cord, centered with the lesion site were harvested for histopathological analysis. Immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to recognize neuN in the lesion sections. At 24 h after SCI, the spinal cord tissue samples were removed to analyze tissue concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Apoptotic cells were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit. The expression of bcl-2, bax, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3, were determined by Western blot assay and immunostaining analysis. The results showed that animals overexpressing Ngb had significantly greater recovery of locomotor function, less neuronal loss and fewer apoptotic cells. In addition, overexpressing Ngb significantly increased bcl-2 expression and SOD level, decreased bax expression, attenuated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol fraction, and reduced the activity of caspase-3 and MDA level after SCI. These findings suggest, that overexpressing Ngb can significantly improve the recovery of locomotor function. This neuroprotective effect may be associated with the inhibition of neural apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. labels: #Globins'
b'There is a significant need for novel treatments that will improve traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes. One potential neuroprotective mechanism is to increase oxygen binding proteins such as neuroglobin. Neuroglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, is an effective free radical scavenger, and is neuroprotective within the brain following hypoxia and ischemia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuroglobin overexpression improves sensorimotor outcomes following TBI in transgenic neuroglobin overexpressing (NGB) mice. Additional study aims were to determine if and when an endogenous neuroglobin response occurred following TBI in wild-type (WT) mice, and in what brain regions and cell types the response occurred. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) was performed in adult (5 month) C57/BL6 WT mice, and NGB mice constitutively overexpressing neuroglobin via the chicken beta actin promoter coupled with the cytomegalovirus distal enhancer. The gridwalk task was used for sensorimotor testing of both WT and NGB mice, prior to injury, and at 2, 3, and 7 days post-TBI. NGB mice displayed significant reductions in the average number of foot faults per minute walking at 2, 3, and 7 days post-TBI when compared to WT mice at each time point. Neuroglobin mRNA expression was assessed in the injured cortex of WT mice prior to injury, and at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-TBI using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Neuroglobin mRNA was significantly increased at 7 days post-TBI. Immunostaining showed neuroglobin primarily localized to neurons and glial cells in the injured cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus of WT mice, while neuroglobin was present in all brain regions of NGB mice at 7 days post-TBI. These results showed that overexpression of neuroglobin reduced sensorimotor deficits following TBI, and that an endogenous increase in neuroglobin expression occurs during the subacute period. Increasing neuroglobin expression through novel therapeutic interventions during the acute period after TBI may improve recovery. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cgb) was discovered a decade ago and is a fourth member of the group of hexacoordinated globin-folded proteins. Although some crystal structures have been reported and several functions have been proposed for Cgb, its physiological role remains uncertain. In this study, we measured cyanide binding to the ferric state of the wild-type (WT) Cgb, and found that the binding consisted of multiple steps. These results indicated that Cgb may be comprised of several forms, and the presence of monomers, dimers, and tetramers was subsequently confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Remarkably, each species contained two distinguishable forms, and, in the monomer, analyses of alternative cysteine states suggested the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond (monomer SS form) and a structure with unpaired thiol groups (monomer SH form). These confirmed that forms were separated by gel-exclusion chromatography, and that the cyanide binding of the separated fractions was again measured; they showed different affinities for cyanide, with the monomer fraction showing the highest affinity. In addition, the ferrous state in each fraction showed distinct carbon monoxide (CO)-binding properties, and the affinities for cyanide and CO suggested a linear correlation. Furthermore, we also prepared several variants involving the two cysteine residues. The C38S and C83S variants showed a binding affinity for cyanide similar to the value for the monomer SH form, and hence the fraction with the highest affinity for exogenous ligands was designated as a monomer SS form. We concluded that polymerization could be a mechanism that triggers the exertion of various physiological functions of this protein and that an appropriate disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues was critical for regulating the binding affinity of Cgb, which can act as a ROS scavenger, for exogenous ligands. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (NGB) is considered as an endogenous neuroprotective molecule against stroke, since the protein alleviates the adverse effects of hypoxic and ischemic insults. We previously demonstrated the functional link between NGB and mitochondria since it is required for respiratory chain function. Thus, here, we evaluated the relevance of this effect in the Harlequin (Hq) mouse strain, which exhibits retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic atrophy due to a respiratory chain complex I (CI) defect. A twofold decrease of NGB amounts was observed in Hq retinas. We constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus which combines to the mouse NGB open reading frame, its 5' and 3'UTR, for guarantying mRNA stability and translation capacity. The vector was administrated intravitreally to Hq mice and NGB expression was stable for up to 7 months without negative effect on retinal architecture or function. On the contrary, RGCs and their axons were substantially preserved from degeneration; consequently, CI activity in optic nerves was protected conferring improvements in vision. Hence, we established that NGB prevents respiratory chain impairment, therefore, protecting visual function otherwise compromised by mitochondrial energetic failure. labels: #Globins"
b'It has recently been shown that aqueous solutions of tetrapropylammonium chloride and sulphate salts destabilize the folded conformation of Trp-peptides (Dempsey et al., 2011). This result is rationalized by the application of a statistical thermodynamic approach (Graziano, 2010). It is shown that the magnitude of the solvent-excluded volume effect, the main contribution for the native state stability, decreases in both aqueous 2 M TPACl solution and aqueous 1 M TPA2SO4 solution. This happens because TPA(+) ions are so large in size and interact so weakly with water molecules, due to their very low charge density, to be able to counteract the electrostrictive effect of chloride and sulphate ions on the water structure, so that the density of their aqueous solutions is smaller or only slightly larger than that of water. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: The molecular profile of circulating blood can reflect physiological and pathological events occurring in other tissues and organs of the body and delivers a comprehensive view of the status of the immune system. Blood has been useful in studying the pathobiology of many diseases. It is accessible and easily collected making it ideally suited to the development of diagnostic biomarker tests. The blood transcriptome has a high complement of globin RNA that could potentially saturate next-generation sequencing platforms, masking lower abundance transcripts. Methods to deplete globin mRNA are available, but their effect has not been comprehensively studied in peripheral whole blood RNA-Seq data. In this study we aimed to assess technical variability associated with globin depletion in addition to assessing general technical variability in RNA-Seq from whole blood derived samples.RESULTS: We compared technical and biological replicates having undergone globin depletion or not and found that the experimental globin depletion protocol employed removed approximately 80% of globin transcripts, improved the correlation of technical replicates, allowed for reliable detection of thousands of additional transcripts and generally increased transcript abundance measures. Differential expression analysis revealed thousands of genes significantly up-regulated as a result of globin depletion. In addition, globin depletion resulted in the down-regulation of genes involved in both iron and zinc metal ion bonding.CONCLUSIONS: Globin depletion appears to meaningfully improve the quality of peripheral whole blood RNA-Seq data, and may improve our ability to detect true biological variation. Some concerns remain, however. Key amongst them the significant reduction in RNA yields following globin depletion. More generally, our investigation of technical and biological variation with and without globin depletion finds that high-throughput sequencing by RNA-Seq is highly reproducible within a large dynamic range of detection and provides an accurate estimation of RNA concentration in peripheral whole blood. High-throughput sequencing is thus a promising technology for whole blood transcriptomics and biomarker discovery. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is the most fatal cancer in the developed world due to presence of metastases at time of diagnosis. The aim of this study is to examine DNA hypermethylation in sputum compared to sputum cytology for the diagnosis of lung cancer. A novel risk analysis is introduced, using the distinction between diagnostic and risk markers.METHODS: Two independent sets were randomly composed from a prospectively collected sputum bank (Set 1: n = 98 lung cancer patients, n = 90 controls; Set 2: n = 60 lung cancer patients, n = 445 controls). Sputum cytology was performed for all samples. The following DNA hypermethylation markers were tested in both sets: RASSF1A, APC and cytoglobin (CYGB). Two statistical analyses were conducted: multivariate logistic regression and a risk classification model based on post-test probabilities.RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, RASSF1A was the best of the three markers in discriminating lung cancer cases from controls in both sets (sensitivity 41-52%, specificity 94-96%). The risk model showed that 36% of lung cancer patients were defined as "high risk" (\xe2\x89\xa5 60% chance on lung cancer) based on RASSF1A hypermethylation in Set 1. The model was reproducible in Set 2. Risk markers (APC, CYGB) have less diagnostic value. Sensitivity of cytology for lung cancer diagnosis was 22%. RASSF1A hypermethylation yielded a sensitivity of 45%. The combined sensitivity for RASSF1A with cytological diagnosis increased to 52% with similar specificity (94%).CONCLUSION: In a diagnostic setting, hypermethylation analysis in sputum is possible when a diagnostic marker is used. However, risk markers are insufficient for this purpose. labels: #Globins'
b'On a global scale, the frequencies and magnitudes of hypoxic events in coastal and estuarine waters have increased dramatically over the past 20 years. Fish populations are suitable indicators for the assessment of the quality of aquatic ecosystems, as they are omnipresent and often comprise a variety of different lifestyles and adaption strategies. We have investigated on the molecular level the impact of hypoxia on two fish species typical of European estuaries. We monitored the expression of eleven putatively hypoxia-responsive genes by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR in brains, gills and hearts of the ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) and the flounder (Platichthys flesus). We first investigated the effect of naturally occurring hypoxia in the Elbe estuary. In a second approach, expression changes in the response to hypoxia were monitored under controlled laboratory conditions. The genes that showed the strongest effect were two respiratory proteins, myoglobin and neuroglobin, as well as the apoptosis enzyme caspase 3. As previously observed in other fish, myoglobin, which was considered to be muscle-specific, was found in brain and gills as well. Comparison of field and laboratory studies showed that--with the exception of the heart of flounder--that mRNA levels of the selected genes were about the same, suggesting that laboratory conditions reflect natural conditions. Likewise, trends of gene expression changes under hypoxia were the same, although hypoxia response was more pronounced in the Elbe estuary. In general, the flounder displayed a stronger response to hypoxia than the ruffe, suggesting that the flounder is more susceptible to hypoxia. The most pronounced differences were found among tissues within a species, demonstrating that hypoxia response is largely tissue-specific. In summary, our data suggest that laboratory experiments essentially mimic field data, but additional environmental factors enhance hypoxia response in nature. labels: #Globins'
b'The bimolecular rate constants for the globin- and alkali-catalysed hydrolysis of substituted phenyl hexanoates in the absence and presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) obey Br\xc3\xb8nsted equations with \xce\xb2(lg)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89-0.53 (globin-catalysed), -0.68 (globin-catalysed in CTAB), -0.34 (in water) and -0.74 (in CTAB), respectively. The slopes indicate that the microsolvation environments associated with the transition states of the catalysed reactions are different from those that occur in aqueous medium. The slope (-0.74) for the reaction in CTAB implies that it proceeds in a less polar medium. The larger \xce\xb2(lg) value (-0.53) obtained for the globin-catalysed reaction compared to that for the uncatalysed one may be attributed to either the less polar microenvironments of the transition states or the involvement of one of the imidazole groups as a nucleophile. The results from a study of the effect of pH on the reactivity provide evidence for the latter assumption. All of the ligands were docked into the hydrophobic pocket of the protein, and the resulting docking scores ranged from -30.76 to -23.61 kcal mol\xe2\x81\xbb\xc2\xb9. Molecular dynamic simulations and MM-PBSA/GBSA calculations performed for the complexes gave insight into the binding modes of globin to the esters, which are consistent with experimental results. The calculations yielded comparable free energies of binding to the experimental ones for 4-nitrophenyl and 4-chloro-2-nitrophenyl hexanoates. In conclusion, information obtained from the linear free-energy relationship is still very useful for elucidating the mechanisms of organic reactions, including enzyme-catalysed reactions. This approach is further supported by the utilization of computational tools. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a neuron-specific hexacoordinated globin capable of binding various ligands, including O2, NO, and CO, the biological function of which is still uncertain. Various studies seem to indicate that neuroglobin is a neuroprotective agent when overexpressed, acting as a potent inhibitor of oxidative and nitrosative stress. In this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological response of the neuroglobin gene and protein expression in the cerebral tissue of rats sustaining traumatic brain injury of differing severity, while simultaneously measuring the oxidant/antioxidant balance. Two levels of trauma (mild and severe) were induced in anesthetized animals using the weight-drop model of diffuse axonal injury. Rats were then sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h after traumatic brain injury, and the gene and protein expression of neuroglobin and the concentrations of malondialdehyde (as a parameter representative of reactive oxygen species-mediated damage), nitrite + nitrate (indicative of NO metabolism), ascorbate, and glutathione (GSH) were determined in the brain tissue. Results indicated that mild traumatic brain injury, although causing a reversible increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress (increase in malondialdehyde and nitrite + nitrate) and an imbalance in antioxidants (decrease in ascorbate and GSH), did not induce any change in neuroglobin. Conversely, severe traumatic brain injury caused an over nine- and a fivefold increase in neuroglobin gene and protein expression, respectively, as well as a remarkable increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress and depletion of antioxidants. The results of this study, showing a lack of effect in mild traumatic brain injury as well as asynchronous time course changes in neuroglobin expression, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and antioxidants in severe traumatic brain injury, do not seem to support the role of neuroglobin as an endogenous neuroprotective antioxidant agent, at least under pathophysiological conditions. labels: #Globins'
b'Oxidative metabolism and redox signaling prove to play a decisional role in controlling adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) biology. However, HSPCs reside in a hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment raising the question of how oxygen metabolism might be ensued. In this study, we provide for the first time novel functional and molecular evidences that human HSPCs express myoglobin (Mb) at level comparable with that of a muscle-derived cell line. Optical spectroscopy and oxymetry enabled to estimate an O2-sensitive heme-containing protein content of approximately 180 ng globin per 10(6) HSPC and a P50 of approximately 3 \xc2\xb5M O2. Noticeably, expression of Mb mainly occurs through a HIF-1-induced alternative transcript (Mb-V/Mb-N\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8935\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8915, p<.01). A search for other Mb-related globins unveiled significant expression of neuroglobin (Ngb) but not of cytoglobin. Confocal microscopy immune detection of Mb in HSPCs strikingly revealed nuclear localization in cell subsets expressing high level of CD34 (nuclear/cytoplasmic Mb ratios 1.40\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.02 vs. 0.85\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.05, p<.01) whereas Ngb was homogeneously distributed in all the HSPC population. Dual-color fluorescence flow cytometry indicated that while the Mb content was homogeneously distributed in all the HSPC subsets that of Ngb was twofold higher in more immature HSPC. Moreover, we show that HSPCs exhibit a hypoxic nitrite reductase activity releasing NO consistent with described noncanonical functions of globins. Our finding extends the notion that Mb and Ngb can be expressed in nonmuscle and non-neural contexts, respectively, and is suggestive of a differential role of Mb in HSPC in controlling oxidative metabolism at different stages of commitment. labels: #Globins'
b'Recently we have described the globin-coupled heme containing adenylate cyclase from Leishmania major (HemAC-Lm) that shows an O2 dependent cAMP signaling (Sen Santara, et. al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 16790-16795 (2013)). The heme iron of HemAC-Lm is expected to participate in oxygen binding and activates adenylate cyclase activity during catalysis, but its interactions with O2 are uncharacterized. We have utilized the HemAC-Lm and stopped-flow methods to study the formation and decay of the HemAC-Lm oxygenated complex at 25\xc2\xb0C. Mixing of the ferrous HemAC-Lm with air-saturated buffer generates a very stable oxygenated complex with absorption maxima at 414, 540 and 576nm. The distal axial ligand in the deoxygenated ferrous HemAC-Lm is displaced by O2 at a rate of ~10s(-1). To prepare apoprotein of heme iron in HemAC-Lm, we have mutated the proximal His161 to Ala and characterized the mutant protein. The apo as well as heme reconstituted ferric state of the mutant protein shows a ~30 fold lower catalytic activity compared to oxygenated form of wild type protein. The oxygenated form of heme reconstituted mutant protein is highly unstable (decay rate=6.1s(-1)). Decomposition of the oxygenated intermediate is independent of O2 concentration and is monophasic. Thus, the stabilization of ferrous-oxy species is an essential requirement in the wild type HemAC-Lm for a conformational alteration in the sensor domain that, sequentially, activates the adenylate cyclase domain, resulting in the synthesis of cAMP. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a brain globin with neuroprotective effects against ischemia and related pathological processes, acting as O2 sensor and antiapoptotic pathway transducer. Here, we survey data on neuroanatomical coexpression of transcription factors, epigenetic signature and predictive transcription factor binding sites at the neuroglobin gene locus to find hints of pathways to neuroglobin transcriptional regulation. These data provide a glimpse of how neuroglobin expression may translate into neuronal diversity and function, as well as disease. labels: #Globins'
b'Mammalian neuroglobin (Ngb) protects neuronal cells under conditions of oxidative stress. We previously showed that human Ngb acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for the \xce\xb1-subunits of heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins and inhibits reductions in cAMP concentration, leading to protection against cell death. In the present study, we created human E60Q Ngb mutant and clarified that Glu60 of human Ngb is a crucial residue for its GDI and neuroprotective activities. Moreover, we investigated structural and functional properties of several human Ngb mutants and demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of human Ngb is due to its GDI activity and not due to its scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species. labels: #Globins'
b'Mammalian skeletal muscle can remodel, repair, and regenerate itself by mobilizing satellite cells, a resident population of myogenic progenitor cells. Muscle injury and subsequent activation of myogenic progenitor cells is associated with oxidative stress. Cytoglobin is a hemoprotein expressed in response to oxidative stress in a variety of tissues, including striated muscle. In this study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is up-regulated in activated myogenic progenitor cells, where it localizes to the nucleus and contributes to cell viability. siRNA-mediated depletion of cytoglobin from C2C12 myoblasts increased levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death both at baseline and in response to stress stimuli. Conversely, overexpression of cytoglobin reduced reactive oxygen species levels, caspase activity, and cell death. Mice in which cytoglobin was knocked out specifically in skeletal muscle were generated to examine the role of cytoglobin in vivo. Myogenic progenitor cells isolated from these mice were severely deficient in their ability to form myotubes as compared with myogenic progenitor cells from wild-type littermates. Consistent with this finding, the capacity for muscle regeneration was severely impaired in mice deficient for skeletal-muscle cytoglobin. Collectively, these data demonstrate that cytoglobin serves an important role in muscle repair and regeneration. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (NGB) is a neuron-specific vertebrate globin shown to protect against hypoxia, ischemia, oxidative stress and the toxic effects of Amyloid-beta. Following on our and others' results highlighting the importance of NGB expression in disease, we searched for genetic determinants of its expression. We found that a microRNA expressed with the NGB transcript shows significant target enrichments in the angiogenesis pathway and the Alzheimer disease/presenilin pathway. Using reporter constructs we identified potential promoter/enhancer elements between the transcription start site and 1,142\xc2\xa0bp upstream. Using 184 post-mortem temporal lobe samples we replicated the reported negative effect of age, and after genotyping tagging SNPs we found one (rs981471) showing a significant correlation with the gene's expression and another (rs8014408) showing an interaction with age, the rare C allele being correlated with higher expression and faster decline. The two SNPs are towards the 3' end of NGB within the same LD block, 52\xc2\xa0Kb apart and modestly correlated (r (2)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.5). Next generation sequencing of the same 184 temporal lobe samples and 79 confirmed AD patients across the entire gene region (including>12\xc2\xa0Kb on the 3' and 5' flank) revealed limited coding variation, suggesting purifying selection of NGB, but did not identify regulatory or disease associated rare variants. A dinucleotide repeat in intron 1 with extensive evidence of functionality showed interesting but inconclusive results, as it was not amenable to further molecular analysis. labels: #Globins"
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effects of hypoxia preconditioning (HPC) and its effects on serum neuroglobin (NGB) and S-100B level in the patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm surgery.METHODS: Forty patients scheduled to intracranial aneurysm surgery were randomly.divided into 2 groups: HPC group (n= 20) and control group (n= 20). The patients in HPC group were treated with 3 cycles of deoxidation-reoxygenation after intubation. The time of deoxidation in each HPC cycle was recorded, while vital signs were also recorded in each corresponding time point. Blood samples were obtained from exsanguinate radial artery and jugular bulb section at the end of each HPC cycle and corresponding time points during operation to measure serum level of NGB and S100B protein and to analysis blood gas.RESULTS: During HPC process, the patients in group HPC experienced mild hypoxia and CO2 retention. With the times of HPC increasing, CO2 retention degree became heavier (P<0. 05) while hypoxia improved, the patients need more time to make SpO2 from 100% to 90% (P<0. 05). From T2 to T4 (the end of the third reoxygenation, during skull opened and aneurysm dipped, skull closed), NGB in group HPC was higher than that in control (P<0. 05), but S-100B level was not different between HPC and control group (P>0. 05).CONCLUSION: HPC could induce compensatory ability of the body to hypoxia, which might be related to the up-regulation of NGB expression. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (CYGB) is ubiquitously expressed in the cytoplasm of fibroblastic cells in many organs, including hepatic stellate cells. As yet, there is no specific marker with which to distinguish stellate cells from myofibroblasts in the human liver. To investigate whether CYGB can be utilized to distinguish hepatic stellate cells from myofibroblasts in normal and fibrotic human liver, human liver tissues damaged by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and at different stages of fibrosis were obtained by liver biopsy. Immunohistochemistry was performed on histological sections of liver tissues using antibodies against CYGB, cellular retinol-binding protein-1 (CRBP-1), \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin (\xce\xb1-SMA), thymocyte differentiation antigen 1 (Thy-1), and fibulin-2 (FBLN2). CYGB- and CRBP-1-positive cells were counted around fibrotic portal tracts in histological sections of the samples. The expression of several of the proteins listed above was examined in cultured mouse stellate cells. Quiescent stellate cells, but not portal myofibroblasts, expressed both CYGB and CRBP-1 in normal livers. In fibrotic and cirrhotic livers, stellate cells expressed both CYGB and \xce\xb1-SMA, whereas myofibroblasts around the portal vein expressed \xce\xb1-SMA, Thy-1, and FBLN2, but not CYGB. Development of the fibrotic stage was positively correlated with increases in Sirius red-stained, \xce\xb1-SMA-positive, and Thy-1-positive areas, whereas the number of CYGB- and CRBP-1-positive cells decreased with fibrosis development. Primary cultured mouse stellate cells expressed cytoplasmic CYGB at day 1, whereas they began to express \xce\xb1-SMA at the cellular margins at day 4. Thy-1 was undetectable throughout the culture period. In human liver tissues, quiescent stellate cells are CYGB positive. When activated, they also become \xce\xb1-SMA positive; however, they are negative for Thy-1 and FBLN2. Thus, CYGB is a useful marker with which to distinguish stellate cells from portal myofibroblasts in the damaged human liver. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin\xc2\xa0(Ngb) is a member of the globin superfamily expressed mainly in the nervous system and\xc2\xa0retina of vertebrates.\xc2\xa0Accumulated evidence has clearly demonstrated that\xc2\xa0Ngb has a neuro-protective role enhancing cell viability under hypoxia and other types of oxidative stress. It was suggested that oxidant\xc2\xa0stress\xc2\xa0could play an important role in neuronal injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).\xc2\xa0The present study aims to examine the expression of Ngb in the temporal cortex and its cellular localization after SAH. We used a prechiasmatic cistern model of SAH. Ngb expression was examined at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72\xc2\xa0h after SAH by western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction\xc2\xa0(PCR). Immunohistochemistry and\xc2\xa0immunofluorescence were performed to detect the localization of Ngb. Real-time PCR demonstrated that Ngb mRNA levels increased from 3\xc2\xa0h after SAH, peaked at 6\xc2\xa0h. Western blot showed Ngb protein levels were significantly increased in SAH groups in the temporal cortex and reached the peak at 24\xc2\xa0h after SAH. The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that Ngb was weakly expressed in the cortex in the control group while the enhanced expression of Ngb could be detected in the SAH groups. In addition,\xc2\xa0immunofluorescence\xc2\xa0results revealed that the over-expressed Ngb was located in the neuronal and microglia cell cytoplasm. These findings indicated that Ngb might play an important neuro-protective effect after SAH. labels: #Globins'
b'Apoptosis represents the key mechanism for the removal of surplus, damaged, or aged cells, and deregulated apoptosis has been implicated in the etiology of diverse pathologies. There are two main pathways which are known to initiate apoptosis: the death receptor-dependent (extrinsic) pathway and the mitochondrial-dependent (intrinsic) pathway. In the intrinsic pathway, as a response to diverse signals from the cellular environment, a permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane occurs, followed by the release of cytochrome c and the activation of the effector caspases, which leads to cell death. Recently, increased attention has been paid to the possible role of the protein neuroglobin, in the regulation of the apoptotic process, and data have been provided, demonstrating the ability of the protein to inhibit the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by interacting with mitochondrial proteins. The molecular details of these interactions, however, remain largely undefined. In the present study, well recognized bioinformatics methods were applied to predict the possible interaction interfaces which the protein can exploit to interact with relevant proteins of the mitochondrial-dependent pathway of apoptosis. In the search for therapeutic approaches based on the modulation of apoptosis, such a computational prediction could represent a first, guiding step, for the design of strategies aimed at modulating these interactions, and tune the apoptotic process. labels: #Globins'
b'Animals in many aquatic ecosystems must cope with changing environmental parameters, such as temperature, oxygen availability or pH. We have investigated the molecular responses to acidification in the gills and body of zebrafish (Danio rerio) by means of quantitative real-time PCR. Expression levels of typical stress genes and genes for antioxidant defense were strongly enhanced in gills, and to lesser extents in the body, suggesting that acidification leads to oxidative stress. Surprisingly, the globins were found to be among the most prominent stress-responsive proteins in our study. Myoglobin showed the strongest response of all investigated genes in the gills, as confirmed by Western blotting. These findings agree with the role of globins in oxidative energy metabolism, but may also hint at a specific function in antioxidative defense. labels: #Globins'
b'Semi-fossorial ground squirrels face challenges to respiratory gas transport associated with the chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia of underground burrows, and such challenges are compounded in species that are native to high altitude. During hibernation, such species must also contend with vicissitudes of blood gas concentrations and plasma pH caused by episodic breathing. Here, we report an analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) function in six species of marmotine ground squirrels with different altitudinal distributions. Regardless of their native altitude, all species have high Hb-O2 affinities, mainly due to suppressed sensitivities to allosteric effectors [2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and chloride ions]. This suppressed anion sensitivity is surprising given that all canonical anion-binding sites are conserved. Two sciurid species, the golden-mantled and thirteen-lined ground squirrel, have Hb-O2 affinities that are characterized by high pH sensitivity and low thermal sensitivity relative to the Hbs of humans and other mammals. The pronounced Bohr effect is surprising in light of highly unusual amino acid substitutions at the C-termini that are known to abolish the Bohr effect in human HbA. Taken together, the high O2 affinity of sciurid Hbs suggests an enhanced capacity for pulmonary O2 loading under hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, while the large Bohr effect should help to ensure efficient O2 unloading in tissue capillaries. In spite of the relatively low thermal sensitivities of the sciurid Hbs, our results indicate that the effect of hypothermia on Hb oxygenation is the main factor contributing to the increased blood-O2 affinity in hibernating ground squirrels. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of neuroglobin in the pathology of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and ascertain if neuroglobin has any protective effects against sepsis-associated encephalopathy.DESIGN: Randomized laboratory animal study.SETTING: Research university animal laboratory.SUBJECTS: Two hundred and forty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.INTERVENTIONS: Rats received cecal puncture and ligation (or sham) surgery to induce sepsis, then broken up into groups based on whether or not the rat developed sepsis-associated encephalopathy as determined by electroencephalograph and evoked potential recordings. The rats were then left untreated to examine the effect of sepsis-associated encephalopathy on neuroglobin, treated with a neuroglobin antisense nucleotide to block gene expression, or given hemin, a neuroglobin inducer.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Following sepsis induction, diagnosis, and treatment, the brains were analyzed for both gross and ultrastructural morphology. Also, neuronal neuroglobin immunoreactivity and apoptosis (via terminal uridine nucleotide end-labeling) were examined. Blood serum levels were then analyzed for neuroglobin, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde levels. We determined that sepsis-associated encephalopathy induces damage evident when examining both gross and ultrastructural morphology, as well as induces neuronal neuroglobin expression. Also, blockade of neuroglobin expression via antisense treatment will exacerbate these pathological effects, while increasing neuroglobin levels via hemin will ameliorate them. Blood analysis found that levels of superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde mirrored the level of pathology found in the brain, while plasma neuroglobin levels reflected the amount of neuronal neuroglobin immunoreactivity.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that neuroglobin is involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and has neuroprotective effects. We also determined that hemin has protective effects against sepsis-associated encephalopathy as well, most probably due to its effect on neuroglobin. labels: #Globins'
b"The physiological functions of neuroglobin (Ngb), the heme protein of the globin family expressed in the nervous tissue, have not yet been clarified. Besides O2 storage and homeostasis, Ngb is thought to play a role in neuroprotection as a scavenger of toxic reactive species generated in vivo under conditions of oxidative stress. Herein, the interaction of Ngb with the quinones generated by oxidation of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine) and catechol estrogens (2-hydroxyestradiol and 4-hydroxyestradiol), which have been implicated in neurodegenerative pathologies like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, has been investigated. The cytotoxicity of quinones has been ascribed to the derivatization of amino acid residues (mainly cysteine) in proteins through the formation of covalent bonds with the aromatic rings. Combined studies of tandem mass spectrometry and protein unfolding indicate the presence of quinone-promoted modifications in all of the Ngb derivatives analyzed (i.e., obtained employing either catecholamines or catechol estrogens as the source of the reactive species). Among protein residues, the highest reactivity of cysteines (Cys46, Cys55, and Cys120 in human Ngb) toward quinone species has been confirmed, and the dependence of the extent of protein modification on the method employed for catechol oxidation has been observed. When the oxidation reaction proceeds by one-electron steps, the involvement of semiquinone reactivity has been observed. The whole analysis of the data of Ngb modification suggests that the catecholamine-oxidation products can extensively modify proteins (likely by catecholamine oligomers, the compounds initially formed during the transformation of catecholamine to melanin). The modification mediated by catechol estrogens is less pronounced but strongly affects the interactions with the solvent as well as the protein stability. labels: #Globins"
b'BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major cause of death and severe disability, but effective treatments are limited. Neuroglobin, a neuronal heme-globin, has been advocated as a novel pharmacological target in combating stroke and neurodegenerative disorders based on cytoprotective properties. Using thoroughly validated antibodies and oligos, we give a detailed brain anatomical characterization of transgenic mice over expressing Neuroglobin. Moreover, using permanent middle artery occlusion the effect of elevated levels of Neuroglobin on ischemic damage was studied. Lastly, the impact of mouse strain genetic background on ischemic damage was investigated.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A four to five fold increase in Neuroglobin mRNA and protein expression was seen in the brain of transgenic mice. A \xce\xb2-actin promoter was used to drive Neuroglobin over expression, but immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization showed over expression to be confined to primarily the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and only in neurons. The level and expression pattern of endogenous Neuroglobin was unaffected by insertion of the over expressing Ngb transgene. Neuroglobin over expression resulted in a significant reduction in infarct volume 24 hours after ischemia. Immunohistochemistry showed no selective sparing of Neuroglobin expressing cells in the ischemic core or penumbra. A significant difference in infarct volume was found between mice of the same strain, but from different colonies.SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to some previous reports, Neuroglobin over expression is not global but confined to a few well-defined brain regions, and only in neurons. This study confirms previous reports showing a correlation between reduced infarct volume and elevated Neuroglobin levels, but underlines the need to study the likely contribution from compensatory mechanisms to the phenotype following a genetic perturbation. We also stress, that care should be taken when comparing results where different mouse strains and colonies have been used due to large genetic background contribution to the observed phenotype. labels: #Globins'
b'The oxy-cobolglobin models of the general formula (Py)Co(Por)(O2) (Por = meso-tetraphenyl- and meso-tetra-p-tolylporphyrinato dianions) were constructed by sequential low-temperature interaction of Py and dioxygen with microporous layers of Co-porphyrins. At cryogenic temperatures small increments of NO were introduced into the cryostat and the following reactions were monitored by the FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopy during slow warming. Similar to the recently studied (NH3)Co(Por)(O2) system (Kurtikyan et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 13671-13680), this interaction leads to the nitric oxide dioxygenation reaction with the formation of thermally unstable nitrato complexes (Py)Co(Por)(\xce\xb7(1)-ONO2). The reaction proceeds through the formation of the six-coordinate peroxynitrite adducts (Py)Co(Por)(OONO), as was demonstrated by FTIR measurements with the use of isotopically labeled (18)O2, (15)NO, N(18)O, and (15)N(18)O species and DFT calculations. In contrast to the ammonia system, however, the binding of dioxygen in (Py)Co(Por)(O2) is weaker and the second reaction pathway takes place due to autoxidation of NO by rebound O2 that in NO excess gives N2O3 and N2O4 species adsorbed in the layer. This leads eventually to partial formation of (Py)Co(Por)(NO) and (Py)Co(Por)(NO2) as a result of NO and NO2 reactions with five-coordinate Co(Por)(Py) complexes that are present in the layer after the O2 has been released. The former is thermally unstable and at room temperature passes to the five-coordinate nitrosyl complex, while the latter is a stable compound. In these experiments at 210 K, the layer consists mostly of six-coordinate nitrato complexes and some minor quantities of six-coordinate nitro and nitrosyl species. Their relative quantities depend on the experimental conditions, and the yield of nitrato species is proportional to the relative quantity of peroxynitrite intermediate. Using differently labeled nitrogen oxide isotopomers in different stages of the process the formation of the caged radical pair after homolytic disruption of the O-O bond in peroxynitrite moiety is clearly shown. The composition of the layers upon farther warming to room temperature depends on the experimental conditions. In vacuo the six-coordinate nitrato complexes decompose to give nitrate anion and oxidized cationic complex Co(III)(Por)(Py)2. In the presence of NO excess, however, the nitro-pyridine complexes (Py)Co(Por)(NO2) are predominantly formed formally indicating the oxo-transfer reactivity of (Py)Co(Por)(\xce\xb7(1)-ONO2) with regard to NO. Using differently labeled nitrogen in nitric oxide and coordinated nitrate a plausible mechanism of this reaction is suggested based on the isotope distribution in the nitro complexes formed. labels: #Globins'
b'Exposure to arsenic in drinking water results in a widespread environmental problem in the world, and the brain is a major target. Neuroglobin is a vertebrate heme protein regarded as playing neuroprotective role in hypoxia or oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) on primary cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and detected neuroglobin (Ngb) expression in rat CGNs exposed to NaAsO2. Our results show that apoptosis was obviously induced by NaAsO2 treatment in rat CGNs by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species generation increased significantly in the cells exposed to NaAsO2, and the apoptotic effects could be partially reversed by antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Ngb protein and mRNA expression were significantly downregulated in rat CGNs shortly after NaAsO2 exposure and then upregulated after a longer time of exposure. Furthermore, mRNA expression changed more than protein expression and the toxic effect of NaAsO2 on Ngb expression is dose dependent. Higher Ngb expression was also detected in rat cerebellum, but not in other parts (cerebrum, hippocampus, and midbrain) of the brain exposed to NaAsO2 for 16\xc2\xa0weeks. Taken together, cytotoxic effects of NaAsO2 on rat CGNs is induced at least partly by oxidative stress and Ngb may influence the course of arsenic toxicity in rat CGNs and rat cerebellum. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cgb) is a hexacoordinate globin that plays various physiological roles, including O2 transport, enzyme activity, and lipid peroxidation. The distal His(81)(E7) residue acts as the native sixth ligand and is crucial to exogenous ligand binding, distal environment adjustment, and heme pocket stabilization. The role of E7 has been widely studied in myoglobin, neuroglobin, and hemoglobin, but not in Cgb. In this work, the structural dynamic features of CO-ligated Cgb, CgbCO, as well as its three distal mutants H81QCgbCO, H81LCgbCO, and H81VCgbCO, were examined by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results revealed that distal mutation significantly affected the dynamic properties of the CD-D-E and EF loop regions of Cgb. Distinct fluctuations and the occurrence of new inner cavities reflected rearrangements of the heme pocket. Distal mutation was found to affect heme motion slightly, indicating a different heme motion mechanism than that for neuroglobin. Some key residues such as E7 and CD3 showed remarkable changes in their dynamics that contributed to heme pocket rearrangement and loop region fluctuations. MD studies of four CgbCO models indicated that the distal E7 residue was a crucial influence on the dynamics of CgbCO in terms of loop fluctuations, cavity rearrangement, and slight heme motion. labels: #Globins'
b"Despite the similar tertiary structure between cytoglobin (Cygb) and myoglobin, several structural features indicate a distinct mechanism of Cygb interactions with exogenous ligands. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of the dynamics and thermodynamics of structural changes associated with the exogenous ligand migration between the solvent and the heme active site in Cygb with reduced and oxidized Cys 38 and Cys 83 side-chains (Cygb(ox) and Cygb(red), respectively). Photo-acoustic and transient absorption data show that disulfide bond formation alters the ligand migration pathway(s) as evident from the distinct geminate quantum yields (\xce\xa6gem=0.35 for Cygb(ox) and \xce\xa6gem=0.63 for Cygb(red)) and rate constants for bimolecular CO rebinding. Moreover, ligand escape from the protein matrix is fast (<40ns) and coupled with an enthalpy change of 18\xc2\xb12kcalmol(-1) in Cygb(red), whereas the disulfide bridge formation promotes a biphasic ligand escape associated with an overall enthalpy change of 9\xc2\xb14kcalmol(-1). These results demonstrate that the disulfide bond connecting helix E and helix B modulates the conformational dynamics in Cygb including the size and energy barrier between the internal hydrophobic sites. Based on the comparison of the thermodynamic profiles for CO photo-dissociation from Cygb, myoglobin, and neuroglobin we propose that in Cygb(red) the photo-dissociated ligand escapes through the hydrophobic tunnel, whereas the CO preferably migrates through the His64 gate in Cygb(ox) suggesting that Cygb's physiological role may vary in response to intracellular redox conditions. labels: #Globins"
b'To explore the response of \xce\xb2 globin locus with established chromatin domains upon their exposure to new transcriptional environments, we transferred the chromatin-packaged \xce\xb2 globin locus of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or hESC-derived erythroblasts into an adult transcriptional environment. Distinct globin expression patterns were observed. In hESC-derived erythroblasts where both \xce\xb5 and \xce\xb3 globin were active and marked by similar chromatin modifications, \xce\xb5 globin was immediately silenced upon transfer, whereas \xce\xb3 globin continued to be expressed for months, implying that different transcriptional environments were required for their continuing expression. Whereas \xce\xb2 globin was silent both in hESCs and in hESC-derived erythroblasts, \xce\xb2 globin was only activated upon transfer from hESCs, but not in the presence of dominant \xce\xb3 globin transferred from hESC-derived erythroblasts, confirming the competing nature of \xce\xb3 versus \xce\xb2 globin expression. With time, however, silencing of \xce\xb3 globin occurred in the adult transcriptional environment with concurrent activation of \xce\xb2-globin, accompanied by a drastic change in the epigenetic landscape of \xce\xb3 and \xce\xb2 globin gene regions without apparent changes in the transcriptional environment. This switching process could be manipulated by overexpression or downregulation of certain transcription factors. Our studies provide important insights into the interplay between the transcription environment and existing chromatin domains, and we offer an experimental system to study the time-dependent human globin switching. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb), a recently discovered globin, is predominantly expressed in the brain, retina, and other nerve tissues of vertebrates. The unfolding processes of apo-neuroglobin (apoNgb) induced by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and urea were investigated by spectroscopic methods. In the unfolding processes, apoNgb's tertiary structural transition was monitored by the changes of intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra, and its secondary structural transition was measured by the changes of far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) spectra. In addition, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), a hydrophobic cluster binding dye, was also used to monitor the unfolding process of apoNgb and to explore its intermediates. Results showed that GdnHCl-induced unfolding of apoNgb was via a three-state pathway, that is, Native state (N) \xe2\x86\x92 Intermediate state (I) \xe2\x86\x92 Unfolded state (U), during which the intermediate was inferred by an increase in fluorescence intensity and the change of CD value. Gibbs free energy changes are 10.2 kJ \xc2\xb7 mol(-1) for the first unfolding transition and 14.0 kJ \xc2\xb7 mol(-1) for the second transition. However, urea-induced unfolding of apoNgb only underwent a two-state transition: Native state (N) \xe2\x86\x92 Partially unfolded state (P). The result showed that GdnHCl can efficiently affect the conformational states of apoNgb compared with those of urea. The work will benefit to have an understanding of the unfolding mechanism of apoNgb induced by GdnHCl and urea. labels: #Globins"
b'Equilibrium unfolding experiments provide access to protein thermodynamic stability revealing basic aspects of protein structure-function relationships. A limitation of these experiments stands on the availability of large amounts of protein samples. Here we present the use of the NanoDrop for monitoring guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding by Soret absorbance of monomeric heme proteins. Unfolding experiments using 2 \xce\xbcl of reactant are validated by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy and supported with five heme proteins including neuroglobin, cytochrome b5, and cyanoglobin. This work guarantees 2 orders of magnitude reduction in protein expense. Promising low-cost protein unfolding experiments following other chromophores and high-throughput screenings are discussed. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin, the third mammalian globin with a hexa-coordinated heme, exists predominantly in neurons of the brain. Neuroglobin plays an important role in neuronal death upon ischemia and oxidative stress. The physiological function of neuroglobin remains unclear. Here, we report a novel function of neuroglobin in neurite development. Knocking-down neuroglobin exhibited a prominent neurite-deficient phenotype in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. Silencing neuroglobin prevented neurite outgrowth, while ectopic expression of neuroglobin but not homologous cytoglobin promoted neurite outgrowth of N2a cells upon serum withdrawal. In primary cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons, neuroglobin was upregulated and preferentially distributed in neurites during neuronal development. Overexpression of neuroglobin but not cytoglobin in cultured cortical neurons promoted axonal outgrowth, while knocking-down of neuroglobin retarded axonal outgrowth. Neuroglobin overexpression suppressed phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) but increased Akt phosphorylation during neurite induction. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that neuroglobin and various mutants (E53Q, E118Q, K119N, H64A, H64L, and Y44D) bound with Akt and PTEN differentially. Neuroglobin E53Q showed a prominent reduced PTEN binding but increased Akt binding, resulting in decreased p-PTEN, increased p-Akt, and increased neurite length. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of neuroglobin in neuritogenesis or development via interacting with PTEN and Akt differentially to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, providing potential therapeutic applications of neuroglobin for axonopathy in neurological diseases. labels: #Globins'
b'The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of Neuroglobin (Ngb) and Cytoglobin (Cygb) in the solitary tract nucleus (STN) and in the carotid body of human subjects. Transverse serial sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brainstems, taken from six subjects, were investigated. Ngb and Cygb are expressed in both the structures. Differences in expression of Ngb and Cygb among dorsal and ventral area of the STN may be related to their different functions and different metabolic demands. Because the STN plays an important role in the processing of cardiovascular and respiratory reflex inputs, Ngb and Cygb may play an integrative central modulatory action for the two systems. labels: #Globins'
b'This work deals with two neuroglobins from phylogenetically distant organisms. Deriving from the acoelomorph Symsagittifera roscoffensis, SrNgb is functionally pentacoordinated, and is assumed to function as a reserve of dioxygen (O\xe2\x82\x82). Obtained from mice, mNgb is functionally hexacoordinated, and presumably triggers signals from sensing O\xe2\x82\x82. Here, it is investigated how these two globins are permeated by diatomic gases, SrNgb by O\xe2\x82\x82 and mNgb by CO. With protein atomic coordinates available from high-resolution X-ray diffraction analysis, O\xe2\x82\x82 and CO pathways were traced from molecular-dynamics simulations in H\xe2\x82\x82O solution, which makes no difference between the two gases, accelerated by applying an external randomly-oriented minimal force to the center of mass of the diatomic gas molecule. This allowed us to explore a statistically significant large number of trajectories. It emerged that CO leaves mNgb from preferentially peripheral gates located on the side of the heme propionate chains, whereas O\xe2\x82\x82 leaves SrNgb from the opposite side. This shows no analogy with either the functionally pentacoordinated, O\xe2\x82\x82-transporting, myoglobin (Mgb), or the hexacoordinated, O\xe2\x82\x82-sensing, cytoglobin, despite the same three-over-three typical \xce\xb1-helical globin folding. The sole analogy that could be observed was a preference for the shortest diatomic gas pathways with both SrNgb and Mgb. It is tempting to speculate that this fulfills the need of being quick in delivering O\xe2\x82\x82 to depleted organs. labels: #Globins'
b'Nuclear factor- (erythroid-derived 2) like 2 (NFE2L2, NRF2) is a key transcriptional activator of the antioxidant response pathway and is closely related to erythroid transcription factor NFE2. Under oxidative stress, NRF2 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds cis-acting enhancer sequences found near oxidative stress response genes. Using the dietary isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SFN) to activate NRF2, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified several hundred novel NRF2-mediated targets beyond its role in oxidative stress. Activated NRF2 bound the antioxidant response element (ARE) in promoters of several known and novel target genes involved in iron homeostasis and heme metabolism, including known targets FTL and FTH1, as well as novel binding in the globin locus control region. Five novel NRF2 target genes were chosen for followup: AMBP, ABCB6, FECH, HRG-1 (SLC48A1), and TBXAS1. SFN-induced gene expression in erythroid K562 and lymphoid cells were compared for each target gene. NRF2 silencing showed reduced expression in lymphoid, lung, and hepatic cells. Furthermore, stable knockdown of NRF2 negative regulator KEAP1 in K562 cells resulted in increased NQO1, AMBP, and TBXAS1 expression. NFE2 binding sites in K562 cells revealed similar binding profiles as lymphoid NRF2 sites in all potential NRF2 candidates supporting a role for NRF2 in heme metabolism and erythropoiesis. labels: #Globins'
b'The aim of the present study was to uncover the mechanism underlying the neuroprotection of Hemin\xe2\x80\x91mediated neuroglobin (Ngb) in an in vivo model of brain injury. Sixty healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=12, each group): sham surgery, ischemia, Hemin, LY294002 (LY) and Hemin + LY. Focal cerebral ischemia was established by unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological function and cerebral infarction volume were evaluated 24 h following surgery. Expression of Ngb and Akt mRNA was detected by RT\xe2\x80\x91PCR, and the expression of Ngb protein and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway were determined by western blot analysis. No visible damage in the brain and no neurological impairment in the sham surgery group were observed. When compared with the ischemia group, Hemin treatment induced the upregulation of Ngb and Akt mRNA, Ngb protein and phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt). Hemin treatment also improved neurological functions and reduced infarct volume. By contrast, LY treatment increased infarct volume, deteriorated neurological functions and significantly reduced expression of pAkt; however, Ngb mRNA and protein expression was unchanged. When compared with Hemin alone, a combination of Hemin and LY treatment induced more severe brain damage and markedly decreased the expression of pAkt. The results of the present study demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is associated with cell survival, mediates the neuroprotective effects of Hemin\xe2\x80\x91induced Ngb following cerebral ischemia. labels: #Globins'
b'Myoglobins are ubiquitous proteins that play a seminal role in oxygen storage, transport, and NO metabolism. The folding mechanism of apomyoglobins from different species has been studied to a fair extent over the last two decades. However, integrated investigations of the entire process, including both the early (sub-ms) and late (ms-s) folding stages, have been missing. Here, we study the folding kinetics of the single-Trp Escherichia coli globin apoHmpH via a combination of continuous-flow microfluidic and stopped-flow approaches. A rich series of molecular events emerges, spanning a very wide temporal range covering more than 7 orders of magnitude, from sub-microseconds to tens of seconds. Variations in fluorescence intensity and spectral shifts reveal that the protein region around Trp120 undergoes a fast collapse within the 8 \xce\xbcs mixing time and gradually reaches a native-like conformation with a half-life of 144 \xce\xbcs from refolding initiation. There are no further fluorescence changes beyond ca. 800 \xce\xbcs, and folding proceeds much more slowly, up to 20 s, with acquisition of the missing helicity (ca. 30%), long after consolidation of core compaction. The picture that emerges is a gradual acquisition of native structure on a free-energy landscape with few large barriers. Interestingly, the single tryptophan, which lies within the main folding core of globins, senses some local structural consolidation events after establishment of native-like core polarity (i.e., likely after core dedydration). In all, this work highlights how the main core of the globin fold is capable of becoming fully native efficiently, on the sub-millisecond time scale. labels: #Globins'
b'In China, the traditional Chinese medicine "YiSui ShenXu Granule" has been used for treating \xce\xb2-thalassemia over 20 years and known to be effective in clinic. Several purified components from "YiSui ShenXu Granule" are tested in K562 cells to reveal its effect on globin expression and erythroid differentiation, and one of the purified components, emodin, was demonstrated to increase the expression of \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb5-, \xce\xb3-globin, CD235a, and CD71 in K562 cells. Moreover, the increase of their expression is emodin concentration-dependent. The mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles are further analyzed and 417 mRNAs and 35 miRNAs with differential expression between untreated and emodin-treated K562 cells were identified. Among them, two mRNAs that encode known positive regulators of erythropoiesis, ALAS2, and c-KIT respectively, increased during emodin-induced K562 erythroid differentiation, meanwhile, two negative regulators, miR-221 and miR-222, decreased during this process. These results indicate that emodin can improve the expression of globin genes in K562 cells and also induce K562 cells to erythroid differentiation possibly through up-regulating ALAS2 and c-KIT and down-regulating miR-221 and miR-222. labels: #Globins'
b"Several factors involved in the core circadian rhythm are PAS domain proteins, one of which, neuronal PAS2 (NPAS2), contains a heme-binding motif. It is thought that heme controls the transcriptional activity of core circadian factors BMAL1-NPAS2, and that the heme-binding nuclear receptor REV-erb\xce\xb1 negatively regulates the expression of BMAL1. To examine the role of heme in the nucleus, we expressed nuclear hemeproteins including the nuclear localization signal-added cytoglobin, NPAS2 and REV-erb\xce\xb1. Then, the living cells expressing these proteins were treated with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). The fluorescent signal derived from DCFH-DA was observed in the nucleus. When the cells were cultured with hemin, the signal of heme in the nucleus increased. Considering that DCFH-DA reacted with heme, we propose that the use of DCFH-DA could be useful in detection of the heme moiety of hemeprotein in vivo. labels: #Globins"
b'Kr\xc3\xbcppel-like factors 3 and 8 (KLF3 and KLF8) are highly related transcriptional regulators that bind to similar sequences of DNA. We have previously shown that in erythroid cells there is a regulatory hierarchy within the KLF family, whereby KLF1 drives the expression of both the Klf3 and Klf8 genes and KLF3 in turn represses Klf8 expression. While the erythroid roles of KLF1 and KLF3 have been explored, the contribution of KLF8 to this regulatory network has been unknown. To investigate this, we have generated a mouse model with disrupted KLF8 expression. While these mice are viable, albeit with a reduced life span, mice lacking both KLF3 and KLF8 die at around embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), indicative of a genetic interaction between these two factors. In the fetal liver, Klf3 Klf8 double mutant embryos exhibit greater dysregulation of gene expression than either of the two single mutants. In particular, we observe derepression of embryonic, but not adult, globin expression. Taken together, these results suggest that KLF3 and KLF8 have overlapping roles in vivo and participate in the silencing of embryonic globin expression during development. labels: #Globins'
b'A patient with \xce\xb2(E)/\xce\xb2(0) -thalassemia major was converted to transfusion-independence 4.5 years ago by lentiviral gene transfer in hematopoietic stem cells while showing a myeloid-biased cell clone. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a potential alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells. If fetal to adult globin class, switching does not occur in vivo in iPSC-derived erythroid cells, \xce\xb2-globin gene transfer would be unnecessary. To investigate both vector integration skewing and the potential use of iPSCs for the treatment of thalassemia, we derived iPSCs from the thalassemia gene therapy patient and compared iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells to their natural isogenic somatic counterparts. In NSG immunodeficient mice, embryonic to fetal and a partial fetal to adult globin class switching were observed, indicating that the gene transfer is likely necessary for iPSC-based therapy of the \xce\xb2-hemoglobinopathies. Lentivector integration occurred in regions of low and high genotoxicity. Surprisingly, common integration sites (CIS) were identified across those iPSCs and cells retrieved from isogenic and nonisogenic gene therapy patients with \xce\xb2-thalassemia and adrenoleukodystrophy, respectively. This suggests that CIS observed in the absence of overt tumorigenesis result from nonrandom lentiviral integration rather than oncogenic in vivo selection. These findings bring the use of iPSCs closer to practicality and further clarify our interpretation of genome-wide lentivector integration. labels: #Globins'
b'The endogenous vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) is metabolized in tissues in an oxygen-dependent manner. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, high concentrations of myoglobin (Mb) function as a potent NO scavenger. However, the Mb concentration is very low in vascular smooth muscle, where low concentrations of cytoglobin (Cygb) may play a major role in metabolizing NO. Questions remain regarding how low concentrations of Cygb and Mb differ in terms of NO metabolism, and the basis for their different cellular roles and functions. In this study, electrode techniques were used to perform comparative measurements of the kinetics of NO consumption by Mb and Cygb. UV/Vis spectroscopic methods and computer simulations were performed to study the reaction of Mb and Cygb with ascorbate (Asc) and the underlying mechanism. It was observed that the initial rate of Cygb(3+) reduction by Asc was 415-fold greater than that of Mb(3+). In the low [O2] range (0-50 \xce\xbcM), the Cygb-mediated NO consumption rate is ~ 500 times more sensitive to changes in O2 concentration than that of Mb. The reduction of Cygb(3+) by Asc follows a reversible kinetic model, but that of Mb(3+) is irreversible. A reaction mechanism for Cygb(3+) reduction by Asc is proposed, and the reaction equilibrium constants are determined. Our results suggest that the rapid reduction of Cygb by cellular reductants enables Cygb to efficiently regulate NO metabolism in the vascular wall in an oxygen-dependent manner, but the slow rate of Mb reduction does not show this oxygen dependence. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Cytoglobin (Cygb) was discovered a decade ago as the fourth vertebrate heme-globin. The function of Cygb is still unknown, but accumulating evidence from in vitro studies point to a putative role in scavenging of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide metabolism and in vivo studies have shown Cygb to be up regulated by hypoxic stress. This study addresses three main questions related to Cygb expression in the hippocampus: 1) Is the rat hippocampus a valid neuroanatomical model for the human hippocampus; 2) What is the degree of co-expression of Cygb and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the rat hippocampus; 3) The effect of chronic restraint stress (CRS) on Cygb and nNOS expression.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to compare Cygb expression in the human and rat hippocampi as well as Cygb and nNOS co-expression in the rat hippocampus. Transcription and translation of Cygb and nNOS were investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR) and Western blotting on hippocampi from Flinders (FSL/FRL) rats exposed to CRS.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cygb expression pattern in the human and rat hippocampus was found to be similar. A high degree of Cygb and nNOS co-expression was observed in the rat hippocampus. The protein levels of nNOS and Cygb were significantly up-regulated in FSL animals in the dorsal hippocampus. In the ventral hippocampus Cygb protein levels were significantly up-regulated in the FSL compared to the FRL, following CRS.SIGNIFICANCE: The rodent hippocampus can be used to probe questions related to Cygb protein localization in human hippocampus. The high degree of Cygb and nNOS co-expression gives support for Cygb involvement in nitric oxide metabolism. CRS induced Cygb and nNOS expression indicating that Cygb expression is stress responsive. Cygb and nNOS may be important in physiological response to stress. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that cytoglobin (Cygb) may function as a tumor suppressor gene.METHODS: We immunohistochemically evaluated the expression of Cygb, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), phosphorylated (p)-Akt, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\xce\xb1 (TNF\xce\xb1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 88 patients with 41 high-grade gliomas and 47 low-grade gliomas. Intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) was also determined and associated with clinicopathological factors.RESULTS: Low expression of Cygb was significantly associated with the higher histological grading and tumor recurrence. A significant negative correlation emerged between Cygb expression and PI3K, p-Akt, IL-6, TNF\xce\xb1 or VEGF expression. Cygb expression was negatively correlated with IMD. There was a positive correlation between PI3K, p-Akt, IL-6, TNF\xce\xb1 and VEGF expression with IMD.High histologic grade, tumor recurrence, decreased Cygb expression, increased PI3K expression, increased p-Akt expression and increased VEGF expression correlated with patients' overall survival in univariate analysis. However, only histological grading and Cygb expression exhibited a relationship with survival of patients as independent prognostic factors of glioma by multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Cygb loss may contribute to tumor recurrence and a worse prognosis in gliomas. Cygb may serve as an independent predictive factor for prognosis of glioma patients. labels: #Globins"
b'OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the potentially protective effect of neuroglobin (Ngb) gene-modified bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rabbits.METHODS: A lentiviral vector containing an Ngb gene was constructed and used to deliver Ngb to BMSCs. Ngb gene-modified BMSCs were then injected at the SCI sites 24 hours after SCI. The motor functions of the rabbits were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan rating scale. Fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCRs, Western blots, malondialdehyde (MDA) tests, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling assays were also performed.RESULTS: Ngb expression in the Ngb-BMSC group increased significantly. A more significant functional improvement was observed in the Ngb-BMSC group compared with those in the other groups. Traumatic SCI seemingly led to an increase in MDA level and number of apoptotic cells, which can be prevented by Ngb-BMSC treatment.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Ngb gene-modified BMSCs can strengthen the therapeutic benefits of BMSCs in reducing secondary damage and improving the neurological outcome after traumatic SCI. Therefore, the combined strategy of BMSC transplantation and Ngb gene therapy can be used to treat traumatic SCI. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin is a neuronal protein with protective effects in animal models of stroke and Alzheimer's disease, but the relevance of these effects to Alzheimer's disease in humans is unknown. We measured neuroglobin levels by western blot and immunostained hippocampal sections for neuroglobin, cell-type protein markers, and amyloid-\xce\xb2, in brain tissue obtained at autopsy from patients with Alzheimer's disease. Neuroglobin levels were increased in early and moderately advanced Alzheimer's disease compared to controls, but declined to control levels in severe disease. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, neuroglobin was detected within neurons, as well as at extracellular sites associated with amyloid-\xce\xb2 deposits. We conclude that, as in transgenic mouse models, neuroglobin may influence the course of clinical Alzheimer's disease. labels: #Globins"
b'Neuroglobin is a hypoxia-inducible, neuroprotective protein related to myoglobin and hemoglobin, but little is known about its neurodevelopmental expression or function. To begin to explore these issues, we measured neuroglobin protein expression during neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells in vitro and in the neurogenic subventricular zone of adult rats in vivo. Neuroglobin protein expression was barely detectable by western blotting in human embryonic stem cells, but was readily demonstrable in neural stem cells, and was further induced upon differentiation to neurons. In the adult subventricular zone, neuroglobin expression coincided with that of the neuronal lineage marker doublecortin, but not with vimentin or glial fibrillary acidic protein. These findings suggest that neuroglobin is expressed early in the course of neuronal differentiation and may, therefore, have a role in neurodevelopment. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is an endogenous neuroprotective molecule against hypoxic/ischemic brain injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely undefined. Our recent study revealed that Ngb can bind to voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a regulator of mitochondria permeability transition (MPT). In this study we examined the role of Ngb in MPT pore (mPTP) opening following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunocytochemistry showed that the binding between Ngb and VDAC was increased after OGD compared to normoxia, indicating the OGD-enhanced Ngb-VDAC interaction. Ngb overexpression protected primary mouse cortical neurons from OGD-induced neuronal death, to an extent comparable to mPTP opening inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) pretreatment. We further measured the role of Ngb in OGD-induced mPTP opening using Ngb overexpression and knockdown approaches in primary cultured neurons, and recombinant Ngb exposure to isolated mitochondria. Same as CsA pretreatment, Ngb overexpression significantly reduced OGD-induced mPTP opening markers including mitochondria swelling, mitochondrial NAD(+) release, and cytochrome c (Cyt c) release in primary cultured neurons. Recombinant Ngb incubation significantly reduced OGD-induced NAD(+) release and Cyt c release from isolated mitochondria. In contrast, Ngb knockdown significantly increased OGD-induced neuron death, and increased OGD-induced mitochondrial NAD(+) release and Cyt c release as well, and these outcomes could be rescued by CsA pretreatment. In summary, our results demonstrated that Ngb overexpression can inhibit OGD-induced mPTP opening in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons, which may be one of the molecular mechanisms of Ngb's neuroprotection. labels: #Globins"
b'Neuroglobin is a member of the globin superfamily proposed to be only expressed in neurons and involved in neuronal protection from hypoxia or oxidative stress. A significant fraction of the protein localizes within the mitochondria and is directly associated with mitochondrial metabolism and integrity. The retina is the site of the highest concentration for neuroglobin and has been reported to be up to 100-fold higher than in the brain. Since neuroglobin was especially abundant in retinal ganglion cell layer, we investigated its abundance in optic nerves. Remarkably in optic nerves, neuroglobin is observed, as expected, in retinal ganglion cell axon profiles but also astrocyte processes, in physiological conditions, possess high levels of the protein. Neuroglobin mRNA and protein levels are ~10-fold higher in optic nerves than in retinas, indicating an important accumulation of neuroglobin in these support cells. Additionally, neuroglobin levels increase in M\xc3\xbcller cells during reactive gliosis in response to eye injury. This suggests the pivotal role of neuroglobin in retinal glia involved in neuronal support and/or healing.

b'We hypothesized that targeting key points in the ischemic cascade with combined neuroglobin (Ngb) overexpression and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibition (SP600125) would offer greater neuroprotection than single treatment after in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation and in a randomized, blinded in vivo experimental stroke study using a clinically relevant rat strain. Male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and were divided into the following groups: tMCAO; tMCAO+control GFP-expressing canine adenovirus-2, CAVGFP; tMCAO+Ngb-expressing CAV-2, CAVNgb; tMCAO+SP600125; tMCAO+CAVNgb+SP600125; or sham procedure. Rats were assessed till day 14 for neurologic outcome before infarct determination. In vitro, combined lentivirus-mediated Ngb overexpression+SP600125 significantly reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis compared with single treatment(s) after hypoxia/reoxygenation in B50 cells. In vivo, infarct volume was significantly reduced by CAVNgb, SP600125, and further by CAVNgb+SP600125. The number of Ngb-positive cells in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum was significantly increased 14 days after tMCAO in animals receiving CAVNgb. Neurologic outcome, measured using a 32-point neurologic score, significantly improved with CAVNgb+SP600125 compared with single treatments at 14 days after tMCAO. Combined Ngb overexpression with JNK inhibition reduced hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured neurons and reduced infarct and improved neurologic outcome more than single therapy after in vivo experimental stroke in hypertensive rats. labels: #Globins'
b'Erythropoiesis, a process of erythroid production, is controlled by several factors including oxygen level. In this study, the effect of oxygen tension on erythropoiesis was investigated in K562 erythroleukemic cell line and erythroid progenitor cells derived from normal and \xce\xb2-thalassemia/hemoglobin (Hb) E individuals. The enhanced erythroid differentiation specific markers including increased levels of \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2- and \xce\xb3-globin gene expressions, numbers of HbF positive cells and the presence of glycophorin A surface marker were observed during cell culture under hypoxic atmosphere. The result also showed that miR-210, one of the hypoxia-induced miRNAs, was up-regulated in K562 and \xce\xb2-thalassemia/HbE progenitor cells cultured under hypoxic condition. Inhibition of miR-210 expression leads to reduction of the globin gene expression and delayed maturation in K562 and erythroid progenitor cells. This indicated that miR-210 contributes to hypoxia-induced erythroid differentiation in both K562 cells and \xce\xb2-thalassemia/HbE erythroid progenitor cells. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), a neuron-specific heme-binding protein that binds O2, CO and NO reversibly, and promotes in vivo and in vitro cell survival after hypoxic and ischaemic insult. Although the mechanisms of this neuroprotection remain unknown, Ngb might play an important role in counteracting the adverse effects of ischaemic stroke and cerebral hypoxia. Several Ngb overexpressing mouse models have confirmed this hypothesis; however, these models were not yet exposed to in-depth behavioural characterisations. To investigate the potential changes in behaviour due to Ngb overexpression, heterozygous mice and wild type (WT) littermates were subjected to a series of cognitive and behavioural tests (i.e., the SHIRPA primary screening, the hidden-platform Morris water maze, passive avoidance learning, 47h cage activity, open field exploration, a dark-light transition box, an accelerating rotarod, a stationary beam, a wire suspension task and a gait test) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. No significant behavioural differences were found between WT and Ngb-overexpressing mice at three months old. However, one-year-old Ngb-overexpressing mice travelled more distance on the stationary beam compared with WT littermates. This result shows that the constitutive overexpression of Ngb might counteract the endogenous decrease of Ngb in crucial brain regions such as the cerebellum, thereby counteracting age-induced neuromotor dysfunction.

b"Chromatin loops are formed between enhancers and promoters and between insulators to regulate gene transcription in the eukaryotic genome. These transcription regulatory elements forming loops have highly acetylated histones. To understand the correlation between histone acetylation and chromatin loop formation, we inhibited the expression of histone acetyltransferase CBP and p300 in erythroid K562 cells and analyzed the chromatin structure of the \xce\xb2-globin locus. The proximity between the locus control region (LCR) and the active (G)\xce\xb3-globin gene was decreased in the \xce\xb2-globin locus when histones were hypoacetylated by the double knockdown of CBP and p300. Sensitivity to DNase I and binding of erythroid specific activators were reduced in the hypoacetylated LCR hypersensitive sites (HSs) and gene promoter. Interestingly, the chromatin loop between HS5 and 3'HS1 was formed regardless of the hypoacetylation of the \xce\xb2-globin locus. CTCF binding was maintained at HS5 and 3'HS1 in the hypoacetylated locus. Thus, these results indicate that histone acetylation contributes to chromatin looping through the formation of HSs in the LCR and gene promoter. However, looping between insulators appears to be independent from histone acetylation. labels: #Globins"
b"Cytoglobin (CYGB) is frequently downregulated in many types of human malignancies, and its exogenous overexpression reduces proliferation of cancer cells. Despite its implied tumour suppressor (TSG) functions, its exact role in carcinogenesis remains unclear as CYGB upregulation is also associated with tumour hypoxia and aggressiveness. In this study, we explore the TSG role of CYGB, its influence on the phenotype of cancerous cells under stress conditions and the clinical significance of CYGB expression and promoter methylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DNA methylation-dependent expression silencing of CYGB is demonstrated in both clinical samples and cell lines. CYGB promoter was more frequently methylated in lung adenocarcinomas (P = 1.4 \xc3\x97 10(-4)). Demethylation by 5'-azadeoxycytidine partially restored CYGB expression in cell lines. Interestingly, trichostatin A triggered upregulation of CYGB expression in cancer cell lines and downregulation in non-tumourigenic ones. CYGB mRNA expression in NSCLC surgical specimens correlated with that of HIF1\xce\xb1 and VEGFa (P<1 \xc3\x97 10(-4)). Overexpression of CYGB in cancer cell lines reduced cell migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, CYGB impaired cell proliferation, but only in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line (H358). Upon hydrogen peroxide treatment, CYGB protected cell viability, migratory potential and anchorage independence by attenuating oxidative injury. In hypoxia, CYGB overexpression decreased cell viability, augmented migration and anchorage independence in a cell-type-specific manner. In conclusion, CYGB revealed TSG properties in normoxia but promoted tumourigenic potential of the cells exposed to stress, suggesting a bimodal function in lung tumourigenesis, depending on cell type and microenvironmental conditions. labels: #Globins"
b'Surges of nitric oxide compromise mitochondrial respiration primarily by competitive inhibition of oxygen binding to cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) and are particularly injurious in neurons, which rely on oxidative phosphorylation for all their energy needs. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of the neuronal globin protein, neuroglobin, helps diminish protein nitration, preserve mitochondrial function and sustain ATP content of primary cortical neurons challenged by extended nitric oxide exposure. Specifically, in transgenic neurons, elevated neuroglobin curtailed nitric oxide-induced alterations in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, including baseline oxygen consumption, consumption coupled with ATP synthesis, proton leak and spare respiratory capacity. Concomitantly, activation of genes involved in sensing and responding to oxidative/nitrosative stress, including the early-immediate c-Fos gene and the phase II antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase-1, was diminished in neuroglobin-overexpressing compared to wild-type neurons. Taken together, these differences reflect a lesser insult produced by similar concentrations of nitric oxide in neuroglobin-overexpressing compared to wild-type neurons, suggesting that abundant neuroglobin buffers nitric oxide and raises the threshold of nitric oxide-mediated injury in neurons. labels: #Globins'
b'This study was designed to investigate the expression profile of CYGB, its potential neuroprotective function, and underlying molecular mechanisms using a model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury. Cygb mRNA and protein expression were evaluated within the first 36 h after the HI model was induced using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cygb mRNA expression was increased at 18 h in a time-dependent manner, and its level of protein expression increased progressively in 24 h. To verify the neuroprotective effect of CYGB, a gene transfection technique was employed. Cygb cDNA and shRNA delivery adenovirus systems were established (Cygb-cDNA-ADV and Cygb-shRNA-ADV, respectively) and injected into the brains of 3-day-old rats 4 days before they were induced with HI treatment. Rats from different groups were euthanized 24 h post-HI, and brain samples were harvested. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride, TUNEL, and Nissl staining indicated that an up-regulation of CYGB resulted in reduced acute brain injury. The superoxide dismutase level was found to be dependent on expression of CYGB. The Morris water maze test in 28-day-old rats demonstrated that CYGB expression was associated with improvement of long term cognitive impairment. Studies also demonstrated that CYGB can up-regulate mRNA and protein levels of VEGF and increase both the density and diameter of the microvessels but inhibits activation of caspase-2 and -3. Thus, this is the first in vivo study focusing on the neuroprotective role of CYGB. The reduction of neonatal HI injury by CYGB may be due in part to antioxidant and antiapoptotic mechanisms and by promoting angiogenesis. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a respiratory protein that is preferentially expressed in brain of mouse and man. In this article, Tibetan antelope, living at altitude of 3 000-5 000 m for millions of years, was selected as the model of hypoxia-tolerant adaptation species. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot techniques, expression of Ngb gene was amplified and analyzed in antelope brain tissue. Our results showed that Ngb homology protein in Tibetan antelope was identified with more sequence similarity with cattle (96%), sheep (95%), and human (95%). We detected that there were some mutations occurred in the Open Reading Frame of Ngb in Tibetan antelope compared with sheep. Phylogenetic analysis of Ngb chain showed that it was closer to cattle than the others. This study suggests possible roles of central nervous system enriched Ngb in adaptation of Tibetan antelope to extremely high altitude. labels: #Globins'
b'This work deals with dioxygen (O2 ) binding sites and pathways through inducible human heme oxygenase (HO-1). The experimentally known distal binding site 1, and sites 2-3 above it, could be reproduced by means of non-deterministic random-acceleration molecular-dynamics (RAMD) simulations. In addition, RAMD revealed the proximal binding site 5, a deeply-seated binding site 4, which lies behind heme, as well as a few gates communicating with the external medium. In getting from site 1 to the main gate, which lies on the protein front opposed to site 4, O2 follows chiefly the shortest direct pathway. Less frequently, O2 visits intermediate sites 2, 4, or 5 along longer pathways. A similarity between HO-1, myoglobin, and cytoglobin in using, for diatomic gas delivery, the direct shortest pathway from the heme center to the surrounding medium, is emphasized. Otherwise, comparing other proteins and diatomic gases, each system reveals its peculiarities as to sites, gates, and pathways. Thus, relating these properties to the physiological functions of the proteins remains in general a challenge for future studies. labels: #Globins'
b'A bioinformatics survey of putative globins in over 2200 bacterial and some 140 archaeal genomes revealed that over half the bacterial and approximately one fifth of archaeal genomes contain genes encoding globins that were classified into three families: the M (myoglobin-like), and S (sensor) families all exhibiting the canonical 3/3 myoglobin fold, and the T family (truncated myoglobin fold). Although the M family comprises 2 subfamilies, flavohemoglobins (FHbs) and single domain globins (SDgbs), the S family encompasses chimeric globin-coupled sensors (GCSs), single domain Pgbs (protoglobins) and SSDgbs (sensor single domain globins). The T family comprises three classes TrHb1s, TrHb2s and TrHb3s, characterized by the abbreviated 2/2 myoglobin fold. The Archaea contain only Pgbs, GCSs and TrHb1s. The smallest globin-bearing genomes are the streamlined genomes (~1.3Mbp) of the SAR11 clade of alphaproteobacteria and the slightly larger (ca. 1.7Mbp) genomes of Aquificae. The smallest genome with members of all three families is the 2.3Mbp genome of the extremophile Methylacidiphilum infernorum (Verrumicrobia). Of the 147 possible combinations of the eight globin subfamilies, only 83 are observed. Although binary combinations are infrequent and ternary combinations are rare, the FHb+TrHb2 combination is the most commonly observed. Of the possible functions of bacterial globins we discuss the two principal ones - nitric oxide detoxification via the NO dioxygenase or denitrosylase activities and the sensing of oxygen concentration in the environmental niche. In only few cases has a physiological role been demonstrated in vivo. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxygen Binding and Sensing Proteins. labels: #Globins'
b"Differentiation-therapy is an important approach in the treatment of cancer, as in the case of erythroid induction in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Moreover, an important therapeutic strategy for treating beta-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia could be the use of drugs able to induce erythroid differentiation and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) accumulation: in fact, the increased production of this type of hemoglobin can reduce the clinical symptoms and the frequency of transfusions. An important class of erythroid differentiating compounds and HbF inducers is composed by DNA-binding chemotherapeutics: however, they are not used in most instances considering their possible devastating side effects. In this contest, we approached the study of erythrodifferentiating properties of furocoumarins. In fact, upon UV-A irradiation, they are able to covalently bind DNA. Thus, the erythrodifferentiation activity of some linear and angular furocoumarins was evaluated in the experimental K562 cellular model system. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction assay was employed to evaluate the accumulation of different globin mRNAs. The results demonstrated that both linear and angular furocoumarins are strong inducers of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. From a preliminary screening, we selected the most active compounds and investigated the role of DNA photodamage in their erythroid inducing activity and mechanism of action. Moreover, some cytofluorimetric experiments were carried out to better study cell cycle modifications and the mitochondrial involvement. A further development of the work was carried out studying the erythroid differentiation of photolysis products of these molecules. 5,5'-Dimethylpsoralen photoproducts induced an important increase in \xce\xb3-globin gene transcription in K562 cells. labels: #Globins"
b'Globins constitute a superfamily of heme-binding proteins that is widely present in many species. There are 33 putative globins in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, where glb-13 is a homolog of neuroglobin (Ngb) based on sequence analysis and specific expression in neurons. Here we examined whether glb-13 as well as Ngb is also associated with resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by paraquat. Our results showed that the mRNA level of glb-13 was significantly upregulated after paraquat exposure. Expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene directed by the glb-13 promoter was increased by paraquat exposure. The mutant C. elegans strain glb-13(tm2825) was sensitive to paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Overexpression of human Ngb (hNgb) in C. elegans neuronal cells can rescue the paraquat sensitive phenotype of the mutant strain. glb-13 mutation or hNgb overexpression did not affect the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD). To examine the ROS-scavenging capabilities of hNgb and glb-13, we further examined the level of ROS in glb-13 mutant and hNgb transgenic (hNgb-Tg) worms. There was no statistical difference in ROS levels in the untreated controls; however in paraquat-treated worms, the ROS level was statistically repressed in the hNgb-Tg relative to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Tg worms or wildtype animals. Additionally, the ROS level of glb-13 mutant was statistically higher than the wildtype animals. Furthermore, hNgb overexpression diminished the ROS level of glb-13 mutant. In conclusion, hNgb can rescue the ROS sensitive phenotype of the glb-13 mutant strain. The protein GLB-13 seems to have an hNgb-like function, suggesting the importance of the globin protein family in maintaining the homeostasis of ROS signals. Our data provided evidence for the first time that glb-13 is associated with the resistance against oxidative stress-induced toxicity. labels: #Globins'
b'Functional and structural properties of protoglobin from Methanosarcina acetivorans, whose Cys(101)E20 residue was mutated to Ser (MaPgb*), and of mutants missing either the first 20 N-terminal amino acids (MaPgb*-\xce\x94N20 mutant), or the first 33 N-terminal amino acids [N-terminal loop of 20 amino acids and a 13-residue Z-helix, preceding the globin fold A-helix; (MaPgb*-\xce\x94N20Z mutant)] have been investigated. In keeping with the MaPgb*-\xce\x94N20 mutant crystal structure, here reported at 2.0\xc3\x85 resolution, which shows an increased exposure of the haem propionates to the solvent, the analysis of ligand binding kinetics highlights high accessibility of ligands to the haem pocket in ferric MaPgb*-\xce\x94N20. CO binding to ferrous MaPgb*-\xce\x94N20 displays a marked biphasic behavior, with a fast binding process close to that observed in MaPgb* and a slow carbonylation process, characterized by a rate-limiting step. Conversely, removal of the first 33 residues induces a substantial perturbation of the overall MaPgb* structure, with loss of \xce\xb1-helical content and potential partial collapse of the protein chain. As such, ligand binding kinetics are characterized by very slow rates that are independent of ligand concentration, this being indicative of a high energy barrier for ligand access to the haem, possibly due to localized misfolding.

b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered vertebrate heme protein that is expressed in the brain and can reversibly bind oxygen. Mammalian Ngb is involved in neuroprotection under conditions of oxidative stress, such as ischemia and reperfusion. We previously found that zebrafish Ngb can penetrate the mammalian cell membrane. In the present study, we investigated the functional characteristics of fish Ngb by using the zebrafish cell line ZF4 and zebrafish retina. We found that zebrafish Ngb translocates into ZF4 cells, but cannot protect ZF4 cells against cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a chimeric ZHHH Ngb protein, in which module M1 of human Ngb is replaced by that of zebrafish, is a cell-membrane-penetrating protein that can protect ZF4 cells against hydrogen peroxide exposure. Moreover, we investigated the localization of Ngb mRNA and protein in zebrafish retina and found that Ngb mRNA is expressed in amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer and is significantly increased in amacrine cells 3days after optic nerve injury. Immunohistochemical studies clarified that Ngb protein levels were increased in both amacrine cells and presynaptic regions in the inner plexiform layer after nerve injury. Taken together, we hypothesize that fish Ngb, whose expression is upregulated in amacrine cells after optic nerve injury, might be released from amacrine cells, translocate into neighboring ganglion cells, and function in the early stage of optic nerve regeneration.

b'Hypoxia and oxidative stress are critical factors in carcinogenesis and exist throughout cancer development; however, the underlying mechanisms are far from clear. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we reported that neuroglobin (Ngb), an intracellular hexa-coordinated globin serving as an oxygen/reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor, functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC). Ngb protein and mRNA expression were significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues, compared with its adjacent non-tumor tissues of human HCC samples and normal liver tissues. Knock-down of Ngb by RNA interference promoted human HCC cell line (HepG2) growth and proliferation, G0/G1-S transition in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. On the contrary, overexpression of Ngb suppressed HepG2 cell growth and proliferation, G0/G1-S transition, colony formation in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. These results established a tumor suppressor function of Ngb in HCC. The underlying mechanisms were further investigated. Overexpression of Ngb suppressed Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), whereas knockdown of Ngb enhanced Raf/MEK/Erk activation in HepG2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down showed that Ngb interacted with c-Raf-1 in HepG2 cells. Overexpression of Ngb suppressed serum- and H\xe2\x82\x82O\xe2\x82\x82-stimulated Erk activation in HepG2 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Erk activation abolished the proliferative effect of Ngb knockdown in HepG2 cells. Mutation of Ngb at its oxygen-binding site (H64L) abolished the inhibitory effects of Ngb on Erk activation and HepG2 cell proliferation. Therefore, we propose that Ngb controls HCC development by linking oxygen/ROS signals to oncogenic Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Erk signaling. Our data suggest that neuroglobin could be a new target for cancer therapy. labels: #Globins'
b'Hypoxic-ischemic injury increases neuroglobin (Ngb) expression in the brain. In our previous study, we have generated a transactivator-of-transcription protein-transduction domain-neuroglobin fusion protein (TAT PTD-Ngb) that successfully mediated exogenous Ngb expression in the primary neurons. In this study, we further investigated the role of TAT PTD-Ngb in protecting neurons against hypoxia-induced apoptosis and explored the possible mechanism. The primary cultured neurons were divided into four groups: (1) the normal group (no hypoxic injury); (2) the vehicle group (vehicle treatment and hypoxia injury); (3) the TAT PTD-Ngb group (TAT PTD-Ngb treatment and hypoxia injury); and (4) the Ngb group (Ngb treatment and hypoxia injury). Translocation of TAT PTD-Ngb into neurons was detected using fluorescent immunostaining against His-tag as early as 30\xc2\xa0min after incubation. MTT assay showed that the TAT PTD-Ngb group had significantly increased cell viability compared to the vehicle or Ngb group after hypoxia. The result of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also displayed rescued ultrastructure in TAT PTD-Ngb neurons compared to that of apoptotic neurons. In addition, TAT PTD-Ngb neurons showed significantly increased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and decreased activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in response to hypoxia. These results suggest that TAT PTD-Ngb fusion protein protects primary cortical neurons against hypoxia-induced injury possibly through suppressing mitochondria apoptotic pathway. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of trospium chloride and tolterodine on the renal parenchymal inflammatory process and upper urinary dilation in rats with chronic partial upper urinary tract obstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 32 rats were divided into 4 groups: group 1, control; group 2, obstruction; group 3, obstruction plus tolterodine; and group 4, obstruction plus trospium chloride. In all groups, except for group 1, partial upper urinary tract obstruction was induced by embedding the upper quarter of the right ureter into the psoas muscle for 14 days. At the end of the experiment, the rats were killed. The catalase, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl levels were determined in renal tissue. Tubular dilation and parenchymal inflammation were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Smooth muscle actin and cytoglobin were examined with immunohistochemical staining.RESULTS: The obstruction group demonstrated severe pelvic dilation and parenchymal inflammation and increased smooth muscle actin staining in the wall of upper urinary tract (P\xc2\xa0<.05). The treatment of the rats with tolterodine and trospium chloride markedly attenuated the inflammatory alterations and reduced tubular dilation. This treatment also reduced elevated oxidative stress product levels and restored the depleted renal antioxidant enzyme.CONCLUSION: These findings imply that increased renal pelvic pressure can contribute to renal parenchymal injury in chronic pelvic upper urinary tract obstruction. Antimuscarinic medications such as tolterodine and trospium chloride exert renoprotective effects, probably by prevention of pelvic pressure increases. labels: #Globins'
b'The sex steroid hormone 17\xce\xb2-estradiol (E2) upregulates the levels of neuroglobin (NGB), a new neuroprotectant globin, to elicit its neuroprotective effect against H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Several mechanisms could be proposed to justify the NGB involvement in E2 prevention of stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Here, we evaluate the ability of E2 to modulate the intracellular NGB localization and the NGB interaction with mitochondrial cytochrome c following the H(2)O(2)-induced toxicity. Present results demonstrate that NGB is expressed in the nuclei, mitochondria, and cytosol of human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells. E2, but not H(2)O(2) treatment of SK-N-BE cells, reallocates NGB mainly at the mitochondria and contemporarily reduces the number of apoptotic nuclei and the levels of cleaved caspase-3. Remarkably, the E2 treatment strongly increases NGB-cytochrome c association into mitochondria and reduces the levels of cytochrome c into the cytosol of SK-N-BE cells. Although both estrogen receptors (ER\xce\xb1 and ER\xce\xb2) are expressed in the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytosol of SK-N-BE cells, this E2 effect specifically requires the mitochondrial ER\xce\xb2 activity. As a whole, these data demonstrate that the interception of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway into mitochondria (i.e., the prevention of cytochrome c release) is one of the pivotal mechanisms underlying E2-dependent NGB neuroprotection against H(2)O(2) toxicity. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequent form of senile dementia. Neuroglobin (Ngb) has a neuroprotective role and decreases A\xce\xb2 peptide levels. Ngb, promoting Akt phosphorylation, activates cell survival involving cyclic-nucleotide response element-binding protein (CREB). A new molecule (IBU-LA) was synthetized and administered to an AD rat model to counteract AD progression.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the IBU-LA-mediated induction of Ngb neuroprotective and antiapoptotic activities.METHODS: Brain morphology was analyzed through Bielschowsky staining, A\xce\xb2(1-40) and Ngb expression by immunohistochemistry. Akt, p-Akt, CREB and p-CREB expression was evaluated by Western blot, apoptosis through cytochrome C/Apaf 1 immunocomplex formation, and TUNEL analysis.RESULTS: Bielschowsky staining and A\xce\xb2(1-40) expression show few nerve connections and A\xce\xb2(1-40) expression in an A\xce\xb2 sample, preserved neuronal cells and A\xce\xb2(1-40) expression lowering in an IBU sample, mostly in IBU-LA. The Ngb level decreases in A\xce\xb2 samples, compared to control and IBU-LA samples. p-Akt/Akt and p-CREB/CREB ratios reveal a reduction in A\xce\xb2 sample, going back to the basal level in control and IBU-LA samples. Cytochrome C/Apaf 1 co-immunoprecipitate occurs and TUNEL-positive nuclei percentage decreases in A\xce\xb2 sample. Probe test performance shows an increased spatial reference memory in the IBU-LA compared to the A\xce\xb2 sample; no significant differences were seen between the IBU-LA and IBU samples.CONCLUSION: This evidence reveals that IBU-LA administration has the capability to maintain a high Ngb level allowing Ngb to perform a neuroprotective and antiapoptotic role, representing a valid tool in the therapeutic strategy of AD progression. labels: #Globins"
b'Human genome sequencing has resulted in a great body of data, including a stunningly large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with unknown phenotypic manifestations. Identification and comprehensive analysis of regulatory SNPs in human gene promoters will help quantify the effects of these SNPs on human health. Based on our experimental and computer-aided study of SNPs in TATA boxes and the use of literature data, we have derived an equation for TBP/TATA equilibrium binding in three successive steps: TATA-binding protein (TBP) sliding along DNA due to their nonspecific affinity for each other \xe2\x86\x94 recognition of the TATA box \xe2\x86\x94 stabilization of the TBP/TATA complex. Using this equation, we have analyzed TATA boxes containing SNPs associated with human diseases and made in silico predictions of changes in TBP/TATA affinity. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)-based experimental study performed under the most standardized conditions demonstrates that the experimentally measured values are highly correlated with the predicted values: the coefficient of linear correlation, r, was 0.822 at a significance level of \xce\xb1<10\xe2\x81\xbb\xe2\x81\xb7 for equilibrium K(D) values, (-ln K(D)), and 0.785 at a significance level of \xce\xb1<10\xe2\x81\xbb\xc2\xb3 for changes in equilibrium K(D) (\xce\xb4) due to SNPs in the TATA boxes (\xce\xb4= -ln[K(D,TATAMut)]-(-ln[K(D,TATAMut)])). It has been demonstrated that the SNPs associated with increased risk of human diseases such as \xce\xb1-, \xce\xb2- and \xce\xb4-thalassemia, myocardial infarction and thrombophlebitis, changes in immune response, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lung cancer and hemophilia B Leyden cause 2-4-fold changes in TBP/TATA affinity in most cases. The results obtained strongly suggest that the TBP/TATA equilibrium binding equation derived can be used for analysis of TATA-box sequences and identification of SNPs with a potential of being functionally important. labels: #Globins'
b'Multimeric globins (e.g., hemoglobin) are considered to be the prototypes of allosteric enzymes, whereas monomeric globins (e.g., myoglobin; Mb) usually are assumed to be non-allosteric. However, the modulation of the functional properties of monomeric globins by non-covalent (or allosteric) and covalent modifications casts doubts on this general assumption. Here, we report examples referable to these two extreme mechanisms modulating the reactivity of three mammalian monomeric globins. Sperm whale Mb, which acts as a reserve supply of O2 and facilitates the O2 flux within a myocyte, displays the allosteric modulation of the O2 affinity on lactate, an obligatory product of glycolysis under anaerobic conditions, thus facilitating O2 diffusion to the mitochondria in supporting oxidative phosphorylation. Human neuroglobin (NGB), which appears to protect neurons from hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, undergoes hypoxia-dependent phosphorylation (i.e., covalent modulation) affecting the coordination equilibrium of the heme-Fe atom and, in turn, the heme-protein reactivity. This facilitates heme-Fe-ligand binding and enhances the rate of anaerobic nitrite reduction to form NO, thus contributing to cellular adaptation to hypoxia. The reactivity of human cytoglobin (CYGB), which has been postulated to protect cells against oxidative stress, depends on both non-covalent and covalent mechanisms. In fact, the heme reactivity of CYGB depends on the lipid, such as oleate, binding which stabilizes the penta-coordination geometry of the heme-Fe atom. Lastly, the reactivity of NGB and CYGB is modulated by the redox state of the intramolecular CysCD7/CysD5 and CysB2/CysE9 residue pairs, respectively, affecting the heme-Fe atom coordination state. In conclusion, the modulation of monomeric globins reactivity by non-covalent and covalent modifications appears a very widespread phenomenon, opening new perspectives in cell survival and protection.

b'Neuroglobin, a globin characterized by a bis-histidine ligation of the heme iron, has been identified in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates, including fish, amphibians and reptiles. In human neuroglobin, the presence of an internal disulfide bond in the CD loop (CD7-D5) is found to modulate the ligand binding through a change in the heme pocket structure. Although the neuroglobin sequences mostly display conserved Cys at positions CD7, D5 and G18/19, a number of exceptions are known. In this study, neuroglobins from amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis) and fish (Chaenocephalus aceratus, Dissostichus mawsoni and Danio rerio) are investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectroscopy. All these neuroglobins differ from human neuroglobin in their Cys-positions. It is demonstrated that if disulfide bonds are formed in fish and amphibian neuroglobins, the reduction of these bonds does not result in alteration of the heme pocket in these globins. Furthermore, it is shown that mutagenesis of the Cys residues of X. tropicalis neuroglobin influences the protein structure. The amphibian neuroglobin is also found to be more resistant to H2O2-induced denaturation than the other neuroglobins under study, although all show an overall large stability in high concentrations of this oxidant.

b"Hell's gate globin I (HGbI), a heme-containing protein from the extremophile Methylacidiphilum infernorum, has fast oxygen-binding/slow release characteristics due to its distal residues Gln and Tyr. The combination of Gln/Tyr distal iron coordination, adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, and lack of a D helix suggests that ligand migration in HGbI differs from other previously studied globins. Locally enhanced molecular dynamics trajectories of oxygen migration indicate a large internal cavity. This may increase the tendency of oxygen to exit from portals other than the most direct exit from the space near the heme. Oxygen may reside transiently in shallow surface depressions around the exits. Such surface trapping may enhance both oxygen uptake by increasing contact time between molecules, and decrease release by increasing the probability of oxygen reentry from the vicinity of the portal. labels: #Globins"
b'B-cell lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) downregulation in human primary adult erythroid progenitors results in elevated expression of fetal \xce\xb3-globin. Recent reports showed that BCL11A expression is activated by KLF1, leading to \xce\xb3-globin repression. To study regulation of erythropoiesis and globin expression by KLF1 and BCL11A in an in vivo model, we used mice carrying a human \xce\xb2-globin locus transgene with combinations of Klf1 knockout, Bcl11a floxed, and EpoR(Cre) knockin alleles. We found a higher percentage of reticulocytes in adult Klf1(wt/ko) mice and a mild compensated anemia in Bcl11a(cko/cko) mice. These phenotypes were more pronounced in compound Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) mice. Analysis of Klf1(wt/ko), Bcl11a(cko/cko), and Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) mutant embryos demonstrated increased expression of mouse embryonic globins during fetal development. Expression of human \xce\xb3-globin remained high in Bcl11a(cko/cko) embryos during fetal development, and this was further augmented in Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) embryos. After birth, expression of human \xce\xb3-globin and mouse embryonic globins decreased in Bcl11a(cko/cko) and Klf1(wt/ko)::Bcl11a(cko/cko) mice, but the levels remained much higher than those observed in control animals. Collectively, our data support an important role for the KLF1-BCL11A axis in erythroid maturation and developmental regulation of globin expression. labels: #Globins'
b'The (hemo-)globins are among the best-investigated proteins in biomedical sciences. These small heme-proteins play an important role in oxygen supply, but may also have other functions. In addition to well known hemoglobin and myoglobin, six other vertebrate globin types have been identified in recent years: neuroglobin, cytoglobin, globin E, globin X, globin Y, and androglobin. Analyses of the genome of the "living fossil" Latimeria chalumnae show that the coelacanth is the only known vertebrate that includes all eight globin types. Thus, Latimeria can also be considered as a "globin fossil". Analyses of gene synteny and phylogenetic reconstructions allow us to trace the evolution and the functional changes of the vertebrate globin family. Neuroglobin and globin X diverged from the other globin types before the separation of Protostomia and Deuterostomia. The cytoglobins, which are unlikely to be involved in O2 supply, form the earliest globin branch within the jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata), but do not group with the agnathan hemoglobins, as it has been proposed before. There is strong evidence from phylogenetic reconstructions and gene synteny that the eye-specific globin E and muscle-specific myoglobin constitute a common clade, suggesting a similar role in intracellular O2 supply. Latimeria possesses two \xce\xb1- and two \xce\xb2-hemoglobin chains, of which one \xce\xb1-chain emerged prior to the divergence of Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, but has been retained only in the coelacanth. Notably, the embryonic hemoglobin \xce\xb1-chains of Gnathostomata derive from a common ancestor, while the embryonic \xce\xb2-chains - with the exception of a more complex pattern in the coelacanth and amphibians - display a clade-specific evolution. Globin Y is associated with the hemoglobin gene cluster, but its phylogenetic position is not resolved. Our data show an early divergence of distinct globin types in the vertebrate evolution before the emergence of tetrapods. The subsequent loss of globins in certain taxa may be associated with changes in the oxygen-dependent metabolism.

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning on cerebral ischemia and the role of cerebral neuroglobin (NgB) in EA-induced brain protection in focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury (CI/RI) rats.METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly assigned to sham control, CI/RI 6 h, CI/RI 24 h and CI/RI 72 h groups (n = 6) for observing changes of NgB at different time-points. Additional SD rats were randomly assigned to sham, model, and EA preconditioning (EA-PC) groups (n = 16) for observing changes of cerebral NgB positive cell counts in the ischemic penumbra region 24 h after reperfusion. EA pre-conditioning was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20) for 30 min, once daily for 5 days before CI/RI. CI/RI model was established by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery and reperfusion for 6 h, 24 h and 72 h respectively. The neurological behavior scores (NBS) of all the rats were evaluated according to Garcia\'s methods. The cerebral infarct volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The number of cerebral NgB positive cells was detected by immunofluorescent staining.RESULTS: No infarct loci were found in the sham group. The cerebral infarction volume percentage was significantly higher in the model group than in the EA-PC group (P<0.01), while the NBS was significantly lower in the model group than in the EA-PC group (P<0.01). The number of cerebral NgB positive cells in the ischemic penumbra was up-regulated 6 h after CI/RI injury, peaked at 24 h and continued at 72 h. Compared with the sham group, the number of cerebral NgB positive cells of the model group was increased significantly, whereas that of the EA-PC group up-regulated further obviously in comparison with the model group (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: EA pretreatment has a significant neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, which is closely related to its effect in up-regulating NgB protein expression. labels: #Globins'
b'This work discloses two bona fide gates through which the CO ligand can leave the distal cavity of carboxy human cytoglobin, reaching the solvent. The investigation was based on molecular dynamics, aided by a minimal randomly-oriented force applied to the ligand. The shortest pathway progresses toward the main gate, H81-R84, in the open state, with the H81 imidazole moiety turned toward the solvent. A longer pathway develops toward the diametrically opposed W31-W151 gate. In between, CO may be entrapped into binding cavities, either along the path toward the gates, or in a cul-de-sac, from which CO may even be incapable to escape. This behavior contrasts with carboxy myoglobin, where the corresponding H64 gate, when opened, is the sole used by CO to get to the solvent. These observations, which could hold also for other small ligands of biological interest, such as O(2), NO, and NO(3)(-), provide an answer to a neglected aspect of the mysterious six-coordinated globins. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Changes in the intestinal and colonic proteome in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) may help to characterize the disease pathology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets for NEC.METHODS: Using gel-based proteomics, proteins in NEC-affected intestinal and colonic sections were compared with those in adjacent, near-normal tissue sections within the same patients. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were applied to crossvalidate proteomic data and histological location of some selected proteins.RESULTS: Thirty proteins were identified with differential expression between necrotic and vital small-intestine sections and 23 proteins were identified for colon sections. Five proteins were similarly affected in the small intestine and colon: histamine receptors (HRs), actins, globins, immunoglobulin, and antitrypsin. Two heat shock proteins (HSPs) were affected in the small intestine. Furthermore, proteins involved in antioxidation, angiogenesis, cytoskeleton formation, and metabolism were affected. Finally, secretory proteins such as antitrypsin, fatty-acid binding protein 5, and haptoglobin differed between NEC-affected and vital tissues.CONCLUSION: NEC progression affects different pathways in the small intestine and colon. HSPs may play an important role, especially in the small intestine. The identified secretory proteins should be investigated as possible circulating markers of NEC progression in different gut regions. labels: #Globins'
b'AIMS: The carotid body (CB) represents the prime site for detecting and responding to hypoxia. Since the role of heroin in respiratory depression with consequent hypoxia is known, the authors were able to investigate morphological and molecular modifications occurring in the CB of heroin addicted subjects compared to subjects who died because of trauma.METHODS AND RESULTS: CB sampled from six 27 year old subjects, slides were treated with Mallory Trichrome staining or used for immunohistochemical analysis to detect Neuroglobin (NGB), Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1\xce\xb1), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (i-NOS), Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 proteins. Mallory Trichrome staining shows an increase in the connective tissue in heroin subjects compared to controls and a parallel reduction in parenchymal area. Immunohistochemical analyses in heroin subjects found a decrease in NGB and an increase in HIF-1\xce\xb1 and VEGF compared to controls; i-NOS expression was not statistically significant. Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were positive only in the heroin subjects.CONCLUSIONS: These results could confirm the typical hypoxic condition occurring in heroin addicts. Since NGB may function as a reactive oxygen or nitrogen species scavenger and as apoptotic cell death protector, the decrease in its expression may suggest a key role of this globin in human CB impairment due to heroin addiction. labels: #Globins'
b'To investigate the protective effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified recombinant cytoglobin (PEG-rCygb) on acute liver damage in mice. The acute liver injury model of KM mice was induced by CCl4 and then treated with PEG-rCygb, The liver and blood samples were collected for biochemical and histopathological analysis. The results showed that PEG-rCygb reduced the liver mass index and decreased significantly the levels of alanine amiotransferase (AST) and aspartate transaminase (ALT) in mouse serum. In liver tissues, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased, whereas the content of glutathione (GSH) was increased in PEG-rCygb treated group. PEG-rCygb also elevated the activities of total super oxidedismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) in liver tissues. HE staining of liver tissue slices revealed that PEG-rCygb relieved fatty degeneration of liver, decreased inflammatory factors and reduced liver cell injury. Further in vitro experiments indicated that the protective effects of PEG-rCygb on hepatic stellate cell (HSC) against H2O2 were enhanced compared with that of rCygb. All results indicated that the PEG-rCygb promoted oxygen free radical scavenging ability and prevented acute liver injury in KM mice induced by CCl4. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) was recently discovered in the human genome and localized in different tissues. It was suggested to play tissue-specific protective roles, spanning from scavenging of reactive oxygen species in neurons to supplying oxygen to enzymes in fibroblasts. To shed light on the functioning of such versatile machinery, we have studied the processes supporting transport of gaseous heme ligands in Cygb. Carbon monoxide rebinding shows a complex kinetic pattern with several distinct reaction intermediates, reflecting rebinding from temporary docking sites, second order recombination, and formation (and dissociation) of a bis-histidyl heme hexacoordinated reaction intermediate. Ligand exit to the solvent occurs through distinct pathways, some of which exploit temporary docking sites. The remarkable change in energetic barriers, linked to heme bis-histidyl hexacoordination by HisE7, may be responsible for active regulation of the flux of reactants and products to and from the reaction site on the distal side of the heme. A substantial change in both protein dynamics and inner cavities is observed upon transition from the CO-liganded to the pentacoordinated and bis-histidyl hexacoordinated species, which could be exploited as a signalling state. These findings are consistent with the expected versatility of the molecular activity of this protein. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cytoglobin (Cygb) is the newest globin family and is upregulated during hypoxia to maintain the oxygen status. Herein, we investigated Cygb expression in both acute and chronic gastric mucosal injuries.METHODS: Acute gastric mucosal injuries in rats were produced by oral administration of indomethacin, followed by sacrifice at 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h. Gastric ulcer was produced by acetic acid, followed by sacrifice on days 3, 7, 11, 18, and 25. Each protein expression of Cygb and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\xce\xb1 was evaluated by western blotting. We measured vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA by RT-PCR and examined localization of Cygb by immunofluorescence.RESULTS: In indomethacin-induced injury, Cygb protein was significantly increased at 24 h. In ulcerated tissues, HIF-1\xce\xb1 protein was significantly increased on days 7 and 11 (1.83 \xc2\xb1 0.11 and 2.12 \xc2\xb1 0.19 folds, respectively, p<0.05 and 0.01), which corresponded to the early healing phase. In contrast, Cygb protein was significantly increased on days 11 and 18 (1.87 \xc2\xb1 0.13 and 1.60 \xc2\xb1 0.06 folds, respectively, p<0.05), which demonstrated late phase. Though these proteins peaked on day 11, VEGF mRNA was gradually increased from day 11 to 18. Cygb was expressed in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in both acute and chronic models. Cygb and HIF-1\xce\xb1 were abundantly colocalized at the ulcer margin before angiogenesis development. However, faint localization was observed with angiogenesis.CONCLUSIONS: Cygb may be involved in the healing process of gastric mucosal injuries in the late phase without angiogenesis. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobins, previously thought to be restricted to vertebrate neurons, were detected in the brain of a photosymbiotic acoel, Symsagittifera roscoffensis, and in neurosensory cells of the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica. For the neuroglobin of S. roscoffensis, a member of a lineage that originated either at the base of the bilateria or of the deuterostome clade, we report the ligand binding properties, crystal structure at 2.3 \xc3\x85, and brain immunocytochemical pattern. We also describe in situ hybridizations of two neuroglobins specifically expressed in differentiating nematocytes (neurosensory cells) and in statocytes (ciliated mechanosensory cells) of C. hemisphaerica, a member of the early branching animal phylum cnidaria. In silico searches using these neuroglobins as queries revealed the presence of previously unidentified neuroglobin-like sequences in most metazoan lineages. Because neural systems are almost ubiquitous in metazoa, the constitutive expression of neuroglobin-like proteins strongly supports the notion of an intimate association of neuroglobins with the evolution of animal neural systems and hints at the preservation of a vitally important function. Neuroglobins were probably recruited in the first protoneurons in early metazoans from globin precursors. Neuroglobins were identified in choanoflagellates, sponges, and placozoans and were conserved during nervous system evolution. Because the origin of neuroglobins predates the other metazoan globins, it is likely that neuroglobin gene duplication followed by co-option and subfunctionalization led to the emergence of globin families in protostomes and deuterostomes (i.e. convergent evolution). labels: #Globins'
b"Aggregation is a social behavior that varies between and within species, providing a model to study the genetic basis of behavioral diversity. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, aggregation is regulated by environmental context and by two neuromodulatory pathways, one dependent on the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 and one dependent on the TGF-\xce\xb2 family protein DAF-7. To gain further insight into the genetic regulation of aggregation, we characterize natural variation underlying behavioral differences between two wild-type C. elegans strains, N2 and CB4856. Using quantitative genetic techniques, including a survey of chromosome substitution strains and QTL analysis of recombinant inbred lines, we identify three new QTLs affecting aggregation in addition to the two known N2 mutations in npr-1 and glb-5. Fine-mapping with near-isogenic lines localized one QTL, accounting for 5%-8% of the behavioral variance between N2 and CB4856, 3' to the transcript of the GABA neurotransmitter receptor gene exp-1. Quantitative complementation tests demonstrated that this QTL affects exp-1, identifying exp-1 and GABA signaling as new regulators of aggregation. exp-1 interacts genetically with the daf-7 TGF-\xce\xb2 pathway, which integrates food availability and population density, and exp-1 mutations affect the level of daf-7 expression. Our results add to growing evidence that genetic variation affecting neurotransmitter receptor genes is a source of natural behavioral variation. labels: #Globins"
b'Nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (nsHbs) form a widely distributed class of plant proteins, which function remains unknown. Despite the fact that class 1 plant nonsymbiotic hemoglobins are hexacoordinate (6c) heme proteins (hxHbs), their hexacoordination equilibrium constants are much lower than in hxHbs from animals or bacteria. In addition, they are characterized by having very high oxygen affinities and low oxygen dissociation rate constants. Rice hemoglobin 1 (rHb1) is a class 1 nonsymbiotic hemoglobin. It crystallizes as a fully associated homodimer with both subunits in 6c state, but showing slightly different conformations, thus leading to an asymmetric crystallographic homodimer. The residues that constitute the dimeric interface are conserved among all nsHbs, suggesting that the quaternary structure could be relevant to explain the chemical behavior and biological function of this family of proteins. In this work, we analyze the molecular basis that determine the hexacoordination equilibrium in rHb1. Our results indicate that dynamical features of the quaternary structure significantly affect the hexacoordination process. Specifically, we observe that the pentacoordinate state is stabilized in the dimer with respect to the isolated monomers. Moreover, the dimer behaves asymmetrically, in a negative cooperative scheme. The results presented in this work are fully consistent with our previous hypothesis about the key role played by the nature of the CD region in determining the coordination state of globins. labels: #Globins'
b"Chironomus Meigen (Diptera, Chironomidae) larvae are usually the largest sediment-burrowing chironomids, and as such often constitute a major part of the freshwater infaunal biomass. However, use of this genus in ecological, environmental and paleoecological studies is hampered by the fact that Chironomus larvae are difficult to identify to species because the larvae of many species are morphologically similar. We used a combination of morphological, cytological and genetic techniques to distinguish Chironomus larvae collected from 31 water bodies located in eastern Canada, producing 17 distinguishable groupings. These groups of larvae were ultimately identified as belonging to 14 known species (C. anthracinus, C. bifurcatus, C. cucini, C. decorus-group sp. 2, C. dilutus, C. entis, C. frommeri, C. harpi, C. maturus, C. nr. atroviridis (sp. 2i), C. ochreatus, C. plumosus, C. staegeri and C. 'tigris') and three other species that remain unidentified (C. sp. NAI-III). No single approach served to delimit and identify larvae of all 17 Chironomus species that we collected. Although we expected that morphological criteria alone would be insufficient, our results suggest that DNA barcoding, using either the mitochondrial cox1 or the nuclear gb2\xce\xb2 gene, was also inadequate for separating some Chironomus species. Thus we suggest that multiple approaches will often be needed to correctly identify Chironomus larvae to species. labels: #Globins"
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb), a protein located in the mammal's brain, is involved in oxygen transport and free radical scavenging inside the neurons. Ngb colocalizes with choline acetyltransferase in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and in the pontine tegmental nucleus, both involved in the sleep-wake cycle regulation. Some studies have shown that free radicals accumulated during prolonged wakefulness are removed during sleep. Therefore, Ngb could act as a regulator of free radicals generated during prolonged wakefulness in the brain. The aim of this study was to determine whether prolonged wakefulness affects Ngb immunoreactivity because of increases in the oxidative stress induced by continuous neuronal activity. For this purpose, male adult Wistar rats were implanted with electrodes for sleep recordings and were divided into control and sleep-deprived groups. Sleep deprivation was carried out for 24 h by gentle handling of the animals. Sleep-wake activity was determined during the deprivation period or 24\xe2\x80\x89h of control conditions. Subsequently, both groups of animals were killed and their brains were obtained and processed for Ngb immunohistochemical analysis and detection of lipid peroxidation. Our data found no evidence of increased oxidative stress in the brains of sleep-deprived animals compared with the controls. The number of Ngb-positive cells was decreased in the sleep-deprived animals in all analyzed areas of the brain compared with the control group. Our results suggest that Ngb could be involved in sleep regulation, independent of its role in the control of oxidative stress. labels: #Globins"
b'Methanosarcina acetivorans is a strictly anaerobic non-motile methane-producing Archaea expressing protoglobin (Pgb) which might either facilitate O(2) detoxification or act as a CO sensor/supplier in methanogenesis. Unusually, M. acetivorans Pgb (MaPgb) binds preferentially O(2) rather than CO and displays anticooperativity in ligand binding. Here, kinetics and/or thermodynamics of ferric and ferrous MaPgb (MaPgb(III) and MaPgb(II), respectively) nitrosylation are reported. Data were obtained between pH 7.2 and 9.5, at 22.0 \xc2\xb0C. Addition of NO to MaPgb(III) leads to the transient formation of MaPgb(III)-NO in equilibrium with MaPgb(II)-NO(+). In turn, MaPgb(II)-NO(+) is converted to MaPgb(II) by OH(-)-based catalysis. Then, MaPgb(II) binds NO very rapidly leading to MaPgb(II)-NO. The rate-limiting step for reductive nitrosylation of MaPgb(III) is represented by the OH(-)-mediated reduction of MaPgb(II)-NO(+) to MaPgb(II). Present results highlight the potential role of MaPgb in scavenging of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. labels: #Globins'
b'Globins occur in all kingdoms of life where they fulfill a wide variety of functions. In the past they used to be primarily characterized as oxygen transport/storage proteins, but since the discovery of new members of the globin family like neuroglobin and cytoglobin, more diverse and complex functions have been assigned to this heterogeneous family. Here we propose a function for a membrane-bound globin of C. elegans, GLB-26. This globin was predicted to be myristoylated at its N-terminus, a post-translational modification only recently described in the globin family. In vivo, this globin is found in the membrane of the head mesodermal cell and in the tail stomato-intestinal and anal depressor muscle cells. Since GLB-26 is almost directly oxidized when exposed to oxygen, we postulate a possible function as electron transfer protein. Phenotypical studies show that GLB-26 takes part in regulating the length of the defecation cycle in C. elegans under oxidative stress conditions. labels: #Globins'
b'We report the functional analysis of an artificial hexacoordinate oxygen transport protein, HP7, which operates via a mechanism similar to that of human neuroglobin and cytoglobin: the destabilization of one of two heme-ligating histidine residues. In the case of HP7, this is the result of the coupling of histidine side chain ligation with the burial of three charged glutamate residues on the same helix. Here we compare gaseous ligand binding, including rates, affinities, and oxyferrous state lifetimes, of both heme binding sites in HP7. We find that despite the identical sequence of helices in both binding sites, there are differences in oxygen affinity and oxyferrous state lifetime that may be the result of differences in the freedom of motion imposed by the candelabra fold on the two sites of the protein. We further examine the effect of mutational removal of the buried glutamates on function. Heme iron in the ferrous state of this mutant is rapidly oxidized when exposed to oxygen. Compared to that of HP7, the distal histidine affinity is increased by a 22-fold decrease in the histidine ligand off rate. Electron paramagnetic resonance comparison of these ferric hemoproteins demonstrates that the mutation increases the level of disorder at the heme binding site. Nuclear magnetic resonance-detected deuterium exchange demonstrates that the mutation greatly increases the degree of penetration of water into the protein core. The inability of the mutant protein to bind oxygen may be due to an increased level of water penetration, the large decrease in binding rate caused by the increase in distal histidine affinity, or a combination of the two factors. Together, these data underline the importance of the control of protein dynamics in the design of functional artificial proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'In this paper, a novel 3D graphical representation of DNA sequence based on codons is proposed. Since there is not loss of information due to overlapping and containing loops, this representation will be useful for comparison of different DNA sequences. This 3D curve will be convenient for DNA mutations comparison specially. In continues we give a numerical characterization of DNA sequences based on the new 3D curve. This characterization facilitates quantitative comparisons of similarities/dissimilarities analysis of DNA sequences based on codons. labels: #Globins'
b'The aim of this study was to investigate the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) of the anterior hypothalamus by resonance Raman spectroscopy (514.5 nm) to determine if it is possible to enhance the Raman scattering of hemoproteins in fresh brain tissue slices. The resonance effect was compared  with near-infrared Raman spectra. Two groups of male Sprague Dawley rats were studied, one control group on a normal diet and one group on a low-iron diet to evoke iron deficiency. Each group consisted of four rats, 38-41 days old. The diets lasted for 11, 12, and 15 days. The MPN regions  of brain tissue slices were analyzed by monitoring raw and pre-processed mean data, by cluster analysis, and by deriving difference spectra from pre-processed mean spectra. Cluster analysis of the resonance Raman spectra could identify different hemoprotein groups, namely, hemoglobin (Hb)  and neuroglobin (Ngb). Spectra from randomly distributed spots revealed high Hb content, whereas Ngb was evenly distributed in the MPN. The different spectra showed a decrease of the Ngb and lipid content for the animals on the low-iron diet. The Ngb decrease was approximately 20%. The data  show that resonance Raman spectroscopy is well suited to study hemoproteins in fresh brain tissue. labels: #Globins'
b'The Antarctic icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus lacks the globins common to most vertebrates, hemoglobin and myoglobin, but has retained neuroglobin in the brain. This conserved globin has been cloned, over-expressed and purified. To highlight similarities and differences, the structural features of the neuroglobin of this colourless-blooded fish were compared with those of the well characterised human neuroglobin as well as with the neuroglobin from the retina of the red blooded, hemoglobin and myoglobin-containing, closely related Antarctic notothenioid Dissostichus mawsoni. A detailed structural and functional analysis of the two Antarctic fish neuroglobins was carried out by UV-visible and Resonance Raman spectroscopies, molecular dynamics simulations and laser-flash photolysis. Similar to the human protein, Antarctic fish neuroglobins can reversibly bind oxygen and CO in the Fe(2+) form, and show six-coordination by distal His in the absence of exogenous ligands. A very large and structured internal cavity, with discrete docking sites, was identified in the modelled three-dimensional structures of the Antarctic neuroglobins. Estimate of the free-energy barriers from laser-flash photolysis and Implicit Ligand Sampling showed that the cavities are accessible from the solvent in both proteins.Comparison of structural and functional properties suggests that the two Antarctic fish neuroglobins most likely preserved and possibly improved the function recently proposed for human neuroglobin in ligand multichemistry. Despite subtle differences, the adaptation of Antarctic fish neuroglobins does not seem to parallel the dramatic adaptation of the oxygen carrying globins, hemoglobin and myoglobin, in the same organisms. labels: #Globins'
b'Heme synthesis partially occurs in the mitochondrial matrix; thus there is a high probability that enzymes and intermediates important in the production of heme will be exposed to metabolic by-products including reactive oxygen species. In addition, the need for ferrous iron for heme production, Fe/S coordination, and other processes occurring in the mitochondrial matrix suggests that aberrant fluxes of reactive oxygen species in this compartment might perturb normal iron homeostasis. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Sod2) is an antioxidant enzyme that governs steady-state levels of the superoxide in the mitochondrial matrix. Using hematopoietic stem cell-specific conditional Sod2 knockout mice we observed increased superoxide concentrations in red cell progeny, which caused significant pathologies including impaired erythrocytes and decreased ferrochelatase activity. Animals lacking Sod2 expression in erythroid precursors also displayed extramedullary hematopoiesis and systemic iron redistribution. Additionally, the increase in superoxide flux in erythroid precursors caused abnormal gene regulation of hematopoietic transcription factors, globins, and iron-response genes. Moreover, the erythroid precursors also displayed evidence of global changes in histone posttranslational modifications, a likely cause of at least some of the aberrant gene expression noted. From a therapeutic translational perspective, mitochondrially targeted superoxide-scavenging antioxidants partially rescued the observed phenotype. Taken together, our findings illuminate the superoxide sensitivity of normal iron homeostasis in erythrocyte precursors and suggest a probable link between mitochondrial redox metabolism and epigenetic control of nuclear gene regulation during mammalian erythropoiesis. labels: #Globins'
b'Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) are  enzymes that participate in diverse intracellular signaling pathways. They are  classified into 3 functionally distinct subfamilies - PIPKI (\xce\xb1, \xce\xb2, \xce\xb3), PIPKII  (\xce\xb1, \xce\xb2, \xce\xb3), and PIPKIII - located in various subcellular compartments. Recently,  the PIPKII\xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2-globin genes were found to be overexpressed in reticulocytes  from 2 siblings with hemoglobin H disease, suggesting a possible relationship  between PIPKIIa and the production of globins. The main aim of this study was  to determine the expression profiles of PIPK genes in healthy individuals  during in vitro erythropoiesis using quantitative real-time polymerase  chain reaction and to compare these profiles with profiles of globin genes. Our  results showed that expression of all PIPKs increases as the cells  differentiate, coinciding with the expression profiles of globins. Analysis of  the effects of globins on PIPK genes revealed that they varied significantly between  the globins, the most noticeable being the effect of \xce\xb1-globin on PIPKII\xce\xb1 (P<0.0001) and \xce\xb3-globin on PIPKII\xce\xb3 (P<0.0001). The relationship between  the expression of PIPKs and globin genes was statistically significant,  particularly between PIPKII\xce\xb1 and \xce\xb1-globin (P = 0.0002) and PIPKII\xce\xb3 and \xce\xb2-globin  (P<0.0001). Linear correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between  PIPKII\xce\xb1 and \xce\xb1-globin genes. This study is the first to establish the expression  profiles of PIPK genes during in vitro erythropoiesis in healthy  individuals and suggests a parallel between the expression of PIPK and globin  genes, reinforcing the hypothesis that they may be related. labels: #Globins'
b'The \xce\xb2-thalassemia syndromes reflect deficient or absent \xce\xb2-globin synthesis usually owing to a mutation in the \xce\xb2-globin locus. The relative excess of \xce\xb1-globin results in the formation of insoluble aggregates leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and shortened red cell survival. A relatively high capacity for fetal hemoglobin synthesis is a major genetic modifier of disease severity, with polymorphisms in other genes also having a significant role. Iron overload secondary to enhanced absorption and red cell transfusions causes an increase in liver iron and in various other tissues, leading to endocrine and cardiac dysfunction. Modern chelation regimens are effective in removing iron and preserving or restoring organ function. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), so named after its initial discovery in brain neurones, has received great attention as a result of its neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we demonstrated that, in neurones, Ngb is a 17\xce\xb2-oestradiol (E(2) ) inducible protein that is pivotal for hormone-induced anti-apoptotic effects against H(2) O(2)  toxicity. The involvement of Ngb in other brain cell populations, as well as in other neuroprotective effects of E(2) , is completely unknown at present. We demonstrate Ngb immunoreactivity in reactive astrocytes located in the proximity of a penetrating cortical injury in vivo and the involvement of Ngb in the E(2) -mediated anti-inflammatory effect in primary cortical astrocytes. Upon binding to oestrogen receptor (ER)\xce\xb2, E(2)  enhances Ngb levels in a dose-dependent manner. Although with a lesser degree than E(2) , the pro-inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also induces the increase of Ngb protein levels via nuclear factor-(NF)\xce\xbaB signal(s). Moreover, a negative cross-talk between ER subtypes and NF\xce\xbaB signal(s) has been demonstrated. In particular, ER\xce\xb1-activated signals prevent the NF\xce\xbaB-mediated Ngb increase, whereas LPS impairs the ER\xce\xb2-induced up-regulation of Ngb. Therefore, the co-expression of both ER\xce\xb1 and ER\xce\xb2 is pivotal for mediating E(2) -induced Ngb expression in the presence of NF\xce\xbaB-activated signals. Interestingly, Ngb silencing prevents the effect of E(2)  on the expression of inflammatory markers (i.e. interleukin 6 and interferon \xce\xb3-inducible protein 10). Ngb can be regarded as a key mediator of the different protective effects of E(2)  in the brain, including protection against oxidative stress and the control of inflammation, both of which are at the root of several neurodegenerative diseases. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) has been demonstrated to be a novel neuroprotective protein that protects against hypoxia/ischemia and oxidative stress-induced injury in the nervous system. However, the regulation mechanisms of Ngb gene expression under both normal resting and stress conditions have not been fully elucidated. The cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a key transcription factor that regulates a variety of pro-survival genes, but its role in regulating the neuroprotective gene Ngb has not been studied. In this study we investigated the transcriptional regulation of mouse Ngb gene by CREB in mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a. Our results showed that CREB knockdown decreased Ngb gene expression, and overexpression of the wild-type CREB, but not the mutant CREB, significantly increased Ngb gene expression in N2a cells. Moreover, a cAMP response element (CRE) site located at -854 in the promoter region of mouse Ngb gene was found to be responsible for both basal and CREB-induced Ngb promoter activity. Using chromatin immunopreciptation (ChIP) assays, we found that CREB could bind to the Ngb promoter region spanning from -1016 to -793 that harbors the CRE site. Taken together, our results suggested that transcription factor CREB participates in the transcriptional regulation of mouse Ngb gene. labels: #Globins'
b'Recent evidence suggests that limb ischemic preconditioning (LIP) protects neurons against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the mechanisms of LIP are not well understood. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered globin that affords protection against hypoxic/ischemic brain injury. This study was performed to investigate the role of Ngb in the neuroprotection of LIP against brain ischemia and the involvements of mitochondria in the process. The rat global brain ischemic model was used, and the CA1 hippocampus was selected as the observational target. Ngb expression was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot. Neuropathological evaluation was performed by thionin staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential (\xce\x94\xcf\x88m), Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, and ultrastructure were examined by flow cytometry, spectrophotometry, and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. We also used Ngb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) and Ngb inducer hemin to inhibit or mimic the effect of LIP. We found that LIP significantly up-regulated Ngb expression and protected neurons against ischemia. Furthermore, LIP effectively improved deterioration in the \xce\x94\xcf\x88m, mitochondrial Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, and ultrastructure induced by cerebral ischemia. These effects of LIP were inhibited partly by Ngb AS-ODNs and mimicked by hemin. It could be concluded that up-regulation of Ngb expression played an important role in the neuroprotection induced by LIP, and the Ngb-mediated neuroprotection of LIP was, at least partly, associated with mitochondria. labels: #Globins'
b'The different stunning methods for Atlantic salmon can still be improved with regard to animal welfare. Salmon exposed to carbon monoxide expressed no aversive reactions towards CO as such. CO exposed fish showed an earlier onset of rigour mortis and a faster decrease in muscle pH due to depletion of oxygen during the treatment. Exposure to CO did increase the level of cortisol compared to undisturbed control fish, but the increase was less than in the water only control group. Neuroglobin, a CO binding globin, was found in salmon brain and Saccus vasculosus, a richly vascularized sac connected to the fish brain. Binding of CO to neuroglobin during sedation might possibly improve animal welfare. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin belongs to the family of hexacoordinate hemoglobins and has been implicated in the protection of neuronal tissue under hypoxic and ischemic conditions. Here we present transient absorption and photoacoustic calorimetry studies of CO photodissociation and bimolecular rebinding to neuroglobin focusing on the ligand migration process and the role of distal pocket residues (His64 and Val68) and two Cys residues (Cys55 and Cys120). Our results indicate that His64 has a minor impact on the migration of CO between the distal heme pocket and protein exterior, whereas the Val68 side chain regulates the transition of the photodissociated ligand between the distal pocket and internal hydrophobic cavities, which is evident from the increased geminate quantum yield in this mutated protein (\xce\xa6(gem) = 0.32 for WT and His64Gln, and \xce\xa6(gem) = 0.85 for Val68Phe). The interface between helix G and the A-B loop provides an escape pathway for the photodissociated ligand, which is evident from a decrease in the reaction enthalpy for the transition between the CO-bound hNgb and five-coordinate hNgb in the Cys120Ser mutant (\xce\x94H = -3 \xc2\xb1 4 kcal mol(-1)) compared to that of the WT protein (\xce\x94H = 20 \xc2\xb1 4 kcal mol(-1)). The extensive electrostatic/hydrogen binding network that includes heme propionate groups, Lys67, His64, and Tyr44 not only restricts the heme binding but also modulates the energetics of binding of CO to the five-coordinate hNgb as substitution of His64 with Gln leads to an endothermic association of CO with the five-coordinate hNgb (\xce\x94H = 6 \xc2\xb1 3 kcal mol(-1)). labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin and cytoglobin are new members of the heme-globin family. Both globins are primarily expressed in neurons of the brain and retina. Neuroglobin and cytoglobin have been suggested as novel therapeutic targets in various neurodegenerative diseases based on their oxygen binding and cell protecting properties. However, findings in Neuroglobin-deficient mice question the endogenous neuroprotective properties. The expression pattern of neuroglobin and cytoglobin in the rodent brain is also in contradiction to a major role of neuronal protection. In a recent study, neuroglobin was ubiquitously expressed and up-regulated following stroke in the human brain. The present study aimed at confirming our previous observations in rodents using two post-mortem human brains. The anatomical localization of neuroglobin and cytoglobin in the human brain is much like what has been described for the rodent brain. Neuroglobin is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, amygdale and in the pontine tegmental nuclei, but not in the hippocampus. Cytoglobin is highly expressed in the habenula, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus and the pontine tegmental nuclei. We only detected a low expression of neuroglobin and cytoglobin in the cerebral cortex, while no expression in the cerebellar cortex was detectable. We provide a neuroanatomical indication for a different role of neuroglobin and cytoglobin in the human brain. labels: #Globins'
b'Peripheral whole blood is relatively easily obtained for monitoring gene expression for biomarker discovery using transcriptomic platforms such as genome-wide microarrays. However, whole blood provides challenges caused by sensitivity for ex\xc2\xa0vivo incubation and overrepresentation of globin mRNAs. We compared the performance of 2 commercial whole blood preservation methods, TEMPUS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and PAXgene (PreAnalytiX, Qiagen BD, Valencia, CA), using 2 RNA amplification protocols and high-density microarrays. Performance of commercial globin mRNA reduction protocol also was studied. Human peripheral blood samples collected with TEMPUS and PAXgene Blood RNA tubes were amplified with the RiboAmp OA 1 Round RNA Amplification Kit (Arcturus; Applied Biosystems) and the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) small sample protocol. Affymetrix globin reduction protocol was applied for total RNA samples. Samples amplified with RiboAmp were hybridized on Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) and subjected to statistical analyses. RiboAmp mRNA amplification did not notably amplify globin mRNA that is overrepresented in RNA isolated by both TEMPUS and PAXgene preservation. Enzymatic depletion of globin transcript reduced the quality of total RNA and is thus not recommendable. Microarray analysis showed acceptable correlation within and between the RNA preservation methods, but altogether 443 transcripts were differentially expressed between RNA samples preserved in TEMPUS and PAXgene tubes. We demonstrated that the 2 tested blood RNA-preservation methods combined with RiboAmp mRNA amplification may be used for microarray experiments without the need for a prior globin RNA reduction. However, because genes involved in immune cell functions and gene regulatory pathways were differentially expressed as a result of the technical bias between the preservation methods, they should not be used in the same analytic setting. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a globin present in the brain and retina of mammals. This hexacoordinated hemoprotein binds small diatomic molecules, albeit with lower affinity compared with other globins. Another distinctive feature of most mammalian Ngb is their ability to form an internal disulfide bridge that increases ligand affinity. As often seen for prosthetic heme b containing proteins, human Ngb exhibits heme heterogeneity with two alternative heme orientations within the heme pocket. To date, no details are available on the impact of heme orientation on the binding properties of human Ngb and its interplay with the cysteine oxidation state. In this work, we used (1)H NMR spectroscopy to probe the cyanide binding properties of different Ngb species in solution, including wild-type Ngb and the single (C120S) and triple (C46G/C55S/C120S) mutants. We demonstrate that in the disulfide-containing wild-type protein cyanide ligation is fivefold faster for one of the two heme orientations (the A isomer) compared with the other isomer, which is attributed to the lower stability of the distal His64-iron bond and reduced steric hindrance at the bottom of the cavity for heme sliding in the A conformer. We also attribute the slower cyanide reactivity in the absence of a disulfide bridge to the tighter histidine-iron bond. More generally, enhanced internal mobility in the CD loop bearing the disulfide bridge hinders access of the ligand to heme iron by stabilizing the histidine-iron bond. The functional impact of heme disorder and cysteine oxidation state on the properties of the Ngb ligand is discussed. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a hexacoordinated globin expressed mainly in the central and peripheral nervous system of vertebrates. Although several hypotheses have been put forward regarding the role of neuroglobin, its definite function remains uncertain. Ngb appears to have a neuro-protective role enhancing cell viability under hypoxia and other types of oxidative stress. Ngb is phylogenetically ancient and has a substitution rate nearly four times lower than that of other vertebrate globins, e.g. hemoglobin. Despite its high sequence conservation among vertebrates Ngb seems to be elusive in invertebrates.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined candidate orthologs in invertebrates and identified a globin of the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens that is most likely orthologous to vertebrate Ngb and confirmed the orthologous relationship of the polymeric globin of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to Ngb. The putative orthologous globin genes are located next to genes orthologous to vertebrate POMT2 similarly to localization of vertebrate Ngb. The shared syntenic position of the globins from Trichoplax, the sea urchin and of vertebrate Ngb strongly suggests that they are orthologous. A search for conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoter regions of the Ngb genes of different vertebrates via phylogenetic footprinting revealed several TFBSs, which may contribute to the specific expression of Ngb, whereas a comparative analysis with myoglobin revealed several common TFBSs, suggestive of regulatory mechanisms common to globin genes.SIGNIFICANCE: Identification of the placozoan and echinoderm genes orthologous to vertebrate neuroglobin strongly supports the hypothesis of the early evolutionary origin of this globin, as it shows that neuroglobin was already present in the placozoan-bilaterian last common ancestor. Computational determination of the transcription factor binding sites repertoire provides on the one hand a set of transcriptional factors that are responsible for the specific expression of the Ngb genes and on the other hand a set of factors potentially controlling expression of a couple of different globin genes. labels: #Globins'
b'Transcriptional corepressor ETO2 is a component of a protein complex containing master regulators of hematopoiesis, including GATA-1, SCL/TAL1, LMO2, and LDB1. To elucidate the role of ETO2 during erythroid differentiation, including the effects of ETO2 on GATA-1 targets, we performed gene expression profiling using K562 cells overexpressed with ETO2. The analysis demonstrated that 667 and 598 genes were upregulated and downregulated (more than twofold), respectively, in ETO2-overexpressing cells. ETO2-repressed genes included those encoding prototypical erythroid proteins. To test what percentages of ETO2-repressed genes could be direct target genes of GATA-1 in K562 cells, we merged the microarray results with ChIP-seq profile (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05,749), demonstrating that 23.1% of ETO2-repressed genes contained significant GATA-1 in their loci. However, there was no significant enrichment of PU.1 target genes among ETO2-repressed genes. Gene ontology analysis among ETO2-repressed genes revealed significant enrichment of genes related to "oxygen transporter," corresponding to globin genes. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and ETO2 knockdown analyses confirmed that ETO2 directly regulates globin genes in K562 cells. Next, we evaluated the role of ETO2 in human primary erythroblasts, derived from cord blood CD34-positive cells. In an ex\xc2\xa0vivo model of erythroid differentiation from CD34-positive cells, ETO2 protein level peaked at day 2-4 and almost diminished at the later stage of differentiation. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and retroviral vector-mediated overexpression of ETO2 in primary erythroblasts suggested that ETO2 significantly represses HBB, HBA, and ALAS2 expression. In summary, ETO2 regulates GATA-1 target genes critical for erythroid differentiation, and the decrease of ETO2 levels during erythroid differentiation would contribute to the activation of these targets. labels: #Globins'
b'Chromatin remodeling is essential for controlling the expression of genes during development. The histone-modifying enzyme G9a/KMT1C can act both as a coactivator and a corepressor of transcription. Here, we show that the dual function of G9a as a coactivator vs. a corepressor entails its association within two distinct protein complexes, one containing the coactivator Mediator and one containing the corepressor Jarid1a/KDM5A. Functionally, G9a is important in stabilizing the Mediator complex for gene activation, whereas its repressive function entails a coordinate action with the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase Jarid1a for the maintenance of gene repression. The essential nature of cross-talk between the histone methyltransferase G9a and the demethylase Jarid1a is demonstrated on the embryonic E(y)-globin gene, where the concurrent introduction of repressive histone marks (dimethylated H3K9 and dimethylated H3K27) and removal of activating histone mark (trimethylated H3K4) is required for maintenance of gene silencing. Taken together with our previous demonstration of cross-talk between UTX and MLL2 to mediate activation of the adult \xce\xb2(maj)-globin gene, these data suggest a model where "active" and "repressive" cross-talk between histone-modifying enzymes coexist on the same multigene locus and play a crucial role in the precise control of developmentally regulated gene expression. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Local recurrence in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) despite clear surgical margins may indicate the presence of residual, sub-microscopic disease. Molecular assessment of surgical margins may provide a greater prognostic sensitivity compared to histopathology. We aimed to determine whether promoter methylation in deep and mucosal resection margins can predict recurrence in OSCC.METHODS: Forty-eight consecutive OSCC cases were recruited and a 5\xc2\xa0mm(3) tumor sample plus 5 deep and 5 mucosal margin samples were snap frozen. Clinical, pathological, adjuvant therapy, and outcome data were recorded. Tumors were informative if>5\xc2\xa0% promoter methylation was found for \xe2\x89\xa51 of 4 genes using qMSP. Margins were declared molecularly positive if>1\xc2\xa0% promoter methylation was found in any margin.RESULTS: Thirty (63\xc2\xa0%) of 48 cases were methylation informative. Mucosal margin samples were largely positive for methylation (26 of 30, 87\xc2\xa0%), indicating the presence of field cancerization. Methylation at \xe2\x89\xa51 gene promoters in \xe2\x89\xa51 deep margin correlated with the presence of close/involved mucosal margins (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.027) and increased pT status (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.027) but not the status of deep margins, recurrence, or survival.CONCLUSIONS: The current gene panel did not add prognostic information to histopathological reporting of resection margins. Future efforts should concentrate on improving gene selection, informativity, and assay performance in the patient group with intermediate indications for adjuvant therapy. labels: #Globins'
b'Hypoxia inducible factor 1(HIF-1\xce\xb1) is the regulator of oxygen homeostasis in tissue correlated with neuroglobin (NGB) a member of the family of globins in vertebrates. The present study investigates, the expression and the location of NGB, HIF-1\xce\xb1 in human carotid bodies, sampled at autopsy from children (mean age: 2 year \xc2\xb1), young (mean age: 27.5) and 4 old subjects (mean age: 73.5). The percentage of NGB positive area was higher in the old subjects (4.4 \xc2\xb12.8%), as compared with the young ones (2.4 \xc2\xb11.8%) and children (1.0 \xc2\xb11.8%). Positive HIF-1\xce\xb1 nuclei were detected in young and old subjects (1.0 \xc2\xb10.14% vs 3.0 \xc2\xb10.28%, respectively), whereas CB tissues from children did not show any HIF-1\xce\xb1 reaction. The increase of NGB and HIF-1\xce\xb1 expression suggests a possible role of the two oxygen sensors in the aging processes. Even though the physiological role of NGB is not well understood, it could be suggested that is act as a respiratory protein connected with HIF. labels: #Globins'
b'PURPOSE: Different synthetic and natural biomaterials have been used in bone tissue regeneration. However, several limitations are associated with the use of synthetic as well as allogenous or xenogenous natural materials. This study evaluated, in an in vitro model, the behavior of rat osteoblastic cells cultured on a human globin scaffold.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat osteoblastic cells were isolated from the calvaria of 21-day-old fetal Sprague-Dawley rats. They were then grown in the presence of globin. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to study the expression of cyclin D1, integrin \xce\x921, Msx2, Dlx5, Runx2, and osteocalcin on days 1, 5, and 9. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase activity was measured on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Alizarin red staining was performed on day 9 to observe calcium deposition.RESULTS: Cells were able to adhere, proliferate, and differentiate on globin scaffolds. Moreover, RT-PCR showed that globin may stimulate some key genes of osteoblastic differentiation (Runx2, osteocalcin, Dlx5). Globin had an inhibitory effect on alkaline phosphatase activity. Calcium deposits were seen after 9 days of culture.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that purified human globin might be a suitable scaffold for bone tissue regeneration. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) exists only in small amounts in salmon brain. In order to study the protein in more detail salmon neuroglobin (sNgb) was cloned, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The protein had red color and showed the characteristic peaks at 411nm (metNgb), 415nm (carboxyNgb) and 424nm (deoxyNgb). Western analysis showed that sNgb reacted weakly against a rabbit anti human neuroglobin (hNgb) and strongly to a sNgb specific antibody. Our 3D-homology model of the sNgb indicated modifications adjacent to and in the O(2)/CO binding site. This may correlate to differences in substrate affinities for the sNgb compared to the hNgb. Also sNgb contained shorter helixes and longer interhelical loops typical for psychrophilic proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a member of the globin superfamily expressed in vertebrate brain and retina. The protein is thought to be involved in neuronal protection from hypoxia or oxidative stress and could represent a key element of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Our aim was to determine whether neuroglobin could be directly associated with mitochondrial metabolism and integrity. We identified three different forms of neuroglobin in the retina, varying in their apparent molecular masses; all forms are abundant in mitochondrial fractions. This indicates that a significant fraction of the protein localizes within the organelle either in the matrix or in the matrix side of the inner membrane. Since neuroglobin was especially abundant in the ganglion cell layer, we transduced retinal ganglion cells with an anti-neuroglobin short hairpin RNA using in vivo electroporation. Neuroglobin knockdown leads to reduced activities of respiratory chain complexes I and III, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, and impairment of visual function. The deleterious effect on cell survival was confirmed in primary retinal ganglion cells subjected to inhibition of neuroglobin expression. Hence, neuroglobin should be considered as a novel mitochondrial protein involved in respiratory chain function which is essential for retinal ganglion cell integrity. labels: #Globins'
b'Tibetan chicken (Gallus gallus) is a specific chicken breed with strong ability to resist hypoxia, especially during embryonic stage. Though this breed has lived in Tibet plateau for thousands of years, the adaptive mechanism in response to hypoxia is still unknown. In order to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of hypoxic adaptability in high altitude, we analyzed the mRNA expression pattern of globins in the present study. The fertilized eggs from Tibetan chicken and dwarf recessive white chicken breeds were incubated under normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (13% O2) conditions, equivalent to the altitude of 3600m. We observed that Tibetan chicken embryos had higher hatchability (48%) in hypoxia than their lowland controls (7.8%). Northern blot showed that globin mRNA expression in Tibetan chicken embryos differed greatly from lowland controls under hypoxia. The expressions of four dominant globin mRNAs, named \xce\xb1(A), \xce\xb1(D), \xce\xb2(A) and \xce\xb2(H), were significantly induced under hypoxia. Tibetan chicken embryos had lower globin mRNA level in red cells than that of lowland controls at day 19 (P<0.05). Based on real-time PCR the same result was confirmed. Furthermore, we observed accumulation of globins induced by hypoxia in red cells by performing the separation of globin analysis, showing higher level of globins in red cells of Tibetan chicken embryos than that of lowland chicken embryos. Overall, our results provide new evidence that flexible regulation of globins at the level of transcription and translation may play a role in allowing the Tibetan chicken embryo to resist hypoxia. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the role of neuroglobin (Ngb) in the pathologic process of contusion and laceration of brain in children.METHODS: The proteins in the brain tissue were extracted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in 3 children undergoing brain ventricular neoplasms resection (normal brain tissue) and in 8 children with contusion and laceration of brain. The image analysis was done using the PDQuest 7.0 software. The differential protein spots were detected and analyzed with Applied Biosystems Voyager System 4307 MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer and bioinformatical skills. Ngb expression in the brain tissue was measured using immunohistochemisty. Ngb expression in plasma was measured using ELISA in 15 children with contusion and laceration of brain and 10 healthy children.RESULTS: Expression maps of the brain tissue were established by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in children with contusion and laceration of brain and healthy children. Six differential protein spots were found and 5 of them were identified by mass spectrum. Immunohistochemisty assay showed that Ngb expression in the brain tissue in children with contusion and laceration of brain was significantly higher than in normal controls (P<0.05). ELISA results showed that Ngb expression in the plasma increased significantly 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours after trauma in children with contusion and laceration of brain compared with healthy children (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Ngb may play an important role in the pathologic process of contusion and laceration of brain in children. labels: #Globins'
b'We have studied the binding of carbon monoxide (CO) in mutants of Cyt c having its methionine at position 80 replaced by alanine, aspartate, and arginine, so that the sixth coordination is available for ligand binding. We have employed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) photolysis difference spectroscopy to examine interactions of the heme-bound and photolyzed CO (and also nitric oxide, NO) in the small heme pocket created by the mutations. By using FTIR temperature derivative spectroscopy (TDS) and nanosecond flash photolysis, the enthalpy barrier distributions for CO rebinding were determined. In flash photolysis experiments, the majority of ligands rebind to the heme iron on picosecond time scales so that only the high-barrier tail of the distributions is visible on the nanosecond scale. By continuous wave excitation prior to TDS characterization of the barriers, however, each Cyt c molecule is photoexcited multiple times and complete photodissociation can be achieved, which likely arises from a rotation of the CO within the heme pocket so that the oxygen faces the heme iron. Apparently, reorientation prior to rebinding constitutes an additional and significant contribution to the rebinding barrier. Our experiments reveal that the compact, rigid structure of Cyt c offers no alternative binding sites for photodissociated ligands in the protein matrix. A comparison of ligand binding in these Cyt c mutants and hemoglobins underscores the importance of internal ligand docking sites and ligand migration routes for conveying a ligand binding function to heme proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'3D nanostructured transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes prepared by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) were used for the spectroelectrochemical characterization of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and neuroglobin (Nb). These small hemoproteins, involved as electron-transfer partners in the prevention of apoptosis, are oppositely charged at physiological pH and can each be adsorbed within the ITO network under different pH conditions. The resulting modified electrodes were investigated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy coupled with cyclic voltammetry. By using nondenaturating adsorption conditions, we demonstrate that both proteins are capable of direct electron transfer to the conductive ITO surface, sharing apparent standard potentials similar to those reported in solution. Preservation of the 3D protein structure upon adsorption was confirmed by resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy. Analysis of the derivative cyclic voltabsorptograms (DCVA) monitored either in the Soret or the Q bands at scan rates up to 1 V s(-1) allowed us to investigate direct interfacial electron transfer kinetics. From the DCVA shape and scan rate dependences, we conclude that the interaction of Cyt c with the ITO surface is more specific than Nb, suggesting an oriented adsorption of Cyt c and a random adsorption of Nb on the ITO surface. At the same time, Cyt c appears more sensitive to the experimental adsorption conditions, and complete denaturation of Cyt c may occur as evidenced from cross-correlation of rR spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. labels: #Globins'
b'Although the specific functions of sleep have not been completely elucidated, the literature has suggested that sleep is essential for proper homeostasis. Sleep loss is associated with changes in behavioral, neurochemical, cellular, and metabolic function as well as impaired immune response. Using high-resolution microarrays we evaluated the gene expression profiles of healthy male volunteers who underwent 60 h of prolonged wakefulness (PW) followed by 12 h of sleep recovery (SR). Peripheral whole blood was collected at 8 am in the morning before the initiation of PW (Baseline), after the second night of PW, and one night after SR. We identified over 500 genes that were differentially expressed. Notably, these genes were related to DNA damage and repair and stress response, as well as diverse immune system responses, such as natural killer pathways including killer cell lectin-like receptors family, as well as granzymes and T-cell receptors, which play important roles in host defense. These results support the idea that sleep loss can lead to alterations in molecular processes that result in perturbation of cellular immunity, induction of inflammatory responses, and homeostatic imbalance. Moreover, expression of multiple genes was downregulated following PW and upregulated after SR compared with PW, suggesting an attempt of the body to re-establish internal homeostasis. In silico validation of alterations in the expression of CETN3, DNAJC, and CEACAM genes confirmed previous findings related to the molecular effects of sleep deprivation. Thus, the present findings confirm that the effects of sleep loss are not restricted to the brain and can occur intensely in peripheral tissues. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a recently discovered cytoplasmic heme-binding globin. Although multiple hemeproteins have been reported to function as nitrite reductases in mammalian cells, it is unknown whether Cygb can also reduce nitrite to nitric oxide (NO). The mechanism, magnitude, and quantitative importance of Cygb-mediated nitrite reduction in tissues have not been reported. To investigate this pathway and its quantitative importance, EPR spectroscopy, spectrophotometric measurements, and chemiluminescence NO analyzer studies were performed. Under anaerobic conditions, mixing nitrite with ferrous-Cygb triggered NO formation that was trapped and detected using EPR spin trapping. Spectrophotometric studies revealed that nitrite binding to ferrous-Cygb is followed by formation of ferric-Cygb and NO. The kinetics and magnitude of Cygb-mediated NO formation were characterized. It was observed that Cygb-mediated NO generation increased linearly with the increase of nitrite concentration under anaerobic conditions. This Cygb-mediated NO production greatly increased with acidosis and near-anoxia as occur in ischemic conditions. With the addition of nitrite, soluble guanylyl cyclase activation was significantly higher in normal smooth muscle cells compared with Cygb knocked down cells with Cygb accounting for \xe2\x88\xbc40% of the activation in control cells and \xe2\x88\xbc60% in cells subjected to hypoxia for 48 h. Overall, these studies show that Cygb-mediated nitrite reduction can play an important role in NO generation and soluble guanylyl cyclase activation under hypoxic conditions, with this process regulated by pH, oxygen tension, nitrite concentration, and the redox state of the cells. labels: #Globins'
b'Arsenic (As) in drinking water is a toxicant causing several health problems including nervous system disturbance. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a tissue globin in nervous system playing protective role against oxidative stress in many injuries. This study was to investigate how long arsenite exposure (sodium arsenite 7.5 mg/kg/day) could induce oxidative stress in blood and brain of rats and to determine whether Ngb expression in rat brain changed due to oxidative stress. Results showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in serum and brain homogenates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in red blood cells (RBCs) did not change in the rats exposed to arsenite for 8 weeks. In the rats exposed to arsenite for 16 weeks, SOD activity decreased (serum: P<0.05; brain homogenates: P<0.01) and MDA level increased (P<0.01) in serum and brain homogenates; ROS production increased (P<0.01) in RBC. When oxidative stress occurred, Ngb mRNA expression did not change in whole brain, cerebral cortex, midbrain, and hippocampus; however, Ngb mRNA expression increased significantly (P<0.05) in cerebellum compared to the control group. This study suggests that arsenite exposure for 16 weeks can lead to oxidative stress of blood and brain of rats. Ngb may play a protective role in cerebellum when oxidative stress occurs due to arsenite exposure. labels: #Globins'
b'Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments reveal a significant difference between the principal g values (and hence ligand-field parameters) of the ferric cyanide-ligated form of different variants of the protoglobin of Methanosarcina acetivorans (MaPgb) and of horse heart myoglobin (hhMb). The largest principal g value of the ferric cyanide-ligated MaPgb variants is found to be significantly lower than for any of the other globins reported so far. This is at least partially caused by the strong heme distortions as proven by the determination of the hyperfine interaction of the heme nitrogens and mesoprotons. Furthermore, the experiments confirm recent theoretical predictions [Forti, F.; Boechi, L., Bikiel, D., Mart\xc3\xad, M.A.; Nardini, M.; Bolognesi, M.; Viappiani, C.; Estrin, D.; Luque, F. J. J. Phys. Chem. B 2011, 115, 13771-13780] that Phe(G8)145 plays a crucial role in the ligand modulation in MaPgb. Finally, the influence of the N-terminal 20 amino-acid chain on the heme pocket in these protoglobins is also proven. labels: #Globins'
b'Although many physiological adaptations of diving mammals have been reported, little is known about how their brains sustain the high demands for metabolic energy and thus O(2) when submerged. A recent study revealed in the deep-diving hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) a unique shift of the oxidative energy metabolism and neuroglobin, a respiratory protein that is involved in neuronal hypoxia tolerance, from neurons to astrocytes. Here we have investigated neuroglobin in another pinniped species, the harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), and in two cetaceans, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Neuroglobin sequences, expression levels and patterns were compared with those of terrestrial relatives, the ferret (Mustela putorius furo) and the cattle (Bos taurus), respectively. Neuroglobin sequences of whales and seals only differ in two or three amino acids from those of cattle and ferret, and are unlikely to confer functional differences, e.g. in O(2) affinity. Neuroglobin is expressed in the astrocytes also of P. groenlandicus, suggesting that the shift of neuroglobin and oxidative metabolism is a common adaptation in the brains of deep-diving phocid seals. In the cetacean brain neuroglobin resides in neurons, like in terrestrial mammals. However, neuroglobin mRNA expression levels were 4-15 times higher in the brains of harbor porpoises and minke whales than in terrestrial mammals or in seals. Thus neuroglobin appears to play a specific role in diving mammals, but seals and whales have evolved divergent strategies to cope with cerebral hypoxia. The specific function of neuroglobin that conveys hypoxia tolerance may either relate to oxygen supply or protection from reactive oxygen species. The different strategies in seals and whales resulted from a divergent evolution and an independent adaptation to diving. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: The activation of hepatic stellate cells plays a central role in the development of liver fibrosis during chronic liver trauma. The aim of the present study was to identify a compound that inhibits the activation process of stellate cells.METHODS: Rat primary cultured stellate cells and a human stellate cell line (LX-2) were used. The effects of arundic acid on the expression of \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin, collagen 1\xce\xb11, and cytoglobin were evaluated.RESULTS: Arundic acid (300 \xce\xbcM) inhibited the activation of primary rat stellate cells, as determined by morphological transformation and \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin expression, after both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. The level of \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin mRNA showed a dose-dependent decrease in response to arundic acid, and 50 \xce\xbcM arundic acid exhibited the maximum inhibition of collagen 1\xce\xb11 mRNA expression. In contrast, arundic acid triggered an unexpected increase in mRNA and protein levels of cytoglobin, the fourth globin in mammals expressed exclusively in hepatic stellate cells. The effect of arundic acid on the level of \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin mRNA was abrogated in HSCs treated with cytoglobin siRNA. Arundic acid decreased the expression of collagen 1\xce\xb11 mRNA in LX-2 cells.CONCLUSION: Arundic acid affects the activation process of hepatic stellate cells via the unexpected induction of cytoglobin. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb), a neuronal specific oxygen binding heme-globin, reported to be expressed at high levels in most layers of the murine retina. Ngb's function is presently unknown, but based on its high expression level and oxygen binding capabilities Ngb was proposed to function as an oxygen reservoir facilitating oxygen metabolism in highly active neurons or to function as a neuroprotectant. In the present study, we re-examined the expression pattern of Ngb in the retina using a highly validated antibody. Furthermore, intactness of retino-hypothalamic projections and the retinal expression level of Melanopsin and Tyrosine Hydroxylase were investigated in Ngb-null mice. Ngb-immunoreactivity was found in a few neurons of the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers co-expressing Melanopsin and Tyrosine Hydroxylase, respectively. Ngb deficiency neither affected the level of Melanopsin and Tyrosine Hydroxylase proteins nor the intactness of PACAP-positive retinohypothalamic projections in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Based on the present results, it seems unlikely that Ngb could have a major role in retinal oxygen homeostasis and neuronal survival under normal conditions. The present study suggests that a number of previously published reports have relied on antibodies with dubious specificity. labels: #Globins"
b'The microaerophilic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni possesses inducible systems for resisting NO. Two globins--Cgb (a single-domain globin) and Ctb (a truncated globin)--are up-regulated in response to NO via the positively acting transcription factor NssR. Our aims were to determine whether these oxygen-binding globins also function in severely oxygen-limited environments, as in the host. At growth-limiting oxygen transfer rates, bacteria were more S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) sensitive, irrespective of the presence of Cgb, Ctb, or NssR. Pregrowth of cells with GSNO enhanced GSNO resistance, even in nssR and cgb mutants, but transcriptomic profiling of oxygen-limited, NO-exposed cells failed to reveal the NssR regulon. Nevertheless, globin expression in an Escherichia coli mutant lacking the NO-detoxifying flavohemoglobin Hmp showed that Cgb and Ctb consume NO aerobically or anoxically and offer some protection to respiratory inhibition by NO. The constitutively expressed nitrite reductase NrfA does not provide resistance under oxygen-limited conditions. We, therefore, hypothesize that, although Cgb and NrfA can detoxify NO, even anoxically, they are neither up-regulated nor functional under physiologically relevant oxygen-limited conditions and, second, responses to NO do not stem from trancriptional regulation. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin is a hypoxia-inducible O(2)-binding protein with neuroprotective effects in cell and animal models of stroke and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism underlying neuroglobin's cytoprotective action is unknown, although several possibilities have been proposed, including anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry methods to identify neuroglobin-interacting proteins in normoxic and hypoxic murine neuronal (HN33) cell lysates, and to compare these interactions with those of a structurally and functionally related protein, myoglobin. We report that the protein interactomes of neuroglobin and myoglobin overlap substantially and are modified by hypoxia. In addition, neuroglobin-interacting proteins include partners consistent with both anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic functions, as well as with a relationship to several neurodegenerative diseases. labels: #Globins"
b'Mammalian neuroglobin (Ngb) protects neuronal cells under conditions of oxidative stress. The mechanism underlying this function is only partly understood. Here, we report that human Ngb exists in lipid rafts only during oxidative stress and that lipid rafts are crucial for neuroprotection by Ngb. The ferrous oxygen-bound form of Ngb, which exists under normoxia, is converted to the ferric bis-His conformation during oxidative stress, inducing large tertiary structural changes. We clarified that ferric bis-His Ngb, but not ferrous ligand-bound Ngb, specifically binds to flotillin-1, a lipid raft microdomain-associated protein, as well as to \xce\xb1-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (G\xce\xb1(i/o)). Moreover, we found that human ferric bis-His Ngb acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for G\xce\xb1(i/o) that has been modified by oxidative stress. In addition, our data shows that Ngb inhibits the decrease in cAMP concentration that occurs under oxidative stress, leading to protection against cell death. Furthermore, by using a mutated Ngb protein that cannot form the bis-His conformation, we demonstrate that the oxidative stress-induced structural changes of human Ngb are essential for its neuroprotective activity. labels: #Globins'
b'INTRODUCTION: Thalassemia and iron deficiency may both result in hypochromic microcytic anemia. Hematological algorithms that differentiate the two are mainly established in adult selected diagnostic groups. We aimed at creating an algorithm applicable in the presence of children, hemoglobin variants, and iron deficiency.METHODS: Our study material constituted blood samples referred during 1\xc2\xa0year for routine diagnostics of hemoglobinopathy. We included 443 samples, of which 37% were from children 3\xc2\xa0months or older. We found \xce\xb2-thalassemia trait (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0100), \xce\xb1-thalassemia (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa075), combined \xce\xb1-/\xce\xb2-thalassemia (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa014), hemoglobin variants (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa042), and no-hemoglobinopathy (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0207), of whom 107 had a ferritin at or below 20\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/L. We included reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, ferritin, and erythrocyte count in our algorithm.RESULTS: Our algorithm differentiated \xce\xb2-thalassemia trait from no-hemoglobinopathy with a sensitivity of 99% at 83% specificity. It performed better than other published algorithms when applied to all patient samples, while equally or moderately better in the 63% adult samples. Our algorithm also detected the clinically significant \xce\xb1-thalassemias, and most of the combined \xce\xb1-/\xce\xb2-thalassemias and thalassemic hemoglobin variants.CONCLUSION: Our algorithm efficiently differentiated thalassemia and thalassemic hemoglobin variants from iron deficiency in children and adults. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin, a new member of the mammalian heme-globin family has been shown to bind oxygen and to have cell protective properties in vitro. Cytoglobin is specifically expressed in a subpopulation of brain neurons. Based on hypoxia-induced up regulation and proposed scavenging of reactive oxygen species Cytoglobin was suggested as a candidate for pharmaceutical stroke treatment. Since production of reactive oxygen species is a hallmark of ischemia, we hypothesized that Cytoglobin expression would be increased and that Cytoglobin expressing neurons would be spared after ischemic injury. Twenty male C57BL/6J mice were used in the experimental design. Ten were sham operated and ten were given permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). All animals were euthanized after 24h. From each group, three animals were used for histology and seven for QRT-PCR and western blotting. Immunohistochemical examination of the ischemic penumbra revealed neither changes in Cytoglobin immunoreactivity nor any changes in expression in the necrotic infarct area. The lack of expression change was confirmed by western blotting and QRT-PCR showing no significant difference between sham and pMCAo operated mice. This suggests that Cytoglobin is likely not important for global neuronal protection following ischemia and the role of Cytoglobin in relation to endogenous neuroprotection remains unresolved. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Transcriptomic studies in clinical research are essential tools for deciphering the functional elements of the genome and unraveling underlying disease mechanisms. Various technologies have been developed to deduce and quantify the transcriptome including hybridization and sequencing-based approaches. Recently, high density exon microarrays have been successfully employed for detecting differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing events for biomarker discovery and disease diagnostics. The field of transcriptomics is currently being revolutionized by high throughput DNA sequencing methodologies to map, characterize, and quantify the transcriptome.METHODS: In an effort to understand the merits and limitations of each of these tools, we undertook a study of the transcriptome in sickle cell disease, a monogenic disease comparing the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarray (Exon array) and Illumina's deep sequencing technology (RNA-seq) on whole blood clinical specimens.RESULTS: Analysis indicated a strong concordance (R = 0.64) between Exon array and RNA-seq data at both gene level and exon level transcript expression. The magnitude of differential expression was found to be generally higher in RNA-seq than in the Exon microarrays. We also demonstrate for the first time the ability of RNA-seq technology to discover novel transcript variants and differential expression in previously unannotated genomic regions in sickle cell disease. In addition to detecting expression level changes, RNA-seq technology was also able to identify sequence variation in the expressed transcripts.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microarrays remain useful and accurate for transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples with low input requirements, while RNA-seq technology complements and extends microarray measurements for novel discoveries. labels: #Globins"
b'Increasing evidence points to endoglin (Eng), an accessory receptor for the transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2 superfamily commonly associated with the endothelial lineage, as an important regulator of the hematopoietic lineage. We have shown that lack of Eng results in reduced numbers of primitive erythroid colonies as well as downregulation of key hematopoietic genes. To determine the effect of Eng overexpression in hematopoietic development, we generated a doxycycline-inducible embryonic stem cell line. Our results demonstrate that induction of Eng during embryoid body differentiation leads to a significant increase in the frequency of hematopoietic progenitors, in particular, the erythroid lineage, which correlated with upregulation of Scl, Gata1, Runx1, and embryonic globin. Interestingly, activation of the hematopoietic program happened at the expense of endothelial and cardiac cells, as differentiation into these mesoderm lineages was compromised. Eng-induced enhanced erythroid activity was accompanied by high levels of Smad1 phosphorylation. This effect was attenuated by addition of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling inhibitor to these cultures. Among the BMPs, BMP4 is well known for its role in hematopoietic specification from mesoderm by promoting expression of several hematopoietic genes, including Scl. Because Scl is considered the master regulator of the hematopoietic program, we investigated whether Scl would be capable of rescuing the defective hematopoietic phenotype observed in Eng(-/-) embryonic stem cells. Scl expression in Eng-deficient embryonic stem cells resulted in increased erythroid colony-forming activity and upregulation of Gata1 and Gata2, positioning Eng upstream of Scl. Taken together, these findings support the premise that Eng modulates the hematopoietic transcriptional network, most likely through regulation of BMP4 signaling. labels: #Globins'
b'Proteins of the (hemo-)globin superfamily have been identified in many different animals but also occur in plants, fungi, and bacteria. Globins are renowned for their ability to store and to transport oxygen, but additional globin functions such as sensing, signaling, and detoxification have been proposed. Recently, we found that the zebrafish globin X protein is myristoylated and palmitoylated at its N-terminus. The addition of fatty acids results in an association with the cellular membranes, suggesting a previously unrecognized globin function. In this study, we show that N-terminal acylation likely occurs in globin proteins from a broad range of phyla. An N-terminal myristoylation site was identified in 90 nonredundant globins from Chlorophyta, Heterokontophyta, Cnidaria, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Nematoda, Echinodermata, Hemichordata, and Chordata (including Cephalochordata), of which 66 proteins carry an additional palmitoylation site. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses identified five major globin families, which may mirror the ancient globin diversity of the Metazoa. Globin X-like proteins form two related clades, which diverged before the radiation of the Eumetazoa. Vertebrate hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, cytoglobin, globin E, and globin Y form a strongly supported common clade, which is the sister group of a clade consisting of invertebrate Hbs and relatives. The N-terminally acylated globins do not form a single monophyletic group but are distributed to four distinct clades. This pattern may be either explained by multiple introduction of an N-terminal acylation site into distinct globin lineages or by the origin of animal respiratory globins from a membrane-bound ancestor. Similarly, respiratory globins were not monophyletic. This suggests that respiratory globins might have emerged independently several times and that the early metazoan globins might have been associated with a membrane and carried out a function that was related to lipid protection or signaling. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of Neuroglobin (Ngb) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries. In this study we tested the neuroprotective effects of Ngb over-expression against traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice.RESULTS: Both Ngb over-expression transgenic (Ngb-Tg) and wild-type (WT) control mice were subjected to TBI induced by a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device. TBI significantly increased Ngb expression in the brains of both WT and Ngb-Tg mice, but Ngb-Tg mice had significantly higher Ngb protein levels at the pre-injury baseline and post-TBI. Production of oxidative tissue damage biomarker 3NT in the brain was significantly reduced in Ngb-Tg mice compared to WT controls at 6 hours after TBI. The traumatic brain lesion volume was significantly reduced in Ngb Tg mice compared to WT mice at 3 weeks after TBI; however, there were no significant differences in the recovery of sensorimotor and spatial memory functional deficits between Ngb-Tg and WT control mice for up to 3 weeks after TBI.CONCLUSION: Ngb over-expression reduced traumatic lesion volume, which might partially be achieved by decreasing oxidative stress. labels: #Globins'
b'This study was performed to investigate the hypothesis that the erythroid micro-environment plays a role in regulation of globin gene expression during adult erythroid differentiation. Adult baboon bone marrow and human cord blood CD34+ progenitors were grown in methylcellulose, liquid media, and in co-culture with stromal cell lines derived from different developmental stages in identical media supporting erythroid differentiation to examine the effect of the micro-environment on globin gene expression. Adult progenitors express high levels of \xce\xb3-globin in liquid and methylcellulose media but low, physiological levels in stromal cell co-cultures. In contrast, \xce\xb3-globin expression remained high in cord blood progenitors in stromal cell line co-cultures. Differences in \xce\xb3-globin gene expression between adult progenitors in stromal cell line co-cultures and liquid media required cell-cell contact and were associated with differences in rate of differentiation and \xce\xb3-globin promoter DNA methylation. We conclude that \xce\xb3-globin expression in adult-derived erythroid cells can be influenced by the micro-environment, suggesting new potential targets for HbF induction. labels: #Globins'
b'PURPOSE: The impact of different severities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cognition has not well been documented. Neuroglobin, a recently discovered vertebrate protein, shows a neuroprotective function to modulate hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This study investigated the cognitive function of patients with varying OSA severities and intended to explore the relationship between levels of neuroglobin in serum and cognitive deficits of OSA.METHODS: Sixty Chinese adults aged 18-59 years old were enrolled and categorized into four groups based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): primary snoring (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x897), mild (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8913), moderate (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920), and severe (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920) OSA groups. Computer-based neurocognitive tests (including calculation, memory, and attention) and Epworth sleepiness scale were administered before polysomnographic monitoring, and blood sample was taken the next morning. Concentrations of serum neuroglobin were measured using ELISA.RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in cognitive function regardless of OSA severities, but patients with moderate and severe OSA presented significantly more sleepiness than patients with primary snoring and mild OSA. Memory significantly correlated with time spent with oxygen saturation below 90 % during nighttime (T\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x8990 %), as well as oxygen desaturation index, AHI, or NREM sleep. Calculation correlated significantly with sleepiness and respiratory arousal index. Levels of neuroglobin in serum of patients with varying OSA severities were significant elevated than that of patients with primary snoring. No relationship was found between the neurobehavioral ability index of neurocognitive tests and serum neuroglobin concentrations after controlling for gender, age, and BMI, whereas the unique association between levels of neuroglobin in serum and the scores of auditory digit span test was noted.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that different neurocognitive domains might specifically correlate to either sleepiness or hypoxemia. Changes of concentrations of neuroglobin in serum may possibly be used as an indicator to monitor the brain damage of OSA. Further investigations are needed to explore the relationship between regulation of neuroglobin in serum and severity of brain damage in OSA. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate rat neuroglobin (rNGB) expression level after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and further study its neuroprotective effects in TBI when it was overexpressed in adenoviral vector.METHODS: The Wistar rats (280-320  g) were divided into control, 12 and 36 hours after TBI groups (n = 3) and their TBI model was established. Subsequently, NGB expression level was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical. Beyond that, adenoviral vectors pAdEasy-rNGB-GFP and pAdEasy-GFP  were constructed and transfected into the rat brain respectively (pAdEasy-GFP was control), and the neuroprotective effects were examined by immunohistochemical.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and Western blot results demonstrated that NGB expression level was increased at 12  and 36 hours after TBI injury compare with control. Meanwhile, the pAdEasy-rNGB-GFP transfected rats suffered less necrosis and apoptosis compare to control.CONCLUSIONS: NGB was upregulated in TBI and overexpressed rNGB had a significant neuroprotection in TBI. However,  the mechanism remained unknown. This study suggested that rNGB overexpression may be a new strategy for treating of TBI. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a new member of the globin family and a novel endogenous neuroprotective molecule, but its neuroprotective mechanisms remain largely undefined. Previous studies suggest Ngb is both physically and functionally related to mitochondria, however without direct evidence. Our recent discovery has shown that Ngb can physically interact with a number of mitochondrial proteins. In this study we aimed to define the physical interaction between Ngb and mitochondria by determining whether there is a mitochondrial distribution of Ngb under both physiological-resting and pathological oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. Western blot for the first time revealed a small portion of Ngb was physically localized in mitochondria, and the relative mitochondrial Ngb level was significantly increased after OGD in primary-cultured mouse cortical neurons, indicating a translocation of Ngb into mitochondria. Complementary approaches including confocal imaging and immuno-electron microscopy confirmed Ngb distribution in mitochondria under both basal-resting condition and OGD. Inhibitors of mitochondria permeability transition pore (mPTP) and Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) blocked OGD-induced increase of mitochondrial Ngb level, demonstrating a possible role of mPTP in Ngb's mitochondrial translocation. We further found that Ngb overexpression-conferred neuroprotection was correlated with increased mitochondrial Ngb level, suggesting the mitochondria distribution of Ngb is clearly associated with and may contribute to Ngb's neuroprotection. labels: #Globins"
b'We have generated the Lys67Glu mutant form of neuroglobin. Experimental spectral studies are consistent with a six coordinate heme in which the distal histidine bond is stretched compared to the wild type protein. Carbon monoxide binding to the ferrous form of the mutant follows a hyperbolic concentration dependence limiting at the histidine dissociation rate of 0.7 s(-1). Further analysis indicates a significantly lowered histidine binding constant. Oxygen binding kinetic studies confirm the higher heme ligand dissociation level and indicate a p50 value for oxygen binding<1 mmHg. The ferrous form of the protein yields an oxygenated intermediate on reaction with oxygen. The rate of oxidation, by oxygen, follows a complex concentration dependence, consistent with the presence of two distinct oxidation mechanisms. A quantitative model for the two oxidation processes has been developed, which is consistent with a lowered distal histidine binding constant in the mutant form of the protein. These data suggest that the protein structure surrounding the heme site in neuroglobin limits access to external ligands and provides an energy barrier to the structural changes following ligand binding in this protein. However, the mutation does not appear to affect reactivity with cytochrome c and the anti-apoptotic activity of the mutant in human cells of neuronal origin is increased as compared to the wild type protein. labels: #Globins'
b'Carbonic anhydrase 1 (Car1), an early specific marker of the erythroid differentiation, has been used to distinguish fetal and adult erythroid cells since its production closely follows the \xce\xb3- to \xce\xb2-globin transition, but the molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of Car1 is unclear. Here, we show that Car1 mRNA decreases significantly when erythroid differentiation is induced in MEL cells. The Ldb1 protein complex including GATA1/SCL/LMO2 binds to the Car1 promoter in uninduced cells and reduced enrichment of the complex during differentiation correlates with loss of Car1 expression. Knockdown of Ldb1 results in a reduction of Ser2 phosphorylated RNA Pol II and Cdk9 at the Car1 promoter region, suggesting that Ldb1 is required for recruitment of Pol II as well as the transcription regulator P-TEFb to enhance elongation of Car1 transcripts. Taken together, these data show that Ldb1 forms a regulatory complex to maintain Car1 expression in erythroid cells. labels: #Globins'
b'Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neuroglobin (Ngb) participate in neuronal responses to hypoxia and ischemia, but the relationship between their effects, if any, is unknown. To address this issue, we measured Ngb levels in VEGF-treated mouse cerebrocortical cultures and VEGF levels in cerebrocortical cultures from Ngb-overexpressing transgenic mice. VEGF stimulated Ngb expression in a VEGFR2/Flk1 receptor-dependent manner, whereas Ngb overexpression suppressed expression of VEGF. These findings provide further insight into hypoxia-stimulated neuronal signaling pathways. labels: #Globins'
b'The endogenous vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) is metabolized in tissues in an O(2)-dependent manner. This regulates NO levels in the vascular wall; however, the underlying molecular basis of this O(2)-dependent NO consumption remains unclear. While cytoglobin (Cygb) was discovered a decade ago, its physiological function remains uncertain. Cygb is expressed in the vascular wall and can consume NO in an O(2)-dependent manner. Therefore, we characterize the process of the O(2)-dependent consumption of NO by Cygb in the presence of the cellular reductants and reducing systems ascorbate (Asc) and cytochrome P(450) reductase (CPR), measure rate constants of Cygb reduction by Asc and CPR, and propose a reaction mechanism and derive a related kinetic model for this O(2)-dependent NO consumption involving Cygb(Fe(3+)) as the main intermediate reduced back to ferrous Cygb by cellular reductants. This kinetic model expresses the relationship between the rate of O(2)-dependent consumption of NO by Cygb and rate constants of the molecular reactions involved. The predicted rate of O(2)-dependent consumption of NO by Cygb is consistent with experimental results supporting the validity of the kinetic model. Simulations based on this kinetic model suggest that the high efficiency of Cygb in regulating the NO consumption rate is due to the rapid reduction of Cygb by cellular reductants, which greatly increases the rate of consumption of NO at higher O(2) concentrations, and binding of NO to Cygb, which reduces the rate of consumption of NO at lower O(2) concentrations. Thus, the coexistence of Cygb with efficient reductants in tissues allows Cygb to function as an O(2)-dependent regulator of NO decay. labels: #Globins'
b'Among endogenous adaptive systems to hypoxia, neuroglobin, a recently discovered heme protein, was suggested as a novel oxygen-dependent neuroprotectant. We aimed to characterize i) maturational age-related regulation of neuroglobin in the developing mouse brain under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and ii) the role of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) as possible mediators of O(2)-dependent regulation of neuroglobin in vitro and in vivo. During early stages of postnatal brain maturation (P0-P14) neuroglobin mRNA levels significantly increased in developing mouse forebrains. By immunohistochemical analysis we confirmed expression of neuroglobin protein in the cytoplasm of developing neurons but not glial cells under normoxic conditions. Exposure of the immature brains (P0, P7) to acute (8% O(2), 6h) and chronic systemic hypoxia (10% O(2), 7 days) led to differential activation of neuroglobin varying with maturational stage (P0, P7) and severity of hypoxia. This observation may indicate that neuroglobin is involved in adaptive responses of immature neurons to acute hypoxia during an early stage of mouse brain maturation (P0). In response to activation of the HIF system by prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor (FG-4497), neuroglobin mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in primary mouse cortical neurons (DIV6) exposed to normoxia and hypoxia (1% O(2)) compared to non-treated controls. In conclusion, present results strongly indicate that cerebral regulation of neuroglobin is related to maturational stage and that hypoxia-induced neuroglobin up-regulation is modified by the HIF system. labels: #Globins'
b'For definitive diagnosis of thalassemia carriers and patients, as well as for prenatal diagnosis, genotype analysis is of fundamental importance. We report a dry-reagent, lateral flow dipstick test that enables visual genotyping (detection by naked eye) of 15 mutations common in Mediterranean populations in the beta-globin gene (HBB). The method comprises 3 simple steps: (i) PCR amplification of a single 1896 bp segment of the beta globin gene flanking all 15 mutations; (ii) a multiplex (10-plex and/or 30-plex) primer extension reaction of the unpurified amplification product using allele-specific primers. Biotin is incorporated in the extended product; (iii) a dry-reagent multi-allele (10-plex) dipstick assay for visual detection of the primer extension reaction products within minutes. The total time required for PCR, primer extension reaction and the dipstick assay is ~2 h. The method was evaluated by genotyping 45 DNA samples of known genotypes and 54 blind samples. The results were fully concordant with reference methods. The method is simple, rapid, and cost-effective. Detection by the dipstick assay does not require specialized instrumentation or highly qualified personnel. The proposed method could be a particularly useful tool in laboratories with limited resources and a basis for point-of-care diagnostics especially in combination with PCR amplification from whole blood. labels: #Globins'
b"Globin gene switching is a complex, highly regulated process allowing expression of distinct globin genes at specific developmental stages. Here, for the first time, we have characterized all of the zebrafish globins based on the completed genomic sequence. Two distinct chromosomal loci, termed major (chromosome 3) and minor (chromosome 12), harbor the globin genes containing \xce\xb1/\xce\xb2 pairs in a 5'-3' to 3'-5' orientation. Both these loci share synteny with the mammalian \xce\xb1-globin locus. Zebrafish globin expression was assayed during development and demonstrated two globin switches, similar to human development. A conserved regulatory element, the locus control region (LCR), was revealed by analyzing DNase I hypersensitive sites, H3K4 trimethylation marks and GATA1 binding sites. Surprisingly, the position of these sites with relation to the globin genes is evolutionarily conserved, despite a lack of overall sequence conservation. Motifs within the zebrafish LCR include CACCC, GATA, and NFE2 sites, suggesting functional interactions with known transcription factors but not the same LCR architecture. Functional homology to the mammalian \xce\xb1-LCR MCS-R2 region was confirmed by robust and specific reporter expression in erythrocytes of transgenic zebrafish. Our studies provide a comprehensive characterization of the zebrafish globin loci and clarify the regulation of globin switching. labels: #Globins"
b'In this study, the role of the globin moiety in the structure of this pigment has been evaluated, using myoglobin and hemin as model systems. After the synthesis of the cured pigment from the compounds used in this study, the absorption spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and electrospray ionization (ESI)/MS spectroscopy were used to evaluate the chemical structure. Results indicated that the UV/visible, IR absorption, and mass spectroscopy of the cured pigment produced from myoglobin and its counterpart without the globin moiety, hemin, are different. Whereas myoglobin produced mononitrosylheme, hemin converted to dinitrosylheme, but probably the second nitric oxide group attached to the propionate side chain of the heme ring. It seems that the globin moiety protected heme ring against the second nitric oxide group. labels: #Globins'
b'The aim of the present research was to investigate the regulation of gene expression in ovine blood leukocytes during ACTH-induced cortisol release and the effect of dietary administration of botanicals to counteract the evoked response in polymorphonucleate cells (PMNCs). Thirty-six homogeneous Sarda sheep (age, 18\xc2\xb14.1 mo; BW, 38.7\xc2\xb11.3 kg) were allotted to six groups of six sheep each. One group was used as a negative control (Saline) and five groups were treated, every 12 h for 48 h, with 0.5 mL of ACTH agonist (250 \xce\xbcg/mL of tetracosactrin). Before ACTH treatment, four of the five ACTH-treated groups were separated and fed for 22 d with a basal diet supplemented with extracts from Echinacea angustifolia roots (PO+ACTH), Echinacea angustifolia flowers (EA+ACTH), Andrographis paniculata (AP+ACTH), and the bark of Larix decidua milled (LB+ACTH). Control groups (Saline and ACTH) were fed with the same basal diet without botanicals. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples collected before (T0) and after 3 h (T3) and 51 h (T51) from the first ACTH injection, and transcriptome analysis was performed using a custom oligoarray, designed from 12,194 Ovis aries UniGenes on a CombiMatrix platform. At T3, treatment with ACTH caused down-regulation of transcripts (P<0.001) involved in "response to stress" (GADD45A, GADD45B, WRNIP1, and XRCC6) and in "innate immune response" (MAPK3 and NFkBIB). At T51, treatment with ACTH caused down-regulation (P<0.001) of genes involved in "immune response" (IFNG and IL2) and up-regulation (P<0.001) of NF-\xce\xbaB1 and TP53. Each botanical produced a different (P<0.001) molecular signature for these genes at T3 and T51. The most active botanical in modulating transcriptome modifications in PMNCs after ACTH-induced cortisol release was Larix decidua Mill bark followed by Polinacea roots. These botanicals can be viewed as promising feed supplements in ruminants to cope with conditions associated with increased concentrations of plasma cortisol. labels: #Globins'
b'Heme-regulated eIF2\xce\xb1 kinase (Hri) is necessary for balanced synthesis of heme and globin. In addition, Hri deficiency exacerbates the phenotypic severity of \xce\xb2-thalassemia intermedia in mice. Activation of Hri during heme deficiency and in \xce\xb2-thalassemia increases eIF2\xce\xb1 phosphorylation and inhibits globin translation. Under endoplasmic reticulum stress and nutrient starvation, eIF2\xce\xb1 phosphorylation also induces the Atf4 signaling pathway to mitigate stress. Although the function of Hri in regulating globin translation is well established, its role in Atf4 signaling in erythroid precursors is not known. Here, we report the role of the Hri-activated Atf4 signaling pathway in reducing oxidative stress and in promoting erythroid differentiation during erythropoiesis. On acute oxidative stress, Hri(-/-) erythroblasts suffered from increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. During chronic iron deficiency in vivo, Hri is necessary both to reduce oxidative stress and to promote erythroid differentiation. Hri(-/-) mice developed ineffective erythropoiesis during iron deficiency with inhibition of differentiation at the basophilic erythroblast stage. This inhibition is recapitulated during ex vivo differentiation of Hri(-/-) fetal liver erythroid progenitors. Importantly, the Hri-eIF2\xce\xb1P-Atf4 pathway was activated and required for erythroid differentiation. We further demonstrate the potential of modulating Hri-eIF2\xce\xb1P-Atf4 signaling with chemical compounds as pharmaceutical therapies for \xce\xb2-thalassemia. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), a neuron-specific oxygen-binding globin with an unknown function, has been proposed to play a key role in neuronal survival. We have previously shown Ngb to be highly expressed in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The present study addresses the effect of Ngb deficiency on circadian behavior. Ngb-deficient and wild-type (wt) mice were placed in running wheels and their activity rhythms, endogenous period and response to light stimuli were investigated. The effect of Ngb deficiency on the expression of Period1 (Per1) and the immediate early gene Fos was determined after light stimulation at night and the neurochemical phenotype of Ngb expressing neurons in wt mice was characterized. Loss of Ngb function had no effect on overall circadian entrainment, but resulted in a significantly larger phase delay of circadian rhythm upon light stimulation at early night. A light-induced increase in Per1, but not Fos, gene expression was observed in Ngb-deficient mice. Ngb expressing neurons which co-stored Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP) and were innervated from the eye and the geniculo-hypothalamic tract expressed FOS after light stimulation. No PER1 expression was observed in Ngb-positive neurons. The present study demonstrates for the first time that the genetic elimination of Ngb does not affect core clock function but evokes an increased behavioural response to light concomitant with increased Per1 gene expression in the SCN at early night. labels: #Globins'
b'In this paper, the preliminary study on antioxidant, enhancement of antioxidant enzymes activity, reducing the content of oxygen free radicals, delaying skin aging of the recombination cytoglobin (rCygb) purified by our lab were investigated through human keratinocyte cell line (HaCAT) H2O2 oxidative stress model, mouse skin aging model caused by continuous subcutaneous injection D-gal, rat acute liver injury model induced by CCl4 and rat skin wound healing model. The results showed that rCygb improved the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT), reduced the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as decreased the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). Skin biopsy showed that rCygb promoted angiogenesis, increased expression of collagen and improved the anti-inflammatory ability. All results displayed that rCygb improved the oxygen free radical scavenging ability, delayed skin aging and promoted wound healing. labels: #Globins'
b'Polychaetes are often used in toxicological studies to understand mechanisms of resistance and for biomarker detection, however, we know of only a few genetic pathways involved in resistance. We found the marine polychaete Ophelina sp.1 (Opheliidae) in sediment containing high copper levels and investigated this phenomenon by measuring metal accumulation in the worms and changes in gene and protein expression. We sequenced the transcriptome of Ophelina sp.1 from both the impacted and reference sediments using 454-sequencing and analysed their proteomes using differential in gel electrophoresis (DIGE). We used the sequenced transcriptome to guide protein identification. Transcripts coding for the copper chaperone, Atox1, were up-regulated in the worms inhabiting the high copper sediment. In addition, genes coding for respiratory proteins, detoxification proteins and cytoskeletal proteins were significantly altered in metal-exposed worms; many of these changes were also detected in the proteome. This dual approach has provided a better understanding of heavy metal resistance in polychaetes and we now have a wider range of suitable indicator genes and proteins for future biomarker development. labels: #Globins'
b'Protoglobin from Methanosarcina acetivorans (MaPgb) is a dimeric globin with peculiar structural properties such as a completely buried haem and two orthogonal tunnels connecting the distal cavity to the solvent. CO binding to and dissociation from MaPgb occur through a biphasic kinetics. We show that the heterogenous kinetics arises from binding to (and dissociation from) two tertiary conformations in ligation-dependent equilibrium. Ligation favours the species with high binding rate (and low dissociation rate). The equilibrium is shifted towards the species with low binding (and high dissociation) rates for the unliganded molecules. A quantitative model is proposed to describe the observed carbonylation kinetics. labels: #Globins'
b'Oxygen sensing in hypoxic neurons has been classically attributed to cytochrome c oxidase and prolyl-4-hydroxylases and involves stabilization of transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\xce\xb1 (Hif-1\xce\xb1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that mediate survival responses. On the contrary, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol during hypoxic stress triggers apoptosis in neuronal cells. We, here advocate that the redox state of neuroglobin (Ngb) could regulate both Hif-1\xce\xb1 and Nrf2 stabilization and cytochrome c release during hypoxia. The hippocampal regions showing higher expression of Ngb were less susceptible to global hypoxia-mediated neurodegeneration. During normoxia, Ngb maintained cytochrome c in the reduced state and prevented its release from mitochondria by using cellular antioxidants. Greater turnover of oxidized cytochrome c and increased utilization of cellular antioxidants during acute hypoxia altered cellular redox status and stabilized Hif-1\xce\xb1 and Nrf2 through Ngb-mediated mechanism. Chronic hypoxia, however, resulted in oxidation and degradation of Ngb, accumulation of ferric ions and release of cytochrome c that triggered apoptosis. Administration of N-acetyl-cysteine during hypoxic conditions improved neuronal survival by preventing Ngb oxidation and degradation. Taken together, these results establish a role for Ngb in regulating both the survival and apoptotic mechanisms associated with hypoxia. labels: #Globins'
b'Overwhelming evidence indicates that a high level of expression of the protein neuroglobin protects neurons in vitro, in animal models, and in humans, against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid insult. We have previously showed that neuroglobin protects neuronal cells from the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis induced by the BH3 mimetic, by preventing cytochrome c-triggered activation of caspase 9. Here, using cell and molecular biology approaches, we generated a particular neuroglobin mutant, Lys67Glu, overexpression of which confers a significant protection from the BH3 mimetic (TW-37)-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The cumulative inhibition of caspase 9 activation is significantly enhanced in Lys67Glu neuroglobin-expressing cells, as compared to wild-type neuroglobin expressing cells. A multiparameter flow cytometry analysis of TW-37-treated cells revealed that inhibition of caspase 9 activity by Lys67Glu neuroglobin is associated with the preservation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\xce\x94\xcf\x88(M) ), as well as a decreased rate of cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria. labels: #Globins'
b'AIMS: The adequacy of lung cancer diagnosis with sputum cytology depends on duration of sputum sampling. The aim of this methodological study was to determine whether the hypermethylation detection rate of RASSF1A, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and cytoglobin (CYGB) is influenced by the duration of sputum collection.METHODS: Prospective sputum samples were collected from 53 lung cancer patients and 47 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients as controls. Subjects collected spontaneous sputum at home during nine consecutive days in three canisters I, II and III (ie, days 1-3, days 4-6, days 7-9, respectively). Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was performed to assess gene promoter methylation status of RASSF1A, APC and CYGB.RESULTS: Analysis of each canister separately showed hypermethylation of RASSF1A, APC and/or CYGB in samples I, II and III, in 43%, 40% and 47% of cases, respectively. In control samples, these numbers were 4%, 2% and 4%, respectively. Cumulative analysis for days 1-6 and days 1-9 revealed an increase in sensitivity to 53% and 64%, and specificity of 94% and 91%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Sputum collected over multiple successive days results in a gain in sensitivity for the detection of lung cancer, at the expense of a small loss in specificity. Condensed abstract Assessment of hypermethylation sensitivity of biomarkers in sputum collected over a prolonged period for the detection of lung cancer resulted in a promising gain in sensitivity, at the expense of a small loss in specificity. labels: #Globins'
b"OBJECTIVE: To investigate mutation spectrums of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-haemoglobin genes in thalassemia patients and carriers in Yunnan province, and to establish procedures on prenatal gene diagnosis.METHODS: Totally 10 033 counseling couples and pregnant women, and 22 cases of children with moderate or severe thalassemia were recruited from 5 parts of Yunnan Province, middle, western, eastern, southern and northern areas, during July 2009 to July 2011. Medical records, including results of haemoglobin electrophoresis, blood routine examination, and gene diagnosis of subjects were collected and saved in an database in Excel software by the Key Laboratory for Birth Defects and Genetic Diseases. Using multiple gap-PCR and PCR-reversed dot blotting kits, DNA samples collected from 1077 cases of haematological positive thalassemia patients and carriers were tested to determine common mutations of the \xce\xb1- or \xce\xb2-haemoglobin genes. The codon regions of haemoglobin genes were sequenced by the Sanger sequencing in cases that the mutation tests were negative. Mutation spectrums of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-haemoglobin genes were concluded. Prenatal gene diagnosis was offered to fetuses who had risk of thalassemia major.RESULTS: (1) In 1077 cases of haemological screen positive subjects, deletions and mutations of \xce\xb1-haemoglobin gene were tested in 119 subjects among 347 cases suspected as \xce\xb1-thalassemia patients and carriers. Five kinds of deletions and mutations on \xce\xb1-haemoglobin gene were found. In 104 subjects, four kinds of common deletions and mutations on\xce\xb1-haemoglobin gene were determined: --(SEA), -\xce\xb1(3.7), \xce\xb1(CS)\xce\xb1, -\xce\xb1(4.2). Other 14 subjects were double heterozygotes with haemoglobin H disease and severe \xce\xb1-thalassemia phenotypes. A rare mutation of insertion and deletion in \xce\xb12 haemoglobin gene intron, \xce\xb1(301-24_301-23 indel), was found in one carrier subject. (2) In 1077 cases of haemological screen positive subjects, deletions and mutations of \xce\xb2-haemoglobin gene were tested in 297 subjects among 730 cases suspected as \xce\xb2-thalassemia patients and carriers. Sixteen kinds of \xce\xb2-haemoglobin gene mutations were found, including 7 cases of rare abnormal haemoglobinopathy patients with \xce\xb2-haemoglobin gene mutations. In one case with \xce\xb2(+) phenotype patient, the Codon 5(-CT) mutation at \xce\xb2-haemoglobin gene was found (firstly reported in China). (3) Three fetuses with high risks of \xce\xb1-thalassemia were accepted for prenatal diagnosis. One case of Hb Bart's hydrops syndrome fetus with the genotype --(SEA)/--(SEA), and one case of mild \xce\xb1-thalassemia fetus with the genotype \xce\xb1(CS)\xce\xb1/\xce\xb1\xce\xb1 were found. Another one fetus was found with normal \xce\xb1-haemoglobin. In 6 fetuses accepted for prenatal diagnosis due to high risks of \xce\xb2-thalassemia, one case of \xce\xb2-thalassemia major with the genotype CD(17)(A\xe2\x86\x92T)/-28(A\xe2\x86\x92G) was found, 3 fetuses were heterozygote carriers, and 2 fetuses had normal genotypes without mutations found in their parents. Medical terminations for 2 fetuses with severe thalassemia were made according to the choice of pregnant women. Other 7 pregnancies continued to term. Anemia or growth retardation was not found in the 7 infants when following up after given-birth 6 to 12 months.CONCLUSIONS: The mutation spectrums of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-haemoglobin genes of thalassemia patients and carriers in Yunnan province are special, in which \xce\xb2-haemoglobin gene exits more polymorphism in the mutation spectrum. Carrier screening in pregnant women, and offering prenatal gene diagnosis to the high risk pregnancies should be an efficient strategy to prevent thalassemia major. labels: #Globins"
b"X-ray atomic structure of recombinant Hell's gate globin I (HGbI) from Methylacidophilum infernorum was calculated from the X-ray diffraction data of two different types of crystals: obtained by classical hanging drop and by LB nanotemplate method under the same crystallization conditions. After the accurate comparison of crystallographic parameters and electron density maps of two structures they appears to be quite similar, while the quality of the crystals grown by LB nanotemplate method was higher then of those grown by classical method. Indeed, the resolution of the LB crystal structure was 1.65 \xc3\x85, while classical crystals showed only 3.2 \xc3\x85 resolution. Moreover, the reproducibility of this result in the case of LB crystals was much better-nine crystals from 10 gave the same structural results, while only two of 10 classical crystals were appropriate for the X-ray structure resolution. labels: #Globins"
b'BACKGROUND: All globins belong to one of three families: the F (flavohemoglobin) and S (sensor) families that exhibit the canonical 3/3 \xce\xb1-helical fold, and the T (truncated 3/3 fold) globins characterized by a shortened 2/2 \xce\xb1-helical fold. All eukaryote 3/3 hemoglobins are related to the bacterial single domain F globins. It is known that Fungi contain flavohemoglobins and single domain S globins. Our aims are to provide a census of fungal globins and to examine their relationships to bacterial globins.RESULTS: Examination of 165 genomes revealed that globins are present in>90% of Ascomycota and ~60% of Basidiomycota genomes. The S globins occur in Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota in addition to the phyla that have FHbs. Unexpectedly, group 1 T globins were found in one Blastocladiomycota and one Chytridiomycota genome. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the fungal globins, alone and aligned with representative bacterial globins. The Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes with two FHbs form two widely divergent clusters separated by the remaining fungal sequences. One of the Saccharomycete groups represents a new subfamily of FHbs, comprising a previously unknown N-terminal and a FHb missing the C-terminal moiety of its reductase domain. The two Saccharomycete groups also form two clusters in the presence of bacterial FHbs; the surrounding bacterial sequences are dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacilli (Firmicutes). The remaining fungal FHbs cluster with Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The Sgbs cluster separately from their bacterial counterparts, except for the intercalation of two Planctomycetes and a Proteobacterium between the Fungi incertae sedis and the Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota.CONCLUSION: Our results are compatible with a model of globin evolution put forward earlier, which proposed that eukaryote F, S and T globins originated via horizontal gene transfer of their bacterial counterparts to the eukaryote ancestor, resulting from the endosymbiotic events responsible for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. labels: #Globins'
b'We hypothesize that the various, previously reported, reactivities of neuroglobin with redox partners and oxygen provide for the establishment of a redox cycle within cells, such as neurons and retinal rod cells. Using native cell lysates, from cultured human cells of neuronal origin, we have estimated the rate of reduction of the oxidized form of neuroglobin in vivo. Furthermore we provide evidence that the cytosol of these cells contains factors (presumably enzymes) capable of employing either glutathione or NADH as re-reductants of ferric neuroglobin. Taken in conjunction with previous rate data, for the various redox reactions of neuroglobin, this information allows us to set up a computer model to estimate the steady state cellular level of the antiapoptotic ferrous form of neuroglobin. This model indicates that the steady state level of antiapoptotic neuroglobin is very sensitive to the cellular oxygen tension and moderately sensitive to the redox status of the cell. Further analysis indicates that such a system would be capable of significant modification, on the seconds time scale, following hypoxic transition, as is likely in stroke. We hypothesize that this mechanism might provide a moderately rapid mechanism for adjusting the antiapoptotic status of a cell, whilst the reaction of neuroglobin with mitochondrial cytochrome c provides a very rapid, but limited, capacity to intervene in the apoptotic pathway. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin is an intracellular globin of unknown function that is expressed mostly in cells of a myofibroblast lineage. Possible functions of cytoglobin include buffering of intracellular oxygen and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that cytoglobin affords protection from oxidant-induced DNA damage when over expressed in vitro, but the importance of this in more physiologically relevant models of disease is unknown. Cytoglobin is a candidate for the tylosis with oesophageal cancer gene, and its expression is strongly down-regulated in non-cancerous oesophageal biopsies from patients with TOC compared with normal biopsies. Therefore, oesophageal cells provide an ideal experimental model to test our hypothesis that downregulation of cytoglobin expression sensitises cells to the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species, particularly oxidative DNA damage, and that this could potentially contribute to the TOC phenotype. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis by manipulating cytoglobin expression in both normal and oesophageal cancer cell lines, which have normal physiological and no expression of cytoglobin respectively. Our results show that, in agreement with previous findings, over expression of cytoglobin in cancer cell lines afforded protection from chemically-induced oxidative stress but this was only observed at non-physiological concentrations of cytoglobin. In addition, down regulation of cytoglobin in normal oesophageal cells had no effect on their sensitivity to oxidative stress as assessed by a number of end points. We therefore conclude that normal physiological concentrations of cytoglobin do not offer cytoprotection from reactive oxygen species, at least in the current experimental model. labels: #Globins'
b'It has been proposed that the frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of an             entire chromosome 17 contig in epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) is the consequence             of the inactivation of multiple tumour suppressor genes on this chromosome. We             report the characterization of a 453 Kb 17q25 locus shown previously to exhibit             a high frequency of LOH in EOC samples. LOH analysis further defined the minimal             region of deletion to a 65 Kb interval flanked by D17S2239 and D17S2244, which             contains RHBDF2, CYGB and PRCD as tumour suppressor gene candidates. Tissue specific             expression excluded PRCD as a candidate. RHBDF2 was expressed at low levels in             the majority of benign and low malignant potential (LMP) tumours, and in a subset             of malignant ovarian tumour samples, as compared with primary cultures of normal             ovarian surface epithelial cell (NOSE) samples. CYGB was expressed at low levels             in the majority of LMP and malignant samples compared with benign and NOSE samples.             In contrast to CYGB expression, RHBDF2 was expressed at low or undetectable levels             in EOC cell lines exhibiting tumourigenic characteristics and up-regulated in             a genetically modified EOC cell line rendered non-tumourigenic. DNA sequence analysis             identified variants but no apparent deleterious mutations in either gene. Methylation-specific             PCR analysis suggested that promoter methylation of CYGB but not RHBDF2 occurred             in 6 of 31 malignant samples. The results combined suggest that RHBDF2 and CYGB             may play distinctive roles in ovarian cancer and could be added to the growing             roster of chromosome 17 genes implicated in this disease. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a hypoxia-inducible protein with cytoprotective effects in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and related disorders, but the molecular mechanisms involved in its induction are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) regulates Ngb levels, using shRNA-mediated knockdown and lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the HIF-1\xce\xb1 subunit, in cultured neural (HN33) cells. HIF-1\xce\xb1 knockdown decreased and HIF-1\xce\xb1 overexpression increased Ngb levels, consistent with a connection between HIF-1 and Ngb induction. These findings may have implications for understanding the hypoxia-response repertoire of neural cells and devising therapeutic strategies for neurologic disorders. labels: #Globins"
b'Based on previous studies on bis-acetamides that act as hybrid polar compounds to induce leukemia cell differentiation, an attempt was made to bioisosterically replace the amide moiety with the lipophilic non-classical bioisostere tetrazole. A pyrrole group was also included in the molecule in order to retain the hydrogen bond donor capability. Thus, by linking the two polar ring systems with a highly lipophilic methylene chain compounds 2-4 were synthesized and assessed for their anti-proliferative activity in combination with their ability to induce murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Furthermore, an initial investigation of the structure-activity relation points for the active compound 3 was undertaken by synthesizing compound 5 (a p-xylene analog) and compound 8 (a methylamidopyrrolyl analog). All compounds caused a dose-dependent inhibition of MEL cell growth but to a different extent. Compound 3 (1,6-bis[5-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-2H-tetrazol-2-yl]hexane) promoted erythroid differentiation in a fifty-fold lower concentration than hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA). Though induction of differentiation was to a lesser extent than HMBA, it caused accumulation of 80% Hb-producing cells as compared to that produced by HMBA, leading to differentiation-depended cell growth inhibition equal to that of HMBA after 96\xc2\xa0h in culture. Compound 3 represents a potent inducer of hemoglobin gene activation in leukemic cells. labels: #Globins'
b'In the Metazoa, globin proteins display an underlying unity in tertiary structure that belies an extraordinary diversity in primary structures, biochemical properties, and physiological functions. Phylogenetic reconstructions can reveal which of these functions represent novel, lineage-specific innovations, and which represent ancestral functions that are shared with homologous globin proteins in other eukaryotes and even prokaryotes. To date, our understanding of globin diversity in deuterostomes has been hindered by a dearth of genomic sequence data from the Ambulacraria (echinoderms + hemichordates), the sister group of chordates, and the phylum Xenacoelomorpha, which includes xenoturbellids, acoelomorphs, and nemertodermatids. Here, we report the results of a phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis of the globin gene repertoire of deuterostomes. We first characterized the globin genes of the acorn worm, Saccoglossus kowalevskii, a representative of the phylum Hemichordata. We then integrated genomic sequence data from the acorn worm into a comprehensive analysis of conserved synteny and phylogenetic relationships among globin genes from representatives of the eight lineages that comprise the superphylum Deuterostomia. The primary aims were 1) to unravel the evolutionary history of the globin gene superfamily in deuterostomes and 2) to use the estimated phylogeny to gain insights into the functional evolution of deuterostome globins. Results of our analyses indicate that the deuterostome common ancestor possessed a repertoire of at least four distinct globin paralogs and that different subsets of these ancestral genes have been retained in each of the descendant organismal lineages. In each major deuterostome group, a different subset of ancestral precursor genes underwent lineage-specific expansions of functional diversity through repeated rounds of gene duplication and divergence. By integrating results of the phylogenetic analysis with available functional data, we discovered that circulating oxygen-transport hemoglobins evolved independently in several deuterostome lineages and that intracellular nerve globins evolved independently in chordates and acoelomorph worms. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVES: (1) To investigate the effects of globin mRNA depletion in detecting differential gene expression in peripheral blood and (2) to investigate changes in peripheral blood gene expression in atopic asthmatic individuals undergoing allergen inhalation challenge.METHODS: Asthmatic subjects (20-60 years of age, with stable, mild allergic asthma, n = 9) underwent allergen inhalation challenges. All had an early asthmatic response of \xe2\x89\xa520% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Blood was collected immediately prior to and 2 hours after allergen challenge using PAXgene tubes (n = 4) and EDTA tubes (n = 5). Aliquots of the PAXgene blood samples were subjected to globin reduction (PAX-GR). Transcriptome analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip(\xc2\xae) Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Data were preprocessed using factor analysis for robust microarray summarization and analyzed using linear models for microarrays. Pathway analyses were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.RESULTS: Globin reduction uncovered probe sets of lower abundance. However, it significantly reduced the ability to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when compared to non-globin-reduced PAXgene samples (PAX-NGR). Combined transcriptional analysis of four PAX-NGR and five EDTA sample pairs identified 1595 DEGs associated with allergen inhalation challenge (false discovery rate \xe2\x89\xa4 5%), with the top-ranked network of perturbed biological functions consisting of inflammatory response, cellular movement, and immune cell trafficking.CONCLUSIONS: While we have demonstrated a diminished ability to detect DEGs after globin reduction, we have nevertheless identified significant changes in the peripheral blood transcriptome of people with mild asthma 2 hours after allergen inhalation challenge. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Transcriptome analysis is of great interest in clinical research, where significant differences between individuals can be translated into biomarkers of disease. Although next generation sequencing provides robust, comparable and highly informative expression profiling data, with several million of tags per blood sample, reticulocyte globin transcripts can constitute up to 76% of total mRNA compromising the detection of low abundant transcripts. We have removed globin transcripts from 6 human whole blood RNA samples with a human globin reduction kit and compared them with the same non-reduced samples using deep Serial Analysis of Gene Expression.RESULTS: Globin tags comprised 52-76% of total tags in our samples. Out of 21,633 genes only 87 genes were detected at significantly lower levels in the globin reduced samples. In contrast, 11,338 genes were detected at significantly higher levels in the globin reduced samples. Removing globin transcripts allowed us to also identify 2112 genes that could not be detected in the non-globin reduced samples, with roles in cell surface receptor signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor protein signalling pathways and neurological processes.CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of globin transcripts in whole blood samples constitutes a reproducible and reliable method that can enrich data obtained from next generation sequencing-based expression profiling. labels: #Globins'
b'Ngb (neuroglobin) has been identified as a novel endogenous neuroprotectant. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of Ngb expression, especially under conditions of hypoxia. In the present study, we located the core proximal promoter of the mouse Ngb gene to a 554\xc2\xa0bp segment, which harbours putative conserved NF-\xce\xbaB (nuclear factor \xce\xbaB)- and Egr1 (early growth-response factor 1) -binding sites. Overexpression and knockdown of transcription factors p65, p50, Egr1 or Sp1 (specificity protein 1) increased and decreased Ngb expression respectively. Experimental assessments with transfections of mutational Ngb gene promoter constructs, as well as EMSA (electrophoretic mobility-shift assay) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays, demonstrated that NF-\xce\xbaB family members (p65, p50 and cRel), Egr1 and Sp1 bound in vitro and in vivo to the proximal promoter region of the Ngb gene. Moreover, a \xce\xbaB3 site was found as a pivotal cis-element responsible for hypoxia-induced Ngb promoter activity. NF-\xce\xbaB (p65) and Sp1 were also responsible for hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Ngb expression. Although there are no conserved HREs (hypoxia-response elements) in the promoter of the mouse Ngb gene, the results of the present study suggest that HIF-1\xce\xb1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1\xce\xb1) is also involved in hypoxia-induced Ngb up-regulation. In conclusion, we have identified that NF-\xce\xbaB, Egr1 and Sp1 played important roles in the regulation of basal Ngb expression via specific interactions with the mouse Ngb promoter. NF-\xce\xbaB, Sp1 and HIF-1\xce\xb1 contributed to the up-regulation of mouse Ngb gene expression under hypoxic conditions. labels: #Globins'
b'Fetal  hemoglobin (Hb F) is characteristic of the fetal development period. However,  in some genetic conditions, such as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin  (HPFH) and delta-beta thalassemia (\xce\xb4\xce\xb2-thalassemia), Hb F continues to be produced in  adulthood. We evaluated the frequency of two mutations of HPFH, HPFH-1 and  HPFH-2 African, and two mutations in \xce\xb4\xce\xb2-thalassemia, Sicilian and Spanish, in a Brazilian  population. Peripheral blood samples were collected from adults from hospitals  and blood centers in southeast and northeast Brazil. These individuals were  healthy and without complaints of anemia, but had increased Hb F. Samples were  submitted to electrophoretic and chromatographic analyses to quantify Hb F  values and, subsequently, to molecular analyses to verify the mutations. In the  molecular analysis, 16 of the 60 samples showed a heterozygous profile for the  HPFH mutations, two for HPFH-1 and 14 for HPFH-2. In the same sample set, three  were heterozygous for Spanish \xce\xb4\xce\xb2-thalassemia  and none were heterozygous for Sicilian \xce\xb4\xce\xb2- thalassemia. The Hb F values in the HPFH-2  heterozygotes differed from those previously reported for this mutation. In  this group, the HPFH mutations were more frequent than the \xce\xb4\xce\xb2-thalassemia  mutations. The finding of these mutations in this Brazilian population reflects  the mixing process that occurred during its formation. labels: #Globins'
b'PURPOSE: Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a vertebrate globin that is predominantly expressed in the retina and brain. To explore the role of Ngb in retinal neuroprotection during ischemia reperfusion (IR), the authors examined the effect of Ngb overexpression in the retina in vivo by using Ngb-transgenic (Ngb-Tg) mice.METHODS: Retinal IR was induced in Ngb overexpressing Ngb-Tg mice and wild type (WT) mice by cannulating the anterior chamber and transiently elevating the IOP for 60 minutes. After Day 7 of reperfusion, the authors evaluated Ngb mRNA and protein expression in nonischemic control as well as ischemic mice and its effect on retinal histology, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and apoptosis, using morphometry and immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR analysis and Western blot techniques.RESULTS: Ngb-Tg mice without ischemia overexpress Ngb mRNA 11.3-fold (SE \xc2\xb1 0.457, P<0.05) higher than WT control mice, and this overexpression of Ngb protein was localized to the mitochondria of the ganglion cells, outer and inner plexiform layers, and photoreceptor inner segments. This overexpression of Ngb is associated with decreased mitochondrial DNA damage in Ngb-Tg mice with IR in comparison with WT. Ngb-Tg mice with IR also revealed significant preservation of retinal thickness, significantly less activated caspase 3 protein expression, and apoptosis in comparison with WT mice.CONCLUSIONS: Neuroglobin overexpression plays a neuroprotective role against retinal ischemia reperfusion injury due to decreasing of mitochondrial oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Neuroglobin (Ngb), a neuron-specific globin that binds oxygen in vitro, has been proposed to play a key role in neuronal survival following hypoxic and ischemic insults in the brain. Here we address whether Ngb is required for neuronal survival following acute and prolonged hypoxia in mice genetically Ngb-deficient (Ngb-null). Further, to evaluate whether the lack of Ngb has an effect on hypoxia-dependent gene regulation, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Differential expression was estimated by a novel data analysis approach, which applies non-parametric statistical inference directly to probe level measurements.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ngb-null mice were born in expected ratios and were normal in overt appearance, home-cage behavior, reproduction and longevity. Ngb deficiency had no effect on the number of neurons, which stained positive for surrogate markers of endogenous Ngb-expressing neurons in the wild-type (wt) and Ngb-null mice after 48 hours hypoxia. However, an exacerbated hypoxia-dependent increase in the expression of c-FOS protein, an immediate early transcription factor reflecting neuronal activation, and increased expression of Hif1A mRNA were observed in Ngb-null mice. Large-scale gene expression analysis identified differential expression of the glycolytic pathway genes after acute hypoxia in Ngb-null mice, but not in the wts. Extensive hypoxia-dependent regulation of chromatin remodeling, mRNA processing and energy metabolism pathways was apparent in both genotypes.SIGNIFICANCE: According to these results, it appears unlikely that the loss of Ngb affects neuronal viability during hypoxia in vivo. Instead, Ngb-deficiency appears to enhance the hypoxia-dependent response of Hif1A and c-FOS protein while also altering the transcriptional regulation of the glycolytic pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of differential gene expression yielded novel predictions suggesting that chromatin remodeling and mRNA metabolism are among the key regulatory mechanisms when adapting to prolonged hypoxia. labels: #Globins'
b'AIMS: We investigated the effects of globin digest (GD) and its active ingredient Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg (WTQR) on galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS)-induced liver injury in imprinting control region (ICR) mice.MAIN METHODS: The effects of WTQR and GD on the liver injury were examined by measuring the survival rate, serum aminotransferase activities, hepatic components, antioxidant enzyme activities, histopathological analysis, serum levels and hepatic gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\xce\xb1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and nitric oxide (NO) or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\xce\xbaB) p65 content in GalN/LPS-treated ICR mice. RAW264 mouse macrophages were used to confirm the anti-inflammatory effects of WTQR and GD on the macrophages.KEY FINDINGS: WTQR and GD increased the survival rate, suppressed the serum aminotransferase activities, serum levels and hepatic gene expression of TNF-\xce\xb1, MIP-2, and NO or iNOS, and nuclear NF-\xce\xbaB p65 content in GalN/LPS-treated mice; decreased the oxidized glutathione content, increased the superoxide dismutase activity, and decreased the histopathological grade values of the hepatocyte necrosis and lobular inflammation in GalN/LPS-injured liver; and suppressed the release levels and gene expression of TNF-\xce\xb1, MIP-2, and NO or iNOS, and nuclear NF-\xce\xbaB p65 content in LPS-stimulated RAW264 macrophages. WTQR and GD may improve the antioxidant defense system and inflammatory status in GalN/LPS-injured liver.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that WTQR and GD have hepatoprotective effects on GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in ICR mice. labels: #Globins'
b'Comparative genomic studies have led to the recent identification of several novel globin types in the Metazoa. They have revealed a surprising evolutionary diversity of functions beyond the familiar O(2) supply roles of hemoglobin and myoglobin. Here we report the discovery of a hitherto unrecognized family of proteins with a unique modular architecture, possessing an N-terminal calpain-like domain, an internal, circular permuted globin domain, and an IQ calmodulin-binding motif. Putative orthologs are present in the genomes of many metazoan taxa, including vertebrates. The calpain-like region is homologous to the catalytic domain II of the large subunit of human calpain-7. The globin domain satisfies the criteria of a myoglobin-like fold but is rearranged and split into two parts. The recombinantly expressed human globin domain exhibits an absorption spectrum characteristic of hexacoordination of the heme iron atom. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that this chimeric globin family is phylogenetically ancient and originated in the common ancestor to animals and choanoflagellates. In humans and mice, the gene is predominantly expressed in testis tissue, and we propose the name "androglobin" (Adgb). Expression is associated with postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis and is insensitive to experimental hypoxia. Evidence exists for increased gene expression in fertile compared with infertile males. labels: #Globins'
b"STUDY DESIGN: We introduced a lentiviral vector containing the neuroglobin (Ngb) gene into the injured spinal cords to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Ngb in a rabbit model of spinal cord injury (SCI).OBJECTIVES: It is not clear whether Ngb has the neuroprotective role to SCI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible protective effects of the Ngb overexpression on traumatic SCI in rabbits.SETTING: Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, People's Republic of China.METHODS: A lentiviral vector containing Ngb gene was constructed and injected at the SCI sites 24 h after SCI. The rabbits' motor functions were evaluated by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan rating scale. Quantitative real-time PCRs, western blots, malondialdehyde (MDA) tests and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP end labeling assays were also performed.RESULTS: The Ngb expression in the LV-Ngb group increased significantly at days 7, 14 and 21. A more significant functional improvement was observed in the LV-Ngb group compared with the improvements in all other groups at days 14 and 21. The traumatic SCI seemed to lead to an increase in the levels of MDA and in the number of the apoptotic cells, which could be prevented by the LV-Ngb treatment.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the Ngb overexpression may have potential therapeutic benefits for both reducing secondary damages and improving the outcomes after traumatic SCI. labels: #Globins"
b'The aim of this study was to reveal the protection role and the related mechanism of cytoglobin on the oxidation induced hepatic stellate cell damage. We applied siRNA to interfere the endogenous cytoglobin gene, used recombinant cytoglobin protein to treat the completely activated human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 and the incompletely activated primary rat hepatic stellate cells, or over-expressed cytoglobin protein in LX-2 cells. We used two different oxidative-stress related models, the hydrogen peroxide model and the iron-overload model in our experiments and investigated the proliferation status and the intracellular superoxide level of the cells. The results showed that endogenous cytoglobin exerted significant protective effects on hydrogen peroxide or iron-overload induced LX-2 cell damage, confirming that upregulation of cytoglobin was the protective response of activated hepatic stellate cells to oxidative stress. Recombinant cytoglobin protein could protect LX-2 cells from oxidation induced damage, and prevent primary rat hepatic stellate cells from excessive proliferation and injury. The cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity of the recombinant cytoglobin protein was not as good as its capacity in scavenging ROS outside the cells, likely owing to the lack of active transporting mechanisms. Intracellular over-expression of cytoglobin protein could exert significant protective effect on LX-2 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or iron-overload. Our results would accelerate the exploitation of new anti-fibrotic targets. labels: #Globins'
b'Plants often face hypoxic stress as a result of flooding and waterlogged soils. During these periods, they must continue ATP production and nitrogen metabolism if they are to survive. The normal pathway of reductive nitrogen assimilation in non-legumes, nitrate, and nitrite reductase can be inhibited during low oxygen conditions that are associated with the buildup of toxic metabolites such as nitrite and nitric oxide, so the plant must also have a means of detoxifying these molecules. Compared to animal hemoglobins, plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins are adept at reducing nitrite to nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. Here we test their abilities to reduce hydroxylamine, a proposed intermediate of nitrite reductase, under anaerobic conditions. We find that class 1 rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin (rice nsHb1) and the hemoglobin from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis (SynHb) catalyze the reduction of hydroxylamine to ammonium at rates 100-2500 times faster than animal hemoglobins including myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, and blood cell hemoglobin. These results support the hypothesis that plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins contribute to anaerobic nitrogen metabolism in support of anaerobic respiration and survival during hypoxia. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a globin protein that is highly and specifically expressed in brain neurons. A large volume of evidence has proven that Ngb is a neuroprotective molecule against hypoxic/ischemic brain injury and other related neurological disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Aiming to provide more clues in understanding the molecular mechanisms of Ngb's neuroprotection, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to search for proteins that interact with Ngb. From a mouse brain cDNA library, we found totally 36 proteins that potentially interact with Ngb, and 10 of them were each identified in multiple positive clones. The shared sequences within these multiple clones are more likely to be Ngb-interacting domains. In primary cultured mouse cortical neurons, immuno-precipitation was performed to confirm the interactions of selected proteins with Ngb. The discovered Ngb-interacting proteins in this study include those involved in energy metabolism, mitochondria function, and signaling pathways for cell survival and proliferation. Our findings provide molecular targets for investigating protein interaction-based biological functions and neuroprotective mechanisms of Ngb. labels: #Globins"
b'As the Southern Ocean cooled to -1.8 \xc2\xb0C over the past 40 My, the teleostean clade Notothenioidei diversified and, under reduced selection pressure for an oxygen-transporting apparatus, became less reliant on hemoglobin and red blood cells. At the extreme of this trend, the crown group of Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae) lost both components of oxygen transport. Under the decreased selection scenario, we hypothesized that the Antarctic dragonfishes (Bathydraconidae, the red-blooded sister clade to the icefishes) evolved lower blood hemoglobin concentrations because their globin gene complexes (\xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin gene pairs linked by a regulatory intergene) transcribe globin mRNAs less effectively than those of basal notothenioids (e.g., the Nototheniidae [notothens]). To test our hypothesis, we 1) sequenced the \xce\xb1/\xce\xb2-intergenes of the adult globin complexes of three notothen and eight dragonfish species and 2) measured globin transcript levels in representative species from each group. The typical nototheniid intergene was \xe2\x88\xbc3-4 kb in length. The bathydraconid intergenes resolved into three subclasses (long [3.8 kb], intermediate [3.0 kb], and short [1.5-2.3 kb]) that corresponded to the three subclades proposed for the taxon. Although they varied in length due to indels, the three notothen and eight dragonfish intergenes contained a conserved \xe2\x88\xbc90-nt element that we have previously shown to be required for globin gene transcription. Using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that globin mRNA levels in red cells from one notothen species and from one species of each dragonfish subclade were equivalent statistically. Thus, our results indicate that the bathydraconids have evolved adult globin loci whose regulatory intergenes tend to be shorter than those of the more basal nototheniids yet are equivalent in transcriptional efficacy. Their low blood hemoglobin concentrations are most likely due to reduction in hematocrit. labels: #Globins'
b"Hemoglobin of bony fish and higher vertebrates is a tetrameric protein constructed by 2 \xce\xb1- and 2 \xce\xb2-globins, which are expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner. The genomic organization of genes for embryonic and adult \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin varies from species to species. In fish, it is known that there is a unique genomic organization of globin genes, that is, \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes are arranged in a bi-directional and head-to-head orientation with respect to transcription start sites. In medaka, we have demonstrated that 14 globin genes are located in 2 different clusters, and 5 pairs of the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes were found to be organized in a head-to-head orientation. The developmental expression patterns of the 11 globin genes were classified into 4 types. To clarify how their developmental stage-specific expressions are regulated, we produced 4 types of GFP- or RFP-transgenic medaka. Such transgenic medaka revealed that each of the 1-1.7 kbp 5' upstream sequences from respective globin genes possesses the ability to regulate the developmental stage-specific globin gene expression. In particular, the intervals between head-to-head \xce\xb13 and \xce\xb23, and \xce\xb14 and \xce\xb24 genes controlled the synchronized expression of the globin genes located at both sides of the intervals, which is significant to understand the mechanism by which equal amounts of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globins are expressed in erythroid cells. We also demonstrated that the head-to-head intervals can control the expression of the globin genes located at both sides. These findings are significant to understand the mechanism by which \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globins are equally expressed in erythroid cells. labels: #Globins"
b'BACKGROUND: Proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) has been proposed as a potential precursor for prostate cancer. The precise molecular abnormalities in prostatic atrophy compared to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and carcinoma have not been fully defined.METHODS: We utilized laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis to characterize cells of PIA, HGPIN, invasive prostatic carcinoma, and non-atrophic benign prostatic epithelium (NABE). Cytoglobin was selected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) validation. IHC stains were evaluated for proportion of positive glands, and intensity of cytoglobin staining. An immunoreactive score (IR score) was determined as the product of the percentage of positive staining and intensity.RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed probe sets that separated the microdissected cell types. Several genes showed overlapping expression patterns between PIA and PIN, and HGPIN and invasive carcinoma. Cytoglobin protein expression was detected in 57/93 (61%) of NABE and BPH cases, 92/93 atrophy (99%), 3/34 (9%) of PIN, and 23/61 carcinoma (37%) samples. The highest IHC scores were calculated for atrophy foci. A subset (33%) of atrophy cases showed the same low-cytoglobin expression level as PIN and carcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: Prostatic epithelium can be stratified into normal, atrophic, PIN, and invasive carcinoma categories based on differential genetic signatures. Cytoglobin, a protein that can be induced in response to oxidative stress, was elevated in most atrophy foci, suggesting hypoxic, and/or oxidative damage. The lower level of cytoglobin seen in neoplastic cells and 33% of atrophy foci may indicate a shared susceptibility to oxidative damage for this subset of atrophy cases and prostatic neoplasia. labels: #Globins'
b'Activation of erythropoietin receptor allows erythroblasts to generate erythrocytes. In a search for genes that are up-regulated during this differentiation process, we have identified ISG15 as being induced during late erythroid differentiation. ISG15 belongs to the ubiquitin-like protein family and is covalently linked to target proteins by the enzymes of the ISGylation machinery. Using both in vivo and in vitro differentiating erythroblasts, we show that expression of ISG15 as well as the ISGylation process related enzymes Ube1L, UbcM8 and Herc6 are induced during erythroid differentiation. Loss of ISG15 in mice results in decreased number of BFU-E/CFU-E in bone marrow, concomitant with an increased number of these cells in the spleen of these animals. ISG15(-/-) bone marrow and spleen-derived erythroblasts show a less differentiated phenotype both in vivo and in vitro, and over-expression of ISG15 in erythroblasts is found to facilitate erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, we have shown that important players of erythroid development, such as STAT5, Globin, PLC \xce\xb3 and ERK2 are ISGylated in erythroid cells. This establishes a new role for ISG15, besides its well-characterized anti-viral functions, during erythroid differentiation. labels: #Globins'
b'Study on the phenotypic expression of hemoglobin (Hb) A(2) and Hb E in Hb E disorders has been difficult due to the co-separation of Hb A(2) and Hb E in most Hb analysis assays. Because these two Hbs are separated on capillary electrophoresis, we studied phenotypic expression of Hbs A(2), E and F in various Hb E disorders using this system. This was done on 362 subjects with several Hb E disorders including heterozygous Hb E, homozygous Hb E, \xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E, \xce\xb4\xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E, and Hb Lepore/Hb E and those of these disorders with several forms of \xce\xb1-thalassemia. Normal controls showed Hb A(2) of 2.7 \xc2\xb1 0.3%. Heterozygous Hb E and homozygous Hb E had elevated Hb A(2) i.e. 3.8 \xc2\xb1 0.3% and 4.8 \xc2\xb1 0.5%, respectively. Further elevations were observed for \xce\xb2(0)-thalassemia/Hb E (6.1 \xc2\xb1 1.9%) and \xce\xb2(+)-thalassemia/Hb E (7.1 \xc2\xb1 1.2%). Interestingly, no elevation of Hb A(2) was found in the \xce\xb4\xce\xb2-thalassemia/Hb E, and Hb Lepore/Hb E (2.3 \xc2\xb1 0.3%) but higher Hb F levels were noted which could be useful diagnostic markers. The levels of Hb E were variable. Co-inheritance of these Hb E disorders with \xce\xb1-thalassemia were associated with lower outputs of Hb E and Hb F but the levels of Hb A(2) were not altered. Different phenotypic expression of Hb A(2), Hb E and Hb F could help in differential diagnosis of these Hb E related disorders commonly encountered in the regions where access to molecular techniques is limited. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (NGB) is a characterized heme globin that is widely expressed in the vertebrate central and peripheral nervous system as well as retina and endocrine tissues. However, to date, it is not determined whether functional NGB is expressed in cells of glia origin. In this study, we aimed to explore the detailed expression of NGB in a rat astrocytoma cell line (C6) and human astrocytoma cell line (U251) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting, and to detect the expression of NGB in human astrocytoma tissues by an immunohistochemical method. We found that NGB was present in a rat astrocytoma cell line (C6), human astrocytoma cell line (U251), and human astrocytoma tissues. The expression and potential roles of NGB in astrocytomas may provide insight into the mechanisms of tumor cells to adapt and survive in hypoxic microenvironments and also represent a novel therapeutic approach to astrocytomas. labels: #Globins'
b'The vertebrate globin gene repertoire consists of seven members that differ in terms of structure, function and phyletic distribution. While hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytoglobin, and neuroglobin are present in almost all gnathostomes examined so far, other globin genes, like globin X, are much more restricted in their phyletic distribution. Till today, globin X has only been found in teleost fish and Xenopus. Here, we report that globin X is also present in the genomes of the sea lamprey, ghost shark and reptiles. Moreover, the identification of orthologs of globin X in crustacean, insects, platyhelminthes, and hemichordates confirms its ancient origin. labels: #Globins'
b'Acute inhalation of combustion smoke causes neurological deficits in survivors. Inhaled smoke includes carbon monoxide, noxious gases, and a hypoxic environment, which disrupt oxygenation and generate free radicals. To replicate a smoke-inhalation scenario, we developed an experimental model of acute exposure to smoke for the awake mouse/rat and detected induction of biomarkers of oxidative stress. These include inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and formation of oxidative DNA damage in the brain. DNA damage is likely to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and progression of brain injury. In the search for strategies to attenuate the smoke-initiated brain injury, we produced a transgenic mouse overexpressing the neuronal globin protein neuroglobin. Neuroglobin was neuroprotective in diverse models of ischemic/hypoxic/toxic brain injuries. Here, we report lesser inhibition of respiratory complex I and reduced formation of smoke-induced DNA damage in neuroglobin transgenic compared to wild-type mouse brain. DNA damage was assessed using the standard comet assay, as well as a modified comet assay done in conjunction with an enzyme that excises oxidized guanines that form readily under conditions of oxidative stress. Both comet assays revealed that overexpressed neuroglobin attenuates the formation of oxidative DNA damage, in vivo, in the brain. These findings suggest that elevated neuroglobin exerts neuroprotection, in part, by decreasing the impact of acute smoke inhalation on the integrity of neuronal DNA. labels: #Globins'
b'Protoglobin is the first globin found in Archaea. Its biological role is still unknown, although this protein can bind O(2), CO, and NO reversibly in vitro. The X-ray structure of Methanosarcina acetivorans protoglobin (MaPgb) has shown that access of ligands to the heme, which is completely buried within the protein matrix, can be granted by two apolar tunnels, which are mainly defined by helices G and B (tunnel 1), and helices B and E (tunnel 2). Here we analyze the structural and dynamical behavior of MaPgb through molecular dynamics and computational techniques aimed at shedding light on distinctive features of ligand migration through the tunnels that may be linked to functionality. While tunnel 2 is found to be accessible to diatomic ligands in both deoxygenated and oxygenated forms of the protein, the accessibility of tunnel 1 is controlled through the synergistic effect of both the protein dimeric state and the presence of the heme-bound ligand. Thus, dimerization mainly affects the spatial arrangement of helix G, which influences the shape of tunnel 1. Ligand accessibility through this tunnel is regulated by Phe(145)G8, which can adopt open and closed conformations. Noteworthy, the ratio between open and closed states is modulated by protein dimerization and more strikingly by ligand binding. In particular, sensing of the ligand is mediated by Phe(93)E11, and the steric hindrance between Phe(93)E11 and the heme-bound ligand alters the structural and dynamical behavior of helices B and E, which facilitates opening of tunnel 1. This functional mechanism provides a basis to understand the finding that ligation favors fast rebinding from ligand binding kinetic to MaPgb. Finally, it also suggests that MaPgb might be physiologically involved in a ligand-controlled bimolecular chemical process. labels: #Globins'
b'We have previously shown that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) triggers irreversible oxidation of amino acids exclusive to the \xce\xb2-chains of purified human hemoglobin (HbAo). However, it is not clear, whether \xce\xb1- or \xce\xb2-subunit Hb variants exhibit different oxidative resistance to H(2)O(2) when compared to their native HbAo. Hb Providence contains two \xce\xb2-subunit variants with single amino acid mutations at \xce\xb2Lys82\xe2\x86\x92Asp (\xce\xb2K82D) and at \xce\xb2Lys82\xe2\x86\x92Asn (\xce\xb2K82N) positions and binds oxygen at lower affinity than wild type HbA. We have separated Hb Providence into its 3 component fractions, and contrasted oxidative reactions of its \xce\xb2-mutant fractions with HbAo. Relative to HbAo, both \xce\xb2K82N and \xce\xb2K82D fractions showed similar autoxidation kinetics and similar initial oxidation reaction rates with H(2)O(2). However, a more profound pattern of changes was seen in HbAo than in the two Providence fractions. The structural changes in HbAo include a collapse of \xce\xb2-subunits, and \xce\xb1-\xce\xb1 dimer formation in the presence of excess H(2)O(2). Mass spectrometric and amino acid analysis revealed that \xce\xb2Cys93 and \xce\xb2Cys112 were oxidized in the HbAo fraction, consistent with oxidative pathways driven by a ferrylHb and its protein radical. These amino acids were oxidized at a lesser extent in \xce\xb2K82D fraction. While the 3 isolated components of Hb Providence exhibited similar ligand binding and oxidation reaction kinetics, the variant fractions were more effective in consuming H(2)O(2) and safely internalizing radicals through the ferric/ferryl pseudoperoxidase cycle. labels: #Globins'
b'In heme-based sensor proteins, ligand binding to heme in a sensor domain induces conformational changes that eventually lead to changes in enzymatic activity of an associated catalytic domain. The bacterial oxygen sensor FixL is the best-studied example of these proteins and displays marked differences in dynamic behavior with respect to model globin proteins. We report a mid-IR study of the configuration and ultrafast dynamics of CO in the distal heme pocket site of the sensor PAS domain FixLH, employing a recently developed method that provides a unique combination of high spectral resolution and range and high sensitivity. Anisotropy measurements indicate that CO rotates toward the heme plane upon dissociation, as is the case in globins. Remarkably, CO bound to the heme iron is tilted by ~30\xc2\xb0 with respect to the heme normal, which contrasts to the situation in myoglobin and in present FixLH-CO X-ray crystal structure models. This implies protein-environment-induced strain on the ligand, which is possibly at the origin of a very rapid docking-site population in a single conformation. Our observations likely explain the unusually low affinity of FixL for CO that is at the origin of the weak ligand discrimination between CO and O(2). Moreover, we observe orders of magnitude faster vibrational relaxation of dissociated CO in FixL than in globins, implying strong interactions of the ligand with the distal heme pocket environment. Finally, in the R220H FixLH mutant protein, where CO is H-bonded to a distal histidine, we demonstrate that the H-bond is maintained during photolysis. Comparison with extensively studied globin proteins unveils a surprisingly rich variety in both structural and dynamic properties of the interaction of a diatomic ligand with the ubiquitous b-type heme-proximal histidine system in different distal pockets. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (NGB), a newly discovered member of the globin superfamily, may regulate neuronal survival under hypoxia or oxidative stress. Although NGB is greatly expressed in retinal neurons, the biological functions of NGB in retinal diseases remain largely unknown. We investigated the role of NGB in an experimental model of glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disorder that usually involves elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is thought to induce oxidative stress in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), thereby causing RGC death and, eventually, blindness. We found that NGB plays a critical role in increasing RGC resistance to ocular hypertension and glaucomatous damage. Elevation of IOP stimulated a transient up-regulation of endogenous NGB in RGCs. Constitutive overexpression of NGB in transgenic mice prevented RGC damage induced by glutamate cytotoxicity in vitro and/or by chronic IOP elevation in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of NGB attenuated ocular hypertension-induced superoxide production and the associated decrease in ATP levels in mice, suggesting that NGB acts as an endogenous neuroprotectant to reduce oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial function, thereby promoting RGC survival. Thus, NGB may modulate RGC susceptibility to glaucomatous neural damage. Manipulating the expression and bioactivity of NGB may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for glaucoma. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin protects neurons from hypoxia in vitro and in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms for this effect remain poorly understood. Most of the neuroglobin is present in a hexacoordinate state with proximal and distal histidines in the heme pocket directly bound to the heme iron. At equilibrium, the concentration of the five-coordinate neuroglobin remains very low (0.1-5%). Recent studies have shown that post-translational redox regulation of neuroglobin surface thiol disulfide formation increases the open probability of the heme pocket and allows nitrite binding and reaction to form NO. We hypothesized that the equilibrium between the six- and five-coordinate states and secondary reactions with nitrite to form NO could be regulated by other hypoxia-dependent post-translational modification(s). Protein sequence models identified candidate sites for both 14-3-3 binding and phosphorylation. In both in vitro experiments and human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells exposed to hypoxia and glucose deprivation, we observed that 1) neuroglobin phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions with 14-3-3 increase during hypoxic and metabolic stress; 2) neuroglobin binding to 14-3-3 stabilizes and increases the half-life of phosphorylation; and 3) phosphorylation increases the open probability of the heme pocket, which increases ligand binding (CO and nitrite) and accelerates the rate of anaerobic nitrite reduction to form NO. These data reveal a series of hypoxia-dependent post-translational modifications to neuroglobin that regulate the six-to-five heme pocket equilibrium and heme access to ligands. Hypoxia-regulated reactions of nitrite and neuroglobin may contribute to the cellular adaptation to hypoxia. labels: #Globins'
b'It has been hypothesized that two successive rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) in the stem lineage of vertebrates provided genetic raw materials for the evolutionary innovation of many vertebrate-specific features. However, it has seldom been possible to trace such innovations to specific functional differences between paralogous gene products that derive from a WGD event. Here, we report genomic evidence for a direct link between WGD and key physiological innovations in the vertebrate oxygen transport system. Specifically, we demonstrate that key globin proteins that evolved specialized functions in different aspects of oxidative metabolism (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytoglobin) represent paralogous products of two WGD events in the vertebrate common ancestor. Analysis of conserved macrosynteny between the genomes of vertebrates and amphioxus (subphylum Cephalochordata) revealed that homologous chromosomal segments defined by myoglobin + globin-E, cytoglobin, and the \xce\xb1-globin gene cluster each descend from the same linkage group in the reconstructed proto-karyotype of the chordate common ancestor. The physiological division of labor between the oxygen transport function of hemoglobin and the oxygen storage function of myoglobin played a pivotal role in the evolution of aerobic energy metabolism, supporting the hypothesis that WGDs helped fuel key innovations in vertebrate evolution. labels: #Globins'
b'The proximal side of dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin A (DHP A) from Amphitrite ornata has been modified via site-directed mutagenesis of methionine 86 into aspartate (M86D) to introduce an Asp-His-Fe triad charge relay. X-ray crystallographic structure determination of the metcyano forms of M86D [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry  3MYN ] and M86E (PDB entry  3MYM ) mutants reveal the structural origins of a stable catalytic triad in DHP A. A decrease in the rate of H(2)O(2) activation as well as a lowered reduction potential versus that of the wild-type enzyme was observed in M86D. One possible explanation for the significantly lower activity is an increased affinity for the distal histidine in binding to the heme Fe to form a bis-histidine adduct. Resonance Raman spectroscopy demonstrates a pH-dependent ligation by the distal histidine in M86D, which is indicative of an increased trans effect. At pH 5.0, the heme Fe is five-coordinate, and this structure resembles the wild-type DHP A resting state. However, at pH 7.0, the distal histidine appears to form a six-coordinate ferric bis-histidine (hemichrome) adduct. These observations can be explained by the effect of the increased positive charge on the heme Fe on the formation of a six-coordinate low-spin adduct, which inhibits the ligation and activation of H(2)O(2) as required for peroxidase activity. The results suggest that the proximal charge relay in peroxidases regulate the redox potential of the heme Fe but that the trans effect is a carefully balanced property that can both activate H(2)O(2) and attract ligation by the distal histidine. To understand the balance of forces that modulate peroxidase reactivity, we studied three M86 mutants, M86A, M86D, and M86E, by spectroelectrochemistry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of (13)C- and (15)N-labeled cyanide adducts as probes of the redox potential and of the trans effect in the heme Fe, both of which can be correlated with the proximity of negative charge to the N(\xce\xb4) hydrogen of the proximal histidine, consistent with an Asp-His-Fe charge relay observed in heme peroxidases. labels: #Globins'
b'The family of vertebrate globins includes hemoglobin, myoglobin, and other O(2)-binding proteins of yet unclear functions. Among these, globin X is restricted to fish and amphibians. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) globin X is expressed at low levels in neurons of the central nervous system and appears to be associated with the sensory system. The protein harbors a unique N-terminal extension with putative N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation sites, suggesting membrane-association. Intracellular localization and transport of globin X was studied in 3T3 cells employing green fluorescence protein fusion constructs. Both myristoylation and palmitoylation sites are required for correct targeting and membrane localization of globin X. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a vertebrate globin has been identified as component of the cell membrane. Globin X has a hexacoordinate binding scheme and displays cooperative O(2) binding with a variable affinity (P(50)\xe2\x88\xbc1.3-12.5 torr), depending on buffer conditions. A respiratory function of globin X is unlikely, but analogous to some prokaryotic membrane-globins it may either protect the lipids in cell membrane from oxidation or may act as a redox-sensing or signaling protein. labels: #Globins'
b"Hell's Gate globin I (HGbI), a heme-containing protein structurally homologous to mammalian neuroglobins, has been identified from an acidophilic and thermophilic obligate methanotroph, Methylacidiphilum infernorum. HGbI has very high affinity for O(2) and shows barely detectable autoxidation in the pH range of 5.2-8.6 and temperature range of 25-50\xc2\xb0C. Examination of the heme pocket by X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics showed that conformational movements of Tyr29(B10) and Gln50(E7), as well as structural flexibility of the GH loop and H-helix, may play a role in modulating its ligand binding behavior. Bacterial HGbI's unique resistance to the sort of extreme acidity that would extract heme from any other hemoglobin makes it an ideal candidate for comparative structure-function studies of the expanding globin superfamily. labels: #Globins"
b'Neuroglobin (NGB) is a recently discovered globin, which is widely expressed in vertebrates central and peripheral nervous systems. Previous studies have shown that NGB is important in protecting neurons from hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries. However, there are no reports on the neuroprotective effects of NGB after mechanical injury. Currently, we showed that the NGB expression level in neurons increased continuously from 2 h after injury, and reached a peak at 16 h (p<0.01), after which it decreased sharply. NGB that was overexpressed in mechanically injured B104 cells showed significant neuroprotective effects. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity decreased and cell survival rates increased (p<0.01, n=5). In the rat model of focal brain trauma, the NGB expression increased sharply at 1 h, after which it increased continuously until it reached a peak at 6 h, and then gradually decreased (p<0.01, n=5). Furthermore, moderate and severe injury resulted in significantly higher NGB levels than did mild injury (p<0.01, n=5). Our results indicate that NGB exerts significant neuroprotective effects after mechanical injury, and thus has important implications for the prognosis and cure of traumatic brain injury. labels: #Globins'
b'The purpose of the present work is to study the vacuum ultraviolet radiation action on the optical and chromatographic characteristics of human hemoglobin molecules and their components - haem and globin. Using the methods of spectrophotometry and thin layer chromatography (TLC), we have investigated into the structural changes of molecules of human hemoglobin, haem and globin, induced by the influence of vacuum UV light (gamma = 118-134 nm, dose - 1.2 kJ/m2). It has been shown that vacuum ultraviolet radiation induces an infringement of the higher types of the spatial organization ofglobin molecules, thus leading to the changes in the structural state of the albuminous globule. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Microarray-based gene expression analysis of peripheral whole blood is a common strategy in the development of clinically relevant biomarker panels for a variety of human diseases. However, the results of such an analysis are often plagued by decreased sensitivity and reliability due to the effects of relatively high levels of globin mRNA in whole blood. Globin reduction assays have been shown to overcome such effects, but they require large amounts of total RNA and may induce distinct gene expression profiles. The Illumina whole genome DASL assay can detect gene expression levels using partially degraded RNA samples and has the potential to detect rare transcripts present in highly heterogeneous whole blood samples without the need for globin reduction. We assessed the utility of the whole genome DASL assay in an analysis of peripheral whole blood gene expression profiles.RESULTS: We find that gene expression detection is significantly increased with the use of whole genome DASL compared to the standard IVT-based direct hybridization. Additionally, globin-probe negative whole genome DASL did not exhibit significant improvements over globin-probe positive whole genome DASL. Globin reduction further increases the detection sensitivity and reliability of both whole genome DASL and IVT-based direct hybridization with little effect on raw intensity correlations. Raw intensity correlations between total RNA and globin reduced RNA were 0.955 for IVT-based direct hybridization and 0.979 for whole genome DASL.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the detection sensitivity of the whole genome DASL assay is higher than the IVT-based direct hybridization assay, with or without globin reduction, and should be considered in conjunction with globin reduction methods for future blood-based gene expression studies. labels: #Globins'
b'The molecular mechanisms underlying erythroid-specific gene regulation remain incompletely understood. Closely spaced binding sites for GATA, NF-E2/maf, and CACCC interacting transcription factors play functionally important roles in globin and other erythroid-specific gene expression. We and others recently identified the CACCC-binding transcription factor ZBP-89 as a novel GATA-1 and NF-E2/mafK interacting partner. Here, we examined the role of ZBP-89 in human globin gene regulation and erythroid maturation using a primary CD34(+) cell ex vivo differentiation system. We show that ZBP-89 protein levels rise dramatically during human erythroid differentiation and that ZBP-89 occupies key cis-regulatory elements within the globin and other erythroid gene loci. ZBP-89 binding correlates strongly with RNA Pol II occupancy, active histone marks, and high-level gene expression. ZBP-89 physically associates with the histone acetyltransferases p300 and Gcn5/Trrap, and occupies common sites with Gcn5 within the human globin loci. Lentiviral short hairpin RNAs knockdown of ZBP-89 results in reduced Gcn5 occupancy, decreased acetylated histone 3 levels, lower globin and erythroid-specific gene expression, and impaired erythroid maturation. Addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid partially reverses the reduced globin gene expression. These findings reveal an activating role for ZBP-89 in human globin gene regulation and erythroid differentiation. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin, generated using genetic engineering method, is a kind of recombinant human stellate cell activation-associated protein. We speculate that it could influence the development of hepatic fibrosis like Sellate cell activation-associated protein which was discovered by Kawada et al. Therefore, we investigated its anti-fibrosis effect on liver both in vivo and in vitro. During our research, we found that cytoglobin showed obvious effect compared with the control group on Thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis in SD rats, including significantly decrease in aspartate aminotransferase, Hyaluronic acid, laminin and collagen I(Col I) levels in serum and hydroxyproline in livers, which are the important indices reflecting the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Meanwhile, the viability of rat hepatic stellate cell line T6 (HSC-T6) cells was inhibited by cytoglobin and the apoptosis induced by cytoglobin in HSC-T6 cells was detected by Annexin V/PI double staining. Activation of the caspase cascade including caspase-3 for the intrinsic pathways was demonstrated. The results also showed that the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased whereas that of Bax protein increased, leading to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Our results demonstrated that cytoglobin exhibited anti-fibrosis activity on livers in vivo and in vitro, involving apoptosis induction. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Lens epithelium-derived growth factor p75 (LEDGF/p75) is a stress survival transcription co-activator and autoantigen that is overexpressed in tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). This oncoprotein promotes resistance to cell death induced by oxidative stress and chemotherapy by mechanisms that remain unclear. To get insights into these mechanisms we identified candidate target stress genes of LEDGF/p75 using pathway-specific gene expression profiling in PCa cells.METHODS: A "Human oxidative stress and antioxidant defense" qPCR array was used to identify genes exhibiting significant expression changes in response to knockdown or overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PC-3 cells. Validation of array results was performed by additional qPCR and immunoblotting.RESULTS: Cytoglobin (CYGB), Phosphoinositide-binding protein PIP3-E/IPCEF-1, superoxidase dismutase 3 (SOD3), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and albumin (ALB) exhibited significant transcript down- and up-regulation in response to LEDGF/p75 knockdown and overexpression, respectively. CYGB gene was selected for further validation based on its emerging role as a stress oncoprotein in human malignancies. In light of previous reports indicating that LEDGF/p75 regulates peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), and that PRDXs exhibit differential expression in PCa, we also examined the relationship between these proteins in PCa cells. Our validation data revealed that changes in LEDGF/p75 transcript and protein expression in PCa cells closely paralleled those of CYGB, but not those of the PRDXs.CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies CYGB and other genes as stress genes potentially regulated by LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells, and provides a rationale for investigating their role in PCa and in promoting resistance to chemotherapy- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. labels: #Globins'
b'To evaluate a potential insult in the cerebellum of pups exposed to maternal epileptic seizures during intrauterine life, female rats were subjected to pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Pups from different litters were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-natal days (PN) and neuroglobin (Ngb) and gliosis were analyzed in the cerebellum by Western blotting (WB) and RT-PCR. (14)C-l-leucine-[(14)C-Leu] incorporation was used to analyze protein synthesis at PN1. Nitric Oxide (NO) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels were also measured. Pups from naive mothers were used as controls. The mRNA level of Ngb was increased in experimental animals at PN1 ((**)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.001) and PN3 ((**)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.001), at PN7 ((***)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.0001) and at PN14 ((**)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.001) compared to the respective controls. The protein level of Ngb increased significantly in the experimental pups at PN1 ((*)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05) and at PN3 ((**)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.001), when compared to the control pups at PN1 and PN3. At PN7 and PN14 no difference was found. The mRNA level of GFAP increased significantly about two times at PN3 ((*)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05) and PN7 ((*)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05) in the experimental pups when compared to the respective controls, but was unchanged in the other studied ages. Data showed that experimental pups at PN1 exhibited reduced (about 2 times, (*)p \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05) total protein synthesis in the cerebellum when compared to control. No differences were found in the NO and TBARS levels. Our data support the hypothesis that an up-regulation of Ngb could be a compensatory mechanism in response to the hypoxic-ischemic insults caused by seizures in pups during intrauterine life. labels: #Globins'
b"To investigate the mechanisms of the therapeutic action and drug resistance to the nitrogen mustard melphalan, melphalan-induced DNA damage repair and chromatin structure were examined along the p53, N-ras and d-globin gene loci in cells carrying different repair activities. In nucleotide excision repair-deficient XP-A cells, similar levels of adducts were found in all fragments examined, indicating uniform distribution of DNA damage. In both, repair-proficient CS-B and XP-C cells, faster repair was observed in regions inside the transcribed N-ras and p53 genes, compared to regions on both sides outside of the genes, while no such difference was observed for the inactive d-globin gene. Moreover, very fast adduct repair on the transcribed strand of the active genes was seen immediately downstream of the transcription start site, together with a steeply decreasing gradient of repair efficiency along the gene towards the 3'-end. In all cells analyzed, the above variation in DNA repair efficiency was paralleled exactly by the variation in the degree of local chromatin condensation, more relaxed chromatin being associated with faster repair. Similar results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers, suggesting that the existence of a repair gradient along transcribed genes may be a universal phenomenon. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the repair of melphalan adducts in the transcribed strand of active genes is subject to a strong polarity effect arising from variations in the chromatin structure. labels: #Globins"
b"Thalassaemia is characterized by the reduced or absent production of globins in the haemoglobin molecule leading to imbalanced \xce\xb1-globin/non \xce\xb1-globin chains. HbE, the result of a G to A mutation in codon 26 of the HBB (\xce\xb2-globin) gene, activates a cryptic 5' splice site in codon 25 leading to a reduction of correctly spliced \xce\xb2(E) -globin (HBB:c.79G>A) mRNA and consequently \xce\xb2(+) -thalassaemia. A wide range of clinical severities in both\xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-thalassaemia syndromes, from nearly asymptomatic to transfusion-dependent, has been observed. The correlation between clinical heterogeneity in various genotypes of thalassaemia and the levels of globin gene expression and \xce\xb2(E) -globin pre-mRNA splicing were examined using multiplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and allele-specific RT-qPCR. The \xce\xb1-globin/non \xce\xb1-globin mRNA ratio was demonstrated to be a good indicator for disease severity among different thalassaemia disorders. However, the \xce\xb1-globin/non \xce\xb1-globin mRNA ratio ranged widely in \xce\xb2-thalassaemia/HbE patients, with no significant difference between mild and severe phenotypes. Interestingly, the correctly to aberrantly spliced \xce\xb2(E) -globin mRNA ratio in 30% of mild \xce\xb2-thalassaemia/HbE patients was higher than that of the severe patients. The splicing process of \xce\xb2(E) -globin pre-mRNA differs among \xce\xb2-thalassaemia/HbE patients and serves as one of the modifying factors for disease severity. labels: #Globins"
b'The N-terminal valine adduct (HETE-Val) in globin is believed to behave as a long-lived biomarker after exposure to sulfur mustard (HD). Development of a highly sensitive method for monitoring HETE-Val, particularly at low HD exposure levels or for retrospective detection, would be a significant achievement. In this study, by improving the sample preparation method, a sensitive NCI-GC/MS method was established for the analysis of HETE-Val in globin after HD exposure. To optimize and investigate the sample preparation method, all the relevant HETE-Val chemicals were synthesized, purified, and characterized. By carrying out optimized solid phase extraction (SPE) cleanup followed by modified Edman degradation results in a low detection level and clean baseline. The minimum detectable exposure level of human blood (in vitro) to HD is 20 nmol/L (S/N>3). The interday and intraday precisions of the proposed method were found to be acceptable with less than a 15% relative standard deviation (RSD). A nearly linear dose-effect relationship was observed between HETE-Val and a HD exposure concentration range of 0.1-120 \xce\xbcmol/L. The percentage of HD that reacted with N-terminal valine in globin obtained from human blood (in vitro) was quantified using the proposed method. labels: #Globins'
b"We reported previously that Notch signaling is activated in human arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and that intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in humans is accompanied by increased neurogenesis. The former phenomenon may be involved in AVM pathogenesis and the latter in the brain's response to ICH-induced injury. Here we describe increased expression of the hypoxia-inducible neuroprotective protein, neuroglobin (Ngb), in neurons surrounding unruptured AVMs and in the perihematomal region adjacent to ICH. In these disorders, as in other clinical settings, such as ischemic stroke, AVM- and ICH-induced overexpression of Ngb may be stimulated by ischemic hypoxia and may help to constrain brain injury. labels: #Globins"
b"The function of neuroglobin, a member of the vertebrate globin family, is still unknown. In human neuroglobin (NGB), the formation of a disulfide bridge between the CysCD7 and CysD5 is known to affect the heme environment and its ligand-binding kinetics. Here, we show by means of EPR that the PheB10 residue plays a key role in transmitting the structural information from the disulfide bridge to the heme-pocket region. While formation of a disulfide bridge in ferric wild-type NGB leads to a considerable change of its EPR parameters, only minor changes are observed in the case of ferric PheB10Leu NGB. Furthermore, wild-type NGB is found to be much more stable in the presence of H(2)O(2) than its PheB10Leu or its HisE7Leu mutants. While tyrosyl radicals are induced in HisE7Leu NGB by the addition of H(2)O(2), this is not the case for wild-type and PheB10Leu NGB. The results will be discussed in terms of the protein's putative functions. labels: #Globins"
b'If rates of postduplication gene retention are positively correlated with levels of functional constraint, then gene duplicates that have been retained in a restricted number of taxonomic lineages would be expected to exhibit relatively low levels of sequence conservation. Paradoxical patterns are presented by gene duplicates that have been retained in a small number of taxa but which are nonetheless subject to strong purifying selection relative to paralogous members of the same multigene family. This pattern suggests that such genes may have been co-opted for novel, lineage-specific functions. One possible example involves the enigmatic globin-E gene (GbE), which appears to be exclusively restricted to birds. Available data indicate that this gene is expressed exclusively in the avian eye, but its physiological function remains a mystery. In contrast to the highly restricted phyletic distribution of GbE, the overwhelming majority of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) possess copies of the related cytoglobin (Cygb) and myoglobin (Mb) genes. The purpose of the present study was 1) to assess the phyletic distribution of the Cygb, Mb, and GbE genes among vertebrates, 2) to elucidate the duplicative origins and evolutionary histories of these three genes, and 3) to evaluate the relative levels of functional constraint of these genes based on comparative sequence analysis. To accomplish these objectives, we conducted a combined phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis involving taxa that represent each of the major lineages of gnathostome vertebrates. Results of synteny comparisons and phylogenetic topology tests revealed that GbE is clearly not the product of a recent, bird-specific duplication event. Instead, GbE originated via duplication of a proto-Mb gene in the stem lineage of gnathostomes. Unlike the Mb gene, which has been retained in all major gnathostome lineages other than amphibians, the GbE gene has been retained only in the lineage leading to modern birds and has been independently lost in at least four major lineages: teleost fish, amphibians, mammals, and nonavian reptiles. Despite the restricted phyletic distribution of this gene, our results indicate that GbE is one of the most highly conserved globins in the avian genome. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a recently discovered vertebrate globin with molecular characteristics that are similar to myoglobin. To study the biological function of Cygb in vivo, we generated Cygb knockout mice and investigated their susceptibility to N,N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced tumorigenesis. Four-week-old male mice were administered DEN in drinking water at a dose of 25 ppm for 25 weeks or 0.05 ppm for 36 weeks. Cygb deficiency promoted the DEN-induced development of liver and lung tumors. All Cygb(+/-) and Cygb(-/-) mice treated with 25-ppm DEN exhibited liver tumors, compared with 44.4% of their wild-type counterparts. Lung tumors were present only in Cygb-deficient mice. More than 40% of Cygb(-/-) mice developed liver and lung tumors at the nontoxic dose of DEN (0.05 ppm), which did not induce tumors in wild-type mice. Cygb loss was associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, elevated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt activation, overexpression of IL-1\xce\xb2, IL-6, Tnf\xce\xb1, and Tgf\xce\xb23 mRNAs, and hepatic collagen accumulation. Cygb-deficient mice also exhibited increased nitrotyrosine formation and dysregulated expression of cancer-related genes (cyclin D2, p53, Pak1, Src, Cdkn2a, and Cebpa). These results suggest that Cygb deficiency induces susceptibility to cancer development in the liver and lungs of mice exposed to DEN. Thus, globins such as Cygb will shed new light on the biological features of organ carcinogenesis. labels: #Globins'
b'Caenorhabditis elegans globin GLB-26 (expressed from gene T22C1.2) has been studied in comparison with human neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb) for its electron transfer properties. GLB-26 exhibits no reversible binding for O(2) and a relatively low CO affinity compared to myoglobin-like globins. These differences arise from its mechanism of gaseous ligand binding since the heme iron of GLB-26 is strongly hexacoordinated in the absence of external ligands; the replacement of this internal ligand, probably the E7 distal histidine, is required before binding of CO or O(2) as for Ngb and Cygb. Interestingly the ferrous bis-histidyl GLB-26 and Ngb, another strongly hexacoordinated globin, can transfer an electron to cytochrome c (Cyt-c) at a high bimolecular rate, comparable to those of inter-protein electron transfer in mitochondria. In addition, GLB-26 displays an unexpectedly rapid oxidation of the ferrous His-Fe-His complex without O(2) actually binding to the iron atom, since the heme is oxidized by O(2) faster than the time for distal histidine dissociation. These efficient mechanisms for electron transfer could indicate a family of hexacoordinated globin which are functionally different from that of pentacoordinated globins. labels: #Globins'
b'In order to update the molecular basis of \xce\xb2-thalassemia and describe hematological features among different mutations and the concurrent of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-thalassemias, 849 unrelated \xce\xb2-thalassemia heterozygotes recruited in northeast Thailand during a prevention and control program were studied. \xce\xb2- and \xce\xb1-thalassemia mutations were investigated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies and hematological parameters were recorded using standard methods. Seventeen different mutations including both \xce\xb2(0)- and \xce\xb2(+) -thalassemias were identified. Eight of these 17 \xce\xb2-thalassemia alleles accounted for 97.4%, others were found at lower frequencies (<1.0%). Of the 849 cases, 626 were investigated for common \xce\xb1-thalassemia mutations and 155 (24.8%) were found to be co-inherited with different forms of \xce\xb1-thalassemia. Comparison of the hematological parameters among different \xce\xb2-thalassemia mutations revealed an increasing trend of MCV and MCH in a group of heterozygous states for the 3.4kb deletion and the A-G substitution at nucleotide (NT) -28. Hb A(2) and Hb F levels in individuals with the 3.4kb deletion were significantly higher than those with other mutations. Interaction of each \xce\xb2-thalassemia mutation with \xce\xb1-thalassemia did not affect the diagnostic ranges of Hb A(2) and Hb F, though the significantly increased MCV and MCH was noted. These findings underline the heterogeneity of \xce\xb2-thalassemia and the importance of hematological and molecular analyses of both \xce\xb1-and \xce\xb2-thalassemias in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of the couples at-risk of having babies with severe thalassemia diseases in the region. labels: #Globins'
b"Globins are respiratory proteins involved in oxygen metabolism, which is a critical factor in tumor growth and progression. The status of neuroglobin and myoglobin is largely unknown in human malignancies, including lung cancer. The aim of this study was to explore mRNA expression profiles, potential regulatory mechanisms and clinicopathological associations of neuroglobin and myoglobin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We screened 208 surgically resected NSCLC specimens and a panel of lung normal and cancer cell lines. The mRNA expression of neuroglobin, myoglobin and hypoxia markers (HIF1\xce\xb1 and VEGFa) was measured with qRTPCR, while neuroglobin promoter methylation was assessed with Pyrosequencing. Neuroglobin and myoglobin were upregulated in the tumor samples compared to normal tissue (p=1.3\xc3\x9710(-22) and p=1.9\xc3\x9710(-9), respectively). Neuroglobin was more frequently overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCL) than adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of myoglobin was more profound in adenocarcinomas, which correlated with poor survival (p=0.013). Neuroglobin promoter was hypermethylated in 30.8% of NSCLC cases, which correlated with neuroglobin mRNA downregulation. The epigenetic regulation of neuroglobin was confirmed by treating lung cell lines with 5'azadeoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A. Expression of both genes correlated with the expression of HIF1\xce\xb1 (neuroglobin: p=3.8\xc3\x9710(-5), myoglobin: p=1.1\xc3\x9710(-11)). Myoglobin expression was also associated to that of VEGFa (p=2.1\xc3\x9710(-7)). Hypoxia-dependent upregulation of both globins was validated in vitro. In summary, neuroglobin and myoglobin overexpression in NSCLC is associated with histological subtype, hypoxia and, in case of neuroglobin - epigenetic regulation. Myoglobin expression may have potential significance in the prognostication of lung adenocarcinomas. labels: #Globins"
b'Cytoglobin is a recently identified vertebrate globin whose functions include scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrosative species. In tumor cells, CYGB may function as a tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that knockdown of cytoglobin expression can sensitize human glioma cells to oxidative stress induced by chemical inhibitors of the electron transport chain and as well can increase cellular radiosensitivity. When treated with antimycin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytoglobin-deficient cells showed significantly higher H\xe2\x82\x82O\xe2\x82\x82 levels, whereas H\xe2\x82\x82O\xe2\x82\x82 levels were significantly reduced in cytoglobin-overexpressing cells. In addition, cytoglobin knockdown significantly decreased the doubling time of glioma cell lines, consistent with a putative tumor suppressor function. These finding suggest that modulating cytoglobin levels may be a promising treatment strategy for sensitizing human glioma cells to oxidative stress that is induced by ionizing radiation, certain chemotherapies and ischemia-reperfusion. labels: #Globins'
b'The visual process in the vertebrate eye requires high amounts of metabolic energy and thus oxygen. Oxygen supply of the avian retina is a challenging task because birds have large eyes, thick retinae, and high metabolic rates but neither deep retinal nor superficial capillaries. Respiratory proteins such as myoglobin may enhance oxygen supply to certain tissues, and thus the mammalian retina harbors high amounts of neuroglobin. Globin E (GbE) was recently identified as an eye-specific globin of chicken (Gallus gallus). Orthologous GbE genes were found in zebra finch and turkey genomes but appear to be absent in non-avian vertebrate classes. Analyses of globin phylogeny and gene synteny showed an ancient origin of GbE but did not help to assign it to any specific globin type. We show that the photoreceptor cells of the chicken retina have a high level of GbE protein, which accumulates to \xe2\x88\xbc10 \xce\xbcM in the total eye. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed an \xe2\x88\xbc50,000-fold higher level of GbE mRNA in the eye than in the brain. Spectroscopic analysis and ligand binding kinetics of recombinant chicken GbE reveal a penta-coordinated globin with an oxygen affinity of P(50) = 5.8 torrs at 25 \xc2\xb0C and 15 torrs at 41 \xc2\xb0C. Together these data suggest that GbE helps to sustain oxygen supply to the avian retina. labels: #Globins'
b'Respiratory proteins are responsible for transport and storage of oxygen. It is well established that specific requirements for oxygen during vertebrate ontogeny cause switches of hemoglobin chain expression. Here, we characterize the developmental profiles of zebrafish (Danio rerio) globins by means of quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The total mRNA levels of the hemoglobin chains, including a newly identified embryonic \xce\xb1-chain, as well as myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin 1 and 2, and globin X were estimated. mRNAs of all globins were detectable in unfertilized eggs, suggesting maternal storage. Embryonic \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-hemoglobin mRNA peaked at hatching and the switch to adult hemoglobin expression occurred 16\xc2\xa0dpf. Enhanced myoglobin mRNA levels were detected ~31\xc2\xa0h post-fertilization (hpf), coinciding with the heart and the muscle development, while neuroglobin mRNA expression pattern correlates with the formation of the nervous system. Amounts of myoglobin and neuroglobin mRNA were similar within an order of magnitude throughout the ontogeny, tentatively supporting a respiratory role of neuroglobin. Cytoglobin 2 mRNA levels increased gradually, whereas cytoglobin 1 mRNA levels increased strongly after ~31\xc2\xa0hpf, which is in agreement with a function in cell proliferation. Globin X mRNA level was highest in oocytes, but low in later stages. Together, these data suggest a specific role for each globin, which are also associated with certain events in fish development. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS), a common inherited hemolytic anemia characterized by decreased deformability, reduced surface to volume ratio, and increased osmotic fragility of the spheroidal erythrocytes, is associated with several mutations of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, band 4.2. HS manifests itself with high degrees of clinical heterogeneity and the molecular events leading to premature hemolysis of the spherocytes are unclear. We have employed proteomic techniques to identify differentially regulated proteins in the membrane and hemoglobin-depleted cytosol of HS erythrocytes.METHODS: We have employed 2-D gel electrophoresis and tandem matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry to investigate the differential proteome profiling of membrane and hemoglobin-depleted cytosol of erythrocytes isolated from the peripheral blood samples of HS patients and normal volunteers.RESULTS: Our study showed that redox regulators are up-regulated; while a co-chaperone and a nucleotide kinase are down-regulated in HS erythrocyte cytosol. We observed elevated levels of membrane-associated globin chains and low-molecular weight fragments of several major cytoskeletal proteins.CONCLUSION: The observed changes in the erythrocyte proteomes indicate altered redox regulation, nucleotide metabolism, protein aggregation and/or degradation, cytoskeletal disorganization, and severe oxidative stress in HS. Taken together, this study could enlighten upon disease progression and pathophysiology of HS. labels: #Globins'
b'The internal cavity matrix of globins plays a key role in their biological function. Previous studies have already highlighted the plasticity of this inner network, which can fluctuate with the proteins breathing motion, and the importance of a few key residues for the regulation of ligand diffusion within the protein. In this Article, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics and coarse-grain Brownian dynamics to establish a complete mechanical landscape for six different globins chain (myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, truncated hemoglobin, and chains \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2 of hemoglobin). We show that the rigidity profiles of these proteins can fluctuate along time, and how a limited set of residues present specific mechanical properties that are related to their position at the frontier between internal cavities. Eventually, we postulate the existence of conserved positions within the globin fold, which form a mechanical nucleus located at the center of the cavity network, and whose constituent residues are essential for controlling ligand migration in globins. labels: #Globins'
b'Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), valine, isoleucine, and leucine, are widely used among athletes as dietary integrators. Although the occurrence of untoward effects of BCCA supplementation, with particular regard to neurological disturbances, cannot be excluded, no specific studies have been performed so far. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of a diet enriched in BCAAs on the expression of oxidative stress pathway genes in the brain of C57Bl/6J mice. Animals were fed a standard or a BCAA diet for 95 days starting from postnatal day 21 until sacrifice. BCAA treatment, at doses comparable to human usage, significantly down-regulated the expression of some antioxidant genes, while up-regulating the expression of some oxygen transporters. In conclusion, it appears that BCAAs administered by diet could alter some specific oxidative stress pathways in the brain. Caution should thus be exercised in the widespread use of BCAAs as dietary integrators in sports practice. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cgb), the fourth member of the vertebrate heme globin family, is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and reversibly binds to CO, O(2) and other small ligands. The diverse functions of Cgb may include ligand transport, redox reactions and enzymatic catalysis. Recent studies indicate that Cgb is a potential gene medicine for fibrosis and cancer therapy. In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the functionally related structural properties and dynamic characteristics in carboxy and deoxy human Cgb. The simulation results showed that the loop regions and internal cavities were significantly affected through the binding of an exogenous ligand. The AB, GH and EF loops were found to undergo significant rearrangement and this led to distinct cavity adjustments in Xe2, Xe4 and the distal pocket. In addition, solvent accessibility and torsion angle analyses revealed an interactive distal network comprised of His(81)(E7), Leu(46)(B10) and Arg(84)(E10). The MD study of carboxy and deoxy human Cgb revealed that CO-ligated Cgb modulates the protein conformation primarily by loop and cavity rearrangements rather than the heme sliding mechanism found in neuroglobin (Ngb). The significant differences between Cgb and Ngb in the loop and cavity properties are presumably linked to their various biological functions. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently identified member of hemoglobin family, distributed mainly in central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies suggest that Ngb can protect neural cells from \xce\xb2-amyloid-induced toxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylation of tau is another characterized pathological hallmark in the AD brains; however, it is not reported whether Ngb also affects tau phosphorylation. In this study, we found that the level of Ngb was significantly reduced in Tg2576 mice (a recognized mouse model of AD) and TgMAPt mice, and the level of Ngb was negatively correlated with tau phosphorylation. Over-expression of Ngb attenuates tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites induced by up-regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\xce\xb2 (GSK-3\xce\xb2), a crucial tau kinase. While Ngb activates Akt and thus inhibits GSK-3\xce\xb2, simultaneously inhibition of Akt abolishes the effects of Ngb on GSK-3\xce\xb2 inhibition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Our data indicate that Ngb may attenuate tau hyperphosphorylation through activating Akt signaling pathway, implying a therapeutic target for AD. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin/stellate cell activation-associated protein (Cygb/STAP), a hemoprotein, functions as part of an O2 reservoir with protective effects against oxidative stress in hepatic stellate cells. Heterogeneous expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)+ and/or \xce\xb1-smooth muscle actin (\xce\xb1SMA)+ has been noted in subepithelial myofibroblasts and interstitial cells of the same lineage in the colorectum. We have demonstrated that early genomic instability of both epithelial and stromal cells in ulcerative colitis (UC) is important for colorectal tumorigenesis, as well as for mucosal remodeling. To further clarify possible roles of stromal cells in mucosal remodeling and tumor development in UC, we here focused on Cygb expression of subepithelial myofibroblasts and interstitial cells, as well as \xce\xb1SMA and HSP47. Noncancerous mucosa of resected rectae from UC patients with or without colorectal neoplasia (14 and 20 cases, respectively) and of sporadic rectal cancer cases (16) was analyzed immunohistochemically, as well as by immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy. The results, heterogeneous phenotypes of Cygb+, \xce\xb1SMA+ and HSP47+ subepithelial myofibroblasts and interstitial cells, corresponding to rectal stellate cells, were demonstrated. A decrease of Cygb+ subepithelial myofibroblasts and an increase of \xce\xb1SMA+ interstitial cells were significant in UC, as compared to normal rectal mucosa. Furthermore, a decrease of Cygb+ subepithelial myofibroblasts, correlating with \xce\xb1SMA+ and HSP47+ cells, was significant in long-standing UC with neoplasia. In conclusion, there are heterogeneous phenotypes of Cygb+, \xce\xb1SMA+ and HSP47+ subepithelial myofibroblasts and interstitial cells in the rectal mucosa. Mucosal remodeling with alterations of Cygb+ and/or \xce\xb1SMA+/HSP47+ stromal cells might have some relation to UC-associated tumorigenesis. labels: #Globins'
b'The progress of immunoisolation as a treatment for diabetes has been hampered by the diminished long term viability of islets within the immunoisolation device. Chronic hypoxia is greatly responsible for islet cell death within an immunoisolation device and remains an obstacle to the success of this form of islet transplantation. In order to address this problem, isolated rat islets were transfected with a plasmid encoding cytoglobin, an intracellular oxygen binding protein. Untreated or transfected islets were placed in polyacrylonitrile-polyvinychloride hollow fiber and implanted beneath the hepatic capsule in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Fasting blood glucose was used as an indicator of islet survival and function. Rats receiving fibers containing transfected islets remained normoglycemic through the 60 day trial. Untreated islets failed within two weeks after implantation resulting in elevated blood glucose in the recipient. The fibers were recovered and tested for insulin content. Cytoglobin promoted islet cell survival and insulin synthesis and secretion. The induction of cytoglobin in islets may reduce cell loss from chronic hypoxia and may be a useful method to improve the feasibility of immunoisolation as an islet transplantation modality. labels: #Globins'
b'Extensive in silico search of the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans revealed the presence of 33 genes coding for globins that are all transcribed. These globins are very diverse in gene and protein structure and are localized in a variety of cells, mostly neurons. The large number of C. elegans globin genes is assumed to be the result of multiple evolutionary duplication and radiation events. Processes of subfunctionalization and diversification probably led to their cell-specific expression patterns and fixation into the genome. To date, four globins (GLB-1, GLB-5, GLB-6, and GLB-26) have been partially characterized physicochemically, and the crystallographic structure of two of them (GLB-1 and GLB-6) was solved. In this article, a three-dimensional model was designed for the other two globins (GLB-5 and GLB-26), and overlays of the globins were constructed to highlight the structural diversity among them. It is clear that although they all share the globin fold, small variations in the three-dimensional structure have major implications on their ligand-binding properties and possibly their function. We also review here all the information available so far on the globin family of C. elegans and suggest potential functions. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a heme protein, highly conserved along evolution, predominantly found in the nervous system. It is upregulated by hypoxia and ischemia and may have a neuroprotective role under hypoxic stress. Although many other roles have been proposed, the physiological function is still unclear. Antarctic icefishes lack hemoglobin and some species also lack myoglobin, but all have Ngb and thus may help the elucidation of Ngb function. We present the first theoretically derived structure of fish Ngb and describe its behavior using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we sequenced and analyzed Ngbs from a colorless-blooded Antarctic icefish species Chaenocephalus aceratus and a related red-blooded species (Dissostichus mawsoni). Both fish Ngbs are 6-coordinated but have some peculiarities that differentiate them from mammalian counterparts: they have extensions in the N and C termini that can interact with the EF loop, and a gap in the alignment that changes the CD-region structure/dynamics that has been found to play a key role in human neuroglobin. Our results suggest that a single mutation between both fish Ngbs is responsible for significant difference in the behavior of the proteins. The functional role of these characteristics is discussed. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb), a recently found oxygen-binding protein belonging to the vertebrate globin family, is mainly expressed in neurons of brains and eyes. Current studies have revealed diverse potential functions of Ngb and it was found to be able to reduce the severity of stroke and Alzheimer's disease, implying its importance in brains. However, the mechanism of Ngb regulation of transcription has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we analyzed the 5'-flanking region of human neuroglobin gene (NGB) and identified a transcription start site (TSS) located at -306bp relative to the translation start site ATG. We characterized the proximal promoter of NGB and found two GC-boxes located at -16 and +30bp relative to the TSS which are bound by transcription factor Sp1 and Sp3. Mutation of either GC-box led to a significant reduction in NGB promoter activity, while overexpression of Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in activation of the promoter. However, two putative NRSE sites (-359 and -127bp relative to the TSS) apparently showed no influence on NGB tissue-specific expression. Treatment of two non-neuronal cell lines HeLa and BEAS-2B with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine remarkably induced NGB expression, suggesting a potential role of DNA methylation in regulating NGB tissue-specific expression. labels: #Globins"
b'The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of intranasally delivered recombinant human neuronal erythropoietin (Neuro-EPO) on brain injury induced by unilateral permanent ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil. Expression of EPO receptor (EPOR) and neuroglobin (Ngb) over 5 weeks after intranasal treatment with Neuro-EPO was determined using immunohistochemistry. Mortality of Neuro-EPO-treated gerbils decreased after surgery, and the sensory and motor function was significantly improved. Histopathological mapping showed that Neuro-EPO significantly reduced delayed neuronal death in the brain. Expression of Ngb was upregulated in the cerebral cortex at most time points (expect for 10 min and 48 hr) and in the hippocampus at 10 min and from 48 hr to 5 weeks, whereas EPOR was almost downregulated or unchanged in the brain (expect for 48 hr). The 10 min and 48 hr seemed to be two time points for the brain to switch the expression of both Ngb and EPOR to early and late recovery phase, respectively. In addition, there were two phases, 10 min to 1 hr and 24 hr to 72 hr, respectively, closing to the "golden hour" of about 60 min and the "silver day" of 1 to 3 days, for the brain to recover from stroke onset with intranasal Neuro-EPO treatment. Therefore, the results suggest that the intranasal administration of Neuro-EPO is effective in the treatment of acute brain ischemia. The different expression patterns of Ngb and EPOR is probably due to ischemic tolerance in the cerebral cortex and ischemic sensitivity in the hippocampus. labels: #Globins'
b'Although discovered in 2000, neuroglobin (Ngb) functions are still uncertain. A contribution to the role played by Ngb in neurons could certainly derive from the identification of Ngb endogenous modulators. Here, we evaluate the possibility that Ngb could be regulated by 17\xce\xb2-estradiol (E\xe2\x82\x82) signaling in both SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cell line and mouse hippocampal neurons. 1 nM E\xe2\x82\x82 rapidly induced a 300% increase in Ngb levels in both models. The E\xe2\x82\x82 effect was specific, being not induced by testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. The E\xe2\x82\x82-induced Ngb increase requires estrogen receptor (ER) \xce\xb2, but not ER\xce\xb1, as evaluated by the mimetic effect of ER\xce\xb2-specific agonist DPN and by the blockage of E\xe2\x82\x82 effect in ER\xce\xb2-silenced SK-N-BE cells. Furthermore, both rapid (15 min) ER\xce\xb2-dependent activation of p38/MAPK and transcriptional ER\xce\xb2 activity were required for the estrogenic regulation of Ngb. Finally, E\xe2\x82\x82 exerted a protective effect against H\xe2\x82\x82O\xe2\x82\x82-induced neuroblastoma cell death which was completely prevented in Ngb-silenced cells. Overall, these data suggest that Ngb is part of the E\xe2\x82\x82 signaling mechanism that is activated to exert protective effects against H\xe2\x82\x82O\xe2\x82\x82-induced neurotoxicity. labels: #Globins'
b'AIMS: We investigated the effect of globin digest (GD) on the liver injury and hepatic gene expression profile in galactosamine (GalN)-induced liver injury.MAIN METHODS: The effect of GD on the liver injury was examined by measuring the activities of serum transferases and hepatic antioxidant enzymes, histopathological analysis, gene expression profile, and proteins of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\xce\xb1) and met proto-oncogene (c-Met) in SD rats at 24 h after GalN administration. The effect of GD on the expression of PPAR\xce\xb1 and its target gene in AML-12 mouse hepatocytes was also examined.KEY FINDINGS: GD suppressed the elevated activities of serum transferases in GalN-induced liver injury in SD rats. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substance content in GalN-injured liver was a decreasing tendency by GD. GD suppressed the increased oxidized glutathione content, and increased the decreased protein, reduced glutathione contents, and catalase activity in GalN-injured liver. GD may improve the antioxidant defense system and protein synthesis in GalN-injured liver. GD suppressed the elevated expression of the genes related to the inflammation, and decreased the histopathological grade value of inflammatory cell infiltration in GalN-injured liver. GD increased the expression of PPAR\xce\xb1 protein in GalN-injured liver, and also increased the expression of PPAR\xce\xb1 and its target gene in AML-12 hepatocytes. The total and phosphorylated c-Met proteins in GalN-injured liver were the increasing tendencies by GD.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that GD has the hepatoprotective effect on GalN-induced liver injury in SD rats. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a globular protein that reversibly binds small ligands at the six coordination position of the heme. With respect to other globins similar to myoglobin, Ngb displays some peculiarities as the topological reorganization of the internal cavities coupled to the sliding of the heme, or the binding of the endogenous distal histidine to the heme in the absence of an exogenous ligand. In this Article, by using multiple (independent) molecular dynamics trajectories (about 500 ns in total), the migration pathways of photolized carbon monoxide (CO) within solvated Ngb were analyzed, and a quantitative description of CO migration and corresponding kinetics was obtained. MD results, combined with quantum mechanical calculations on the CO-heme binding-unbinding reaction step in Ngb, allowed construction of a quantitative model representing the relevant steps of CO migration and rebinding. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered vertebrate globin that is expressed in the brain and can reversibly bind oxygen. Mammalian Ngb is involved in neuroprotection during oxidative stress that occurs, for example, during ischemia and reperfusion. Recently, we found that zebrafish, but not human, Ngb can translocate into cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that a chimeric ZHHH Ngb protein, in which the module M1 of human Ngb is replaced by the corresponding region of zebrafish Ngb, can penetrate cell membranes and protect cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggesting that module M1 of zebrafish Ngb is important for protein transduction. Furthermore, we recently showed that Lys7, Lys9, Lys21, and Lys23 in module M1 of zebrafish Ngb are crucial for protein transduction activity. In the present study, we have investigated whether module M1 of zebrafish Ngb can be used as a building block to create novel cell-membrane-penetrating folded proteins. First, we engineered a chimeric myoglobin (Mb), in which module M1 of zebrafish Ngb was fused to the N-terminus of full-length human Mb, and investigated its functional and structural properties. Our results showed that this chimeric Mb protein is stable and forms almost the same heme environment and \xce\xb1-helical structure as human wild-type Mb. In addition, we demonstrated that chimeric Mb has a cell-membrane-penetrating activity similar to zebrafish Ngb. Moreover, we found that glycosaminoglycan is crucial for the cell-membrane-penetrating activity of chimeric Mb as well as that of zebrafish Ngb. These results enable us to conclude that such module substitutions will facilitate the design and production of novel functional proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a highly conserved hemoprotein of uncertain physiological function that evolved from a common ancestor to hemoglobin and myoglobin. It possesses a six-coordinate heme geometry with proximal and distal histidines directly bound to the heme iron, although coordination of the sixth ligand is reversible. We show that deoxygenated human neuroglobin reacts with nitrite to form nitric oxide (NO). This reaction is regulated by redox-sensitive surface thiols, cysteine 55 and 46, which regulate the fraction of the five-coordinated heme, nitrite binding, and NO formation. Replacement of the distal histidine by leucine or glutamine leads to a stable five-coordinated geometry; these neuroglobin mutants reduce nitrite to NO \xe2\x88\xbc2000 times faster than the wild type, whereas mutation of either Cys-55 or Cys-46 to alanine stabilizes the six-coordinate structure and slows the reaction. Using lentivirus expression systems, we show that the nitrite reductase activity of neuroglobin inhibits cellular respiration via NO binding to cytochrome c oxidase and confirm that the six-to-five-coordinate status of neuroglobin regulates intracellular hypoxic NO-signaling pathways. These studies suggest that neuroglobin may function as a physiological oxidative stress sensor and a post-translationally redox-regulated nitrite reductase that generates NO under six-to-five-coordinate heme pocket control. We hypothesize that the six-coordinate heme globin superfamily may subserve a function as primordial hypoxic and redox-regulated NO-signaling proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin and cellular prion protein (PrP(C) ) are expressed in the nervous system and co-localized in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Both proteins do not have an unambiguously assigned function, and it was recently reported that PrP(C) aggregates rapidly in the presence of neuroglobin, whereas it does not aggregate in the presence of myoglobin, another globin with different tissue specificity. Electrostatic complementarity between the unstructured PrP(C) N-terminus and neuroglobin has been proposed to mediate this specific interaction. To verifythis hypothesis experimentally, we have used a combined approach of automated docking and molecular dynamics (MD) studies carried out on short stretches of prion protein (PrP) N-terminus to identify the minimal electrostatically interacting aminoacidic sequences with neuroglobin. Subsequently, we have performed the synthesis of these peptides by solid phase methods, and we tested their interaction with neuroglobin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Preliminary results confirm unequivocally the specific interaction between synthetic PrP peptides and neuroglobin suggesting a crucial role of PrP(C) positively charged regions in thisprotein-protein association. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cgb) is a vertebrate heme-containing globin-protein expressed in a broad range of mammalian tissues. Unlike myoglobin, Cgb displays a hexa-coordinated (bis-hystidyl) heme iron atom, having the heme distal His81(E7) residue as the endogenous sixth ligand. In the present study, we crystallized human Cgb in the presence of a reductant Na\xe2\x82\x82S\xe2\x82\x82O\xe2\x82\x84 under a carbon monoxide (CO) atmosphere, and determined the crystal structure at 2.6 A resolution. The CO ligand occupies the sixth axial position of the heme ferrous iron. Eventually, the imidazole group of His81(E7) is expelled from the sixth position and swings out of the distal heme pocket. The flipping motion of the His81 imidazole group accompanies structural readjustments of some residues (Gln62, Phe63, Gln72, and Ser75) in both the CD-corner and D-helix regions of Cgb. On the other hand, no significant structural changes were observed in other Cgb regions, for example, on the proximal side. These structural alterations that occurred as a result of exogenous ligand (CO) binding are clearly different from those observed in other vertebrate hexa-coordinated globins (mouse neuroglobin, Drosophila melanogaster hemoglobin) and penta-coordinated sperm whale myoglobin. The present study provides the structural basis for further discussion of the unique ligand-binding properties of Cgb. labels: #Globins'
b'A new high oxygen affinity hemoglobin (Hb) variant, Hb Nebraska [\xce\xb286(F2)Ala\xe2\x86\x92Ile, GCC>ATC; HGVS: HBB: c.259G>A;260C>T] is reported. This variant was not identified by routine methods and was only suspected due to erythrocytosis and an abnormal p50 value. The variant was analyzed by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS).

b'We report the first heterozygous case of Hb A(2)-NYU (HBD:c.39T>A) in the Hellenic population. The proband, an adult female from the island of Crete, Greece, was identified during routine family screening. DEAE chromatography of the index case revealed a minor hemoglobin (Hb) fraction preceding the elution of the wild-type Hb A(2). DNA sequencing of the entire HBD gene coding regions indicated that the index case was heterozygous for the rare variant Hb A(2)-NYU. Family studies indicated that this Hb variant was inherited from the mother. This finding underlines the vast genetic heterogeneity of the HBD gene in the Hellenic population. labels: #Globins'
b"AIMS: \xe2\x80\x82 This study immunohistochemically examined the orbitofrontal cortex for three possible candidates in hypoxic/ischemic signaling: the cytokine transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2, the glucose transporter-1 and the neuron-specific oxygen-binding protein neuroglobin.METHODS: \xe2\x80\x82 Post-mortem tissue from 20 depressed and 20 non-depressed individuals was obtained and the expression of the three proteins was analyzed using image analysis software.RESULTS: \xe2\x80\x82 No significant changes were found in transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2 or neuroglobin in the orbitofrontal cortex between depressed and non-depressed individuals. There was, however, a trend towards a reduction in glucose transporter-1 in the depressed group.CONCLUSIONS: \xe2\x80\x82 This study does not clearly support the hypothesis that hypoxic/ischemic processes are behind the pathological deficits in the frontal-subcortical circuitry associated with depression and therefore does not provide evidence to support the 'vascular depression' hypothesis. labels: #Globins"
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is an intracellular, oxygen-binding neuronal protein with protective effects against ischemia and related pathological processes. To identify small molecules capable of inducing Ngb protein expression, which might have therapeutic benefit, we examined Ngb expression by Western blot in cultured HN33 (mouse hippocampal neuron x N18TG2 neuroblastoma) cells. In addition to deferoxamine, which was shown previously to enhance Ngb levels, Ngb expression was increased by the short-chain fatty acids cinnamic acid and valproic acid (\xe2\x89\xa5 100 \xce\xbcmol/l), but not by other short-chain fatty acids, histone deacetylase inhibitors, or anticonvulsants. Drugs that stimulate the expression of neuroprotective proteins like Ngb may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of stroke and other neurological disorders. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a novel member of the vertebrate globin superfamily. Although it is expressed in splanchnic fibroblasts of various organs, details of its function remain unknown. In the present study, kidney ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) increased the number of Cygb-positive cells per area and up-regulated Cygb mRNA and protein expression in kidney cortex tissues. Similarly, hypoxia up-regulated Cygb expression in cultured rat kidney fibroblasts. The biological function of Cygb in vivo was evaluated in Cygb-overexpressing transgenic rats. Renal dysfunction and histologic damage after renal I/R were ameliorated (mean [SE] serum urea nitrogen concentration after I/R injury, 260.6 [44.9]mg/dL in wild-type rats versus 101.0 [36.0] mg/dL in transgenic rats; P<0.05) in association with improvement of oxidative stress. Primary cultured fibroblasts from Cygb transgenic rat kidney were resistant to exogenous oxidant stimuli, and treatment of immortalized kidney fibroblasts with Cygb-small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced cellular oxidant stress and subsequently decreased cell viability (cell count ratio after exposure to hydrogen peroxide, 35.9% [1.6%] in control-siRNA-treated cells versus 25.5% [2.0%]in Cygb-siRNA-treated cells; P<0.05). Further, chemical or mutant disruption of heme in Cygb impaired its antioxidant properties, which suggests that the heme of Cygb per se possesses a radical scavenging function. These findings show for the first time, to our knowledge, that Cygb serves as a defensive mechanism against oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. labels: #Globins'
b'Nitric oxide (NO(\xc2\xb7)) is a toxin, but bacteria have evolved various strategies to detoxify this harmful radical to nitrate, the best known mechanism being the dioxygenase reaction of bacterial flavohaemoglobins. In addition, globins can form oxoferryl (Fe(IV)=O) species through the reaction of the ferric haem with hydrogen peroxide: these species can also detoxify NO(\xc2\xb7) to nitrite and nitrate. During infection, Campylobacter is exposed to both NO(\xc2\xb7) and hydrogen peroxide. A question therefore arises: does Campylobacter jejuni utilize its single domain globin (Cgb) to detoxify NO(\xc2\xb7) via the oxoferryl route, or via the more conventional dioxygenase or denitroxylase routes? The data herein demonstrate that the reaction between Cgb and hydrogen peroxide is much slower than for other globins, and subsequent reaction between the oxoferryl species and NO(\xc2\xb7) is unfavourable. Furthermore, NO(\xc2\xb7) may bind to Cgb in the oxyferrous, ferrous and ferric states. The ample opportunity for NO(\xc2\xb7) to interact with ferrous and ferric Cgb, and the unfavourable reaction of ferric Cgb with hydrogen peroxide, suggests that NO(\xc2\xb7) detoxification in C. jejuni proceeds via a dioxygenase or denitroxylase route requiring the haem iron to exist only in the Fe(II) or Fe(III) redox states. labels: #Globins'
b'Relating structure and spectroscopy is fundamental in characterizing the conformational dynamics and elucidating function at an atomistic level in condensed-phase environments. In particular, the combination of infrared spectroscopy and atomistic simulations has provided fundamental insight into structural assignments of spectroscopic bands. Infrared spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on carbonmonoxy myoglobin (MbCO) were able to partially identify three major CO infrared bands (A0, A1 and A3) which are related to different conformational substates in the active site of the protein. Recently, two similar CO bands were identified from experiments in human carbonmonoxy neuroglobin (NgbCO), named N0 and N3. Time-dependent frequency changes found in the N0 band and a large variation of relaxation times for these bands made the characterization of these substates considerably more difficult compared to MbCO. In this work we discuss the structure-spectroscopy relationship for three different His64 protonation states in human and murine NgbCO using MD simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The present work assigns the N3 band to the His(epsilon)64 tautomer having its side chain in hydrogen bonding contact to CO. Frequencies of the corresponding His64H+ and His(delta)64 tautomers show characteristic contributions to the N0 band. labels: #Globins'
b'Cytoglobin is a recently discovered hexa-co-ordinate haemoglobin that does not appear to function as a classical oxygen-binding protein. Its function is unknown and studies on the effects of changes in its expression have not decisively determined its role within the cell. In the present paper, we report that the protein is transformed from hexa-co-ordinate to penta-co-ordinate on binding a lipid molecule. This transformation occurs with the ferric oxidation state of the protein, but not the ferrous state, indicating that this process only occurs under an oxidative environment and may thus be related to redox-linked cell signalling mechanisms. Oleate binds to the protein in a 1:1 stoichiometry and with high affinity (K(d)=0.7 \xce\xbcM); however, stopped-flow kinetic measurements yield a K(d) value of 110 \xce\xbcM. The discrepancy between these K(d) values may be rationalized by recognizing that cytoglobin is a disulfide-linked dimer and invoking co-operativity in oleate binding. The lipid-induced transformation of cytoglobin from hexa-co-ordinate to penta-co-ordinate does not occur with similar hexa-co-ordinate haemoglobins such as neuroglobin, and therefore appears to be a unique property of cytoglobin among the haemoglobin superfamily. The lipid-derived transformation may explain why cytoglobin has enhanced peroxidatic activity, converting lipids into various oxidized products, a property virtually absent from neuroglobin and much decreased in myoglobin. We propose that the binding of ferric cytoglobin to lipids and their subsequent transformation may be integral to the physiological function of cytoglobin, generating cell signalling lipid molecules under an oxidative environment. labels: #Globins'
b'AIM: To investigate the possible role of rate-limiting enzyme of heme metabolism and globin in the development of the low hemoglobin (Hb), red blood (cell) count (RBC) and hematocrit (Hct) after long-term exercise, and effect of nutrition supplement on sports anemia.METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 10): control (C), exercise (P) and exercise + nutrition (G). Animals in the P and G groups started treadmill running at 30 m/min, 0% grade, 1 min/time. Running time was gradually increased with 2 min/time during initial 5 weeks and final 4 weeks. In addition, running frequency was 2 times/day except initial 2 weeks. At the end of eleventh week, gene expression of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), ferrochelatase, alpha-globin and beta-globin in bone marrow were measured with RT-PCR. Mean-while heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) activity in liver was measured with immunohistochemical method.RESULTS: Eleven weeks of exercise induced a significant increase in HO-1 and a significant increase in gene expression of beta-globin (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). Treatment with anti-sports anemia compound dosage led to no significant differences in rate-limiting enzyme of heme metabolism and globin in the exercised rats. The G group had a significantly higher HO-1 level in liver than the C group (P<0.01). These finds showed that exercise was associated with no significant difference in heme synthetase and alpha-globin gene expression, and significant difference in heme catabolic enzyme and beta-globin gene expression.CONCLUSION: The increase of HO-1 activity in liver might be one of the causes of the lower Hb, RBC and Hct status in exercised rats. labels: #Globins'
b'PURPOSE: In (hemoglobin, Hb) HbE\xce\xb2-thalassemia, HbE (\xce\xb2-26 Glu\xe2\x86\x92Lys) interacts with \xce\xb2-thalassemia to produce clinical manifestation of varying severity. This is the first proteomic effort to study changes in protein levels of erythrocytes isolated from HbE\xce\xb2-thalassemic patients compared to normal.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have used 2-DE and MALDI-MS/MS-based techniques to investigate the differential proteome profiling of membrane and Hb-depleted fraction of cytosolic proteins of erythrocytes isolated from the peripheral blood samples of HbE\xce\xb2-thalassemia patients and normal volunteers.RESULTS: Our study showed that redox regulators such as peroxiredoxin 2, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin and chaperones such as \xce\xb1-hemoglobin stabilizing protein and HSP-70 were upregulated in HbE\xce\xb2-thalassemia. We have also observed larger amounts of membrane associated globin chains and indications of disruption of spectrin-based junctional complex in the membrane skeleton of HbE\xce\xb2-thalassemic erythrocytes upon detection of low molecular weight fragments of \xce\xb2-spectrin and decrease in \xce\xb2-actin and dematin content.CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We have observed interesting changes in the proteomic levels of redox regulators and chaperons in the thalassemic hemolysates and have observed strong correlation or association of the extent of such proteomic changes with HbE levels. This could be important in understanding the role of HbE in disease progression and pathophysiology. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: The lancelet amphioxus (Cephalochordata) is a close relative of vertebrates and thus may enhance our understanding of vertebrate gene and genome evolution. In this context, the globins are one of the best studied models for gene family evolution. Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of an intracellular globin in notochord tissue and myotome of amphioxus, but the corresponding gene has not yet been identified. Genomic resources of Branchiostoma floridae now facilitate the identification, experimental confirmation and molecular evolutionary analysis of its globin gene repertoire.RESULTS: We show that B. floridae harbors at least fifteen paralogous globin genes, all of which reveal evidence of gene expression. The protein sequences of twelve globins display the conserved characteristics of a functional globin fold. In phylogenetic analyses, the amphioxus globin BflGb4 forms a common clade with vertebrate neuroglobins, indicating the presence of this nerve globin in cephalochordates. Orthology is corroborated by conserved syntenic linkage of BflGb4 and flanking genes. The kinetics of ligand binding of recombinantly expressed BflGb4 reveals that this globin is hexacoordinated with a high oxygen association rate, thus strongly resembling vertebrate neuroglobin. In addition, possible amphioxus orthologs of the vertebrate globin X lineage and of the myoglobin/cytoglobin/hemoglobin lineage can be identified, including one gene as a candidate for being expressed in notochord tissue. Genomic analyses identify conserved synteny between amphioxus globin-containing regions and the vertebrate \xce\xb2-globin locus, possibly arguing against a late transpositional origin of the \xce\xb2-globin cluster in vertebrates. Some amphioxus globin gene structures exhibit minisatellite-like tandem duplications of intron-exon boundaries ("mirages"), which may serve to explain the creation of novel intron positions within the globin genes.CONCLUSIONS: The identification of putative orthologs of vertebrate globin variants in the B. floridae genome underlines the importance of cephalochordates for elucidating vertebrate genome evolution. The present study facilitates detailed functional studies of the amphioxus globins in order to trace conserved properties and specific adaptations of respiratory proteins at the base of chordate evolution. labels: #Globins'
b"The haemoglobin protein, required for oxygen transportation in the body, is encoded by \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes that are arranged in clusters. The transpositional model for the evolution of distinct \xce\xb1-globin and \xce\xb2-globin clusters in amniotes is much simpler than the previously proposed whole genome duplication model. According to this model, all jawed vertebrates share one ancient region containing \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-globin genes and several flanking genes in the order MPG-C16orf35-(\xce\xb1-\xce\xb2)-GBY-LUC7L that has been conserved for more than 410 million years, whereas amniotes evolved a distinct \xce\xb2-globin cluster by insertion of a transposed \xce\xb2-globin gene from this ancient region into a cluster of olfactory receptors flanked by CCKBR and RRM1. It could not be determined whether this organisation is conserved in all amniotes because of the paucity of information from non-avian reptiles. To fill in this gap, we examined globin gene organisation in a squamate reptile, the Australian bearded dragon lizard, Pogona vitticeps (Agamidae). We report here that the \xce\xb1-globin cluster (HBK, HBA) is flanked by C16orf35 and GBY and is located on a pair of microchromosomes, whereas the \xce\xb2-globin cluster is flanked by RRM1 on the 3' end and is located on the long arm of chromosome 3. However, the CCKBR gene that flanks the \xce\xb2-globin cluster on the 5' end in other amniotes is located on the short arm of chromosome 5 in P. vitticeps, indicating that a chromosomal break between the \xce\xb2-globin cluster and CCKBR occurred at least in the agamid lineage. Our data from a reptile species provide further evidence to support the transpositional model for the evolution of \xce\xb2-globin gene cluster in amniotes. labels: #Globins"
b'The subterranean mole rat Spalax is an excellent model for studying adaptation of a mammal toward chronic environmental hypoxia. Neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb) are O(2)-binding respiratory proteins and thus candidates for being involved in molecular hypoxia adaptations of Spalax. Ngb is expressed primarily in vertebrate nerves, whereas Cygb is found in extracellular matrix-producing cells and in some neurons. The physiological functions of both proteins are not fully understood but discussed with regard to O(2) supply, the detoxification of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, and apoptosis protection. Spalax Ngb and Cygb coding sequences are strongly conserved. However, mRNA and protein levels of Ngb in Spalax brain are 3-fold higher than in Rattus norvegicus under normoxia. Importantly, Spalax expresses Ngb in neurons and additionally in glia, whereas in hypoxia-sensitive rodents Ngb expression is limited to neurons. Hypoxia causes an approximately 2-fold down-regulation of Ngb mRNA in brain of rat and mole rat. A parallel regulatory response was found for myoglobin (Mb) in Spalax and rat muscle, suggesting similar functions of Mb and Ngb. Cygb also revealed an augmented normoxic expression in Spalax vs. rat brain, but not in heart or liver, indicating distinct tissue-specific functions. Hypoxia induced Cygb transcription in heart and liver of both mammals, with the most prominent mRNA up-regulation (12-fold) in Spalax heart. Our data suggest that tissue globins contribute to the remarkable tolerance of Spalax toward environmental hypoxia. This is consistent with the proposed cytoprotective effect of Ngb and Cygb under pathological hypoxic/ischemic conditions in mammals. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: The induction of fetal hemoglobin during definitive erythropoiesis is a major therapeutic goal in \xce\xb2-globin gene disorders. Butyrate induces fetal hemoglobin, and p38 phosphorylation has been implicated in this process. We studied p38 and the effect of its inhibitors in a physiologic primary cell model of fetal/embryonic globin gene induction during definitive erythropoiesis.METHODS: p38 phosphorylation was evaluated in a short-term culture of definitive erythroid precursor (EryD) cells following butyrate induction, absent prolonged exposure to cytokines. The impact of p38 inhibitors on embryonic/fetal globin gene induction by butyrate and on normal erythroid processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle occupancy, and RNA transcription, was also examined.RESULTS: p38 phosphorylation, maximal at harvest of murine fetal liver-derived EryD (FL EryD), when minimal embryonic/fetal globin gene expression is seen, is suppressed by EPO (as reported by others). Butyrate initially delays EPO-mediated suppression of p38 phosphorylation, but p38 phosphorylation thereafter, at 30 minutes to 48 hours, is equivalent and at low levels in EPO-treated FL EryD, with or without butyrate. Inhibitors of p38, at 10-50 \xce\xbcM, prevent butyrate-mediated induction of embryonic/fetal globin gene expression. We found that p38 inhibitors, which also disrupt non-p38 signaling pathways, perturb cell division, erythroid differentiation, transit through the cell cycle, and RNA transcription in primary EryD.CONCLUSION: p38 inhibitors interrupt normal erythropoiesis and the capacity for embryonic/fetal globin gene induction. However, p38 signaling is maximal in primary EryD at harvest, when embryonic globin genes are minimally expressed, and diminishes thereafter. We conclude that p38 inhibitors disrupt cellular pathways that are essential to butyrate-induced embryonic/fetal globin gene expression. However, levels of p38 phosphorylation are not coordinate with embryonic/fetal globin gene expression in EryD, and increased signaling through p38 may not be the sine qua non for embryonic/fetal globin gene induction. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), a newly identified globin in vertebrate brain, has been suggested to be able to protect against brain hypoxic-ischemic injury. However, owing to its large size, the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to Ngb limits its application in brain injury. Recently, the 11-amino-acid human immunodeficiency virus trans-activator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain was shown to successfully deliver macromolecules into the brain. This study explored whether the TAT-Ngb fusion protein can cross the BBB and protect the brain from cerebral ischemia. The TAT-Ngb fusion protein generated from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was efficiently delivered into mice brain tissues by intravenous injection as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Two groups of mice were treated with filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 30min or 2h followed by reperfusion. Each group was then divided into sub-groups and was injected intravenously with TAT-Ngb, Ngb, or saline respectively before MCAO or immediately after reperfusion. Compared with the Ngb- and saline-treated group, the group with TAT-Ngb treated 2h before MCAO showed significantly less brain infarct volume and had better neurologic outcomes (p<0.05). Furthermore, a TAT-Ngb injection following a 30-min MCAO treatment significantly increased neuronal survival in the striatum (p<0.05). Our results demonstrated that the exogenous Ngb fusion protein containing the TAT protein transduction domain could be efficiently transduced into neurons in the mouse and protect the brain from mild or moderate ischemic injury. labels: #Globins'
b'Despite the source or mechanism of origin of islets of Langerhans or islet \xce\xb2-cells, all suffer significant cell loss from ischemia after isolation, thereby reducing the surviving islet mass available for study or transplantation. Methods to reduce beta cell death after islet isolation and transplantation must be developed if islet transplantation is to become an accepted treatment for diabetes. In order to enhance intracellular oxygen delivery and utilization, islets were transfected with a plasmid encoding cytoglobin, an intracellular oxygen binding protein. Oxygen consumption, insulin secretion, and the degree of central islet necrosis were measured in untreated and transfected islets to test the effects of cytoglobin on islet survival and function in vitro. The presence of cytoglobin reduced islet cell loss by reducing hypoxia related central islet necrosis and increased insulin secretion as compared with untreated islets. Cytoglobin treated islets maintained a normal rate of oxygen consumption, while untreated islets increased the rate of oxygen consumption caused by a shift to anaerobic metabolism and increased reactive oxygen specie synthesis. The induction of cytoglobin in islets may reduce cell loss from chronic hypoxia and may be a useful adjunct to islet transplantation. labels: #Globins'
b'YddV from Escherichia coli (Ec) is a novel globin-coupled heme-based oxygen sensor protein displaying diguanylate cyclase activity in response to oxygen availability. In this study, we quantified the turnover numbers of the active [Fe(III), 0.066 min(-1); Fe(II)-O(2) and Fe(II)-CO, 0.022 min(-1)] [Fe(III), Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX complex; Fe(II), Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX complex]and inactive forms [Fe(II) and Fe(II)-NO,<0.01 min(-1)] of YddV for the first time. Our data indicate that the YddV reaction is the rate-determining step for two consecutive reactions coupled with phosphodiesterase Ec DOS activity on cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) [turnover number of Ec DOS-Fe(II)-O(2), 61 min(-1)]. Thus, O(2) binding and the heme redox switch of YddV appear to be critical factors in the regulation of c-di-GMP homeostasis. The redox potential and autoxidation rate of heme of the isolated heme domain of YddV (YddV-heme) were determined to be -17 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode and 0.0076 min(-1), respectively. The Fe(II) complexes of Y43A and Y43L mutant proteins (residues at the heme distal side of the isolated heme-bound globin domain of YddV) exhibited very low O(2) affinities, and thus, their Fe(II)-O(2) complexes were not detected on the spectra. The O(2) dissociation rate constant of the Y43W protein was>150 s(-1), which is significantly larger than that of the wild-type protein (22 s(-1)). The autoxidation rate constants of the Y43F and Y43W mutant proteins were 0.069 and 0.12 min(-1), respectively, which are also markedly higher than that of the wild-type protein. The resonance Raman frequencies representing \xce\xbd(Fe-O(2)) (559 cm(-1)) of the Fe(II)-O(2) complex and \xce\xbd(Fe-CO) (505 cm(-1)) of the Fe(II)-CO complex of Y43F differed from those (\xce\xbd(Fe-O(2)), 565 cm(-1); \xce\xbd(Fe-CO), 495 cm(-1)) of the wild-type protein, suggesting that Tyr43 forms hydrogen bonds with both O(2) and CO molecules. On the basis of the results, we suggest that Tyr43 located at the heme distal side is important for the O(2) recognition and stability of the Fe(II)-O(2) complex, because the hydroxyl group of the residue appears to interact electrostatically with the O(2) molecule bound to the Fe(II) complex in YddV. Our findings clearly support a role of Tyr in oxygen sensing, and thus modulation of overall conversion from GTP to pGpG via c-di-GMP catalyzed by YddV and Ec DOS, which may be applicable to other globin-coupled oxygen sensor enzymes. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), a hexa-coordinated hemoprotein primarily expressed in the brain and retina, is thought to be involved in neuroprotection and signal transduction. Ngb can reversibly bind small ligands such as O\xe2\x82\x82 and CO to the heme iron by replacing the distal histidine which is bound to the iron as the endogenous ligand. In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the functionally related structural properties and dynamical characteristics in carboxy mouse neuroglobin and three distal mutants including single mutants H64V, K67T and double mutant H64V/K67T. MD simulations suggest that the heme sliding motion induced by the binding of exogenous ligand is affected by the distal mutation obviously. Accompanying changes in loop flexibility and internal cavities imply the structural rearrangement of Ngb. Moreover, the solvent accessibility of heme and some crucial residues are influenced revealing an interactive network on the distal side. The work elucidates that the key residues K67 at E10 and H64 at E7 are significant in modulating the heme sliding and hence the structural and physiological function of Ngb. labels: #Globins'
b"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intra-retinal expression of neuroglobin (Ngb) and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in acute retina ischemia rats.METHODS: It was an experimental study. The acute retina ischemia model was established by specific hypothesised left retina artery of Sprague-Dawley rats. Forty rats were divided into four groups (0, 15, 30, 60 min) by the time of retina ischemia. Every group has 10 rats, in one group random 3 rats were detected by Western blotting; 4 rats were detected by ganglion cell counted by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry fluorescence intensity analysis. The rest 3 rats were detected by Western blotting. The difference among different data were analyzed statistically by One-factor analysis of variance and LSD-t analysis.RESULTS: The intra-retinal expression of Ngb reached maximum after acute ischemia 15 minute (P = 0.000). then the expression began decreasing. After 30 minute acute ischemia, the expression of Ngb had approached normal (P = 0.728), while, the cell number of RGCs began lower than 0 min group (P = 0.011); after 60 minute acute ischemia, the expression of Ngb had been obviously lower than 0 min group (P = 0.001), the cell number of RGCs had been further lower than 0 min group (P = 0.000). The expression of Ngb in RGCs layer was highest in rat retina. The expression in inner plexiform layer and external plexiform layer were lower than the former. The expression of Ngb RGCs was mostly intracytoplasm. After 30 minute acute ischemia, the expression of Ngb were detected in mitochondrial outer compartment and mitochondrial cristae, but in cytoplasm of inner nuclear layer and outer nuclear layer the Ngb was not found.CONCLUSION: Ngb quickly steps-up when RGCs die in acute retina ischemia, and mainly expresses intracytoplasm of RGCs. It has tense relationships with nerve cells' survival in hypoxia. labels: #Globins"
b'Fishes live in an aquatic environment with low or temporally changing O(2) availability. Variations in O(2) levels require many anatomical, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical adaptations that ensure the uptake of an adequate amount of O(2). Some fish species are comparatively well adapted to tolerate low O(2) partial pressure (hypoxia). The Japanese ricefish medaka (Oryzias latipes) is an important model organism for biomedical research that shows remarkable tolerance towards hypoxia. We have investigated the regulation and role of globins under hypoxia. We applied four different regimes of chronic hypoxia (24 and 48\xc2\xa0h at PO(2)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02 or 4\xc2\xa0kPa) as well as acute hypoxia (2\xc2\xa0h at PO(2)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.5\xc2\xa0kPa) to adult male medaka. Changes of mRNA levels of seven globin genes (adult hemoglobin \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2, myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin 1 and 2, globin X), three hypoxia-response genes (lactate dehydrogenase b, phosphoglycerate kinase, adrenomedullin 1) and two putative reference genes (cyclophilin, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) were monitored by means of quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. We observed strong upregulation of myoglobin, which is also expressed in the medaka brain, as previously demonstrated for carp, goldfish and zebrafish. The hemoglobin chains were found upregulated, whereas earlier studies found down-regulation of hemoglobin in hypoxic zebrafish. By contrast, neuroglobin mRNA was not affected by hypoxia in medaka, but had been found upregulated in zebrafish. Globin X is induced in medaka brain, but down-regulated in zebrafish. Thus, the patterns of hypoxia response of globins are strikingly different in various fish species, which can be interpreted as indication for different roles of the various globins in hypoxia response and for alternative metabolic strategies of fish species in coping with O(2) deprivation. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: The vertebrate globin genes encoding the \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-subunits of the tetrameric hemoglobins are clustered at two unlinked loci. The highly conserved linear order of the genes flanking the hemoglobins provides a strong anchor for inferring common ancestry of the globin clusters. In fish, the number of \xce\xb1-\xce\xb2-linked globin genes varies considerably between different sublineages and seems to be related to prevailing physico-chemical conditions. Draft sequences of the Atlantic cod genome enabled us to determine the genomic organization of the globin repertoire in this marine species that copes with fluctuating environments of the temperate and Arctic regions.RESULTS: The Atlantic cod genome was shown to contain 14 globin genes, including nine hemoglobin genes organized in two unlinked clusters designated \xce\xb25-\xce\xb11-\xce\xb21-\xce\xb14 and \xce\xb23-\xce\xb24-\xce\xb12-\xce\xb13-\xce\xb22. The diverged cod hemoglobin genes displayed different expression levels in adult fish, and tetrameric hemoglobins with or without a Root effect were predicted. The novel finding of maternally inherited hemoglobin mRNAs is consistent with a potential role played by fish hemoglobins in the non-specific immune response. In silico analysis of the six teleost genomes available showed that the two \xce\xb1-\xce\xb2 globin clusters are flanked by paralogs of five duplicated genes, in agreement with the proposed teleost-specific duplication of the ancestral vertebrate globin cluster. Screening the genome of extant urochordate and cephalochordate species for conserved globin-flanking genes revealed linkage of RHBDF1, MPG and ARHGAP17 to globin genes in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, while these genes together with LCMT are closely positioned in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), but seem to be unlinked to the multiple globin genes identified in this species.CONCLUSION: The plasticity of Atlantic cod to variable environmental conditions probably involves the expression of multiple globins with potentially different properties. The interspecific difference in number of fish hemoglobin genes contrasts with the highly conserved synteny of the flanking genes. The proximity of globin-flanking genes in the tunicate and amphioxus genomes resembles the RHBDF1-MPG-\xce\xb1-globin-ARHGAP17-LCMT linked genes in man and chicken. We hypothesize that the fusion of the three chordate linkage groups 3, 15 and 17 more than 800 MYA led to the ancestral vertebrate globin cluster during a geological period of increased atmospheric oxygen content. labels: #Globins'
b'AIM: The unexpected identification of myoglobin (MB) in breast cancer prompted us to evaluate the clinico-pathological value of MB, haemoglobin (HB) and cytoglobin (CYGB) in human breast carcinoma cases. We further screened for the presence of neuroglobin (NGB) and CYGB in tumours of diverse origin, and assessed the O(2) -response of HB, MB and CYGB mRNAs in cancer cell lines, to better elicit the links between this ectopic globin expression and tumour hypoxia.METHODS: Breast tumours were analysed by immunohistochemistry for HB, MB and CYGB and correlated with clinico-pathological parameters. Screening for CYGB and NGB mRNA expression in tumour entities was performed by hybridization, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and bioinformatics. Hypoxic or anoxic responses of HB, MB and CYGB mRNAs was analysed by qPCR in human Hep3B, MCF7, HeLa and RCC4 cancer cell lines.RESULTS: 78.8% of breast cancer cases were positive for MB, 77.9% were positive for HB and 55.4% expressed CYGB. The closest correlation with markers of hypoxia was observed for CYGB. Compared to the weakly positive status of MB in healthy breast tissues, invasive tumours either lost or up-regulated MB. Breast carcinomas showed the tendency to silence CYGB. HB was not seen in normal tissues and up-regulated in tumours. Beyond breast malignancies, expression levels of NGB and CYGB mRNAs were extremely low in brain tumours (glioblastoma, astrocytoma). NGB was not observed in non-brain tumours. CYGB mRNA, readily detectable in breast cancer and other tumours, is down-regulated in lung adenocarcinomas. Alpha1 globin (\xce\xb11 globin) and Mb were co-expressed in MCF7 and HeLa cells; CYGB transcription was anoxia-inducible in Hep3B and RCC4 cells.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time that HB and CYGB are reported in breast cancer. Neither NGB nor CYGB are systematically up-regulated in tumours. The down-regulated CYGB expression in breast and lung tumours is in line with a tumour-suppressor role. Each of the screened cancer cells expresses at least one globin (i.e. main globin species: CYGB in Hep3B; \xce\xb11 globin + MB in MCF7 and HeLa). Thus, globins exist in a wide variety of solid tumours. However, the generally weak expression of the endogenous proteins in the cancer argues against a significant contribution to tumour oxygenation. Future studies should consider that cancer-expressed globins might function in ways not directly linked to the binding and transport of oxygen. labels: #Globins'
b"Free radicals are by-products of metabolism and exist in a homeostasis between generation and scavenging in vivo. Excessive free radicals cause various diseases, including nervous system diseases. Neuroglobin (Ngb), a nervous system-specific oxygen-binding protein, has been suggested to be a potential free radical scavenger in the nervous system in vivo; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant potential and free radical scavenging properties of recombinant human Ngb (rhNgb) in vitro. Interestingly, we found that the rhNgb protein itself has a direct and distinct antioxidant capacity and can efficiently scavenge a variety of free radicals, including the [2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] (ABTS) cation, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical. The capacity of rhNgb to scavenge the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide was even comparable to that of vitamin C. In addition, rhNgb had Fe(2+) chelating activity but hemoglobin did not. In conclusion, our results indicated that the rhNgb protein itself has antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, providing fundamental evidence for the neuroprotective function of Ngb. These data provide key information for the origin of the neuroprotective and physiological role of Ngb and will promote the treatment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related diseases using this novel oxygen-binding globin. labels: #Globins"
b'Polarized Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of murine carbonmonoxy-neuroglobin (NgbCO) single crystals have been collected and compared with a number of derivatives of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb), that is, the nitrosyl (MbNO) and deoxy (Mb) derivatives, the previously reported cyanomet (MbCN) and carbonmonoxy (MbCO) derivatives, and the cryogenic photoproduct of MbCO (Mb\xc2\xb7CO). The single crystals under study exhibit a strong XANES angular dichroism which allows the heme geometry of each sample to be analyzed with extremely high accuracy via the full multiple scattering (MS) approach. The results of two alternative methods to undergo the MS analysis have been compared with high resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) data and with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data in solution. As a result of the present analysis, the Fe-heme structure in solution and in the cryo-trapped NgbCO single crystal (which cracks at room temperature) are the same. Accordingly, the residual energy involved in the protein relaxation responsible of crystal cracking at room temperature after CO binding does not reside in the heme pocket. A combined approach (polarized XANES and XRD) is suggested to be applied on the same single crystals of metalloproteins at opportunely equipped synchrotron beamlines. labels: #Globins'
b'High-altitude hypoxia (reduced inspired oxygen tension due to decreased barometric pressure) exerts severe physiological stress on the human body. Two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living in these regions exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Although these responses have been well characterized physiologically, their underlying genetic basis remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaption and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude. labels: #Globins'
b'This work explores the effect of long-range tertiary contacts on the distribution of residual secondary structure in the unfolded state of an alpha-helical protein. N-terminal fragments of increasing length, in conjunction with multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, were employed. A protein representative of the ubiquitous globin fold was chosen as the model system. We found that, while most of the detectable alpha-helical population in the unfolded ensemble does not depend on the presence of the C-terminal region (corresponding to the native G and H helices), specific N-to-C long-range contacts between the H and A-B-C regions enhance the helical secondary structure content of the N terminus (A-B-C regions). The simple approach introduced here, based on the evaluation of N-terminal polypeptide fragments of increasing length, is of general applicability to identify the influence of long-range interactions in unfolded proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'Late-stage erythroid cells synthesize large quantities of haemoglobin, a process requiring the co-ordinated regulation of globin and haem synthesis as well as iron uptake. In the present study, we investigated the role of the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling pathways in MEL (mouse erythroleukaemia) cell differentiation. We found that treatment of HMBA (hexamethylene bisacetamide)-induced MEL cells with the ERK pathway inhibitor UO126 results in an increase in intracellular haem and haemoglobin levels. The transcript levels of the genes coding for \xce\xb2(major)-globin, the haem biosynthesis enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2 and the mitochondrial iron transporter mitoferrin 1 are up-regulated. We also showed enhanced expression of globin and transferrin receptor 1 proteins upon UO126 treatment. With respect to iron uptake, we found that ERK inhibitor treatment led to an increase in both haem-bound and total iron. In contrast, treatment of MEL cells with the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor SB202190 had the opposite effect, resulting in decreased globin expression, haem synthesis and iron uptake. Reporter assays showed that globin promoter and HS2 enhancer-mediated transcription was under the control of MAPKs, as inhibition of the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways led to increased and decreased gene activity respectively. Our present results suggest that the ERK1/2 and p38\xce\xb1/\xce\xb2 MAPKs play antagonistic roles in HMBA-induced globin gene expression and erythroid differentiation. These results provide a novel link between MAPK signalling and the regulation of haem biosynthesis and iron uptake in erythroid cells. labels: #Globins'
b"Cytoglobin (Cygb), a novel member of the globin superfamily, is expressed by fibroblasts in various organs. However, its function remains unknown. Because of its localization, we speculated that a biological role of Cygb may be related to fibrogenesis. To clarify the role of Cygb in kidney fibrosis, we employed the remnant kidney model in rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase in Cygb expression in parallel with disease progression. To investigate the functional consequence of Cygb upregulation, we established transgenic rats overexpressing rat Cygb. Overexpression of Cygb improved histological injury, preserved renal function, and ameliorated fibrosis, as estimated by the accumulation of collagen I and IV as well as Masson trichrome staining. These protective effects of Cygb were associated with a decrease in nitrotyrosine deposition in the kidney and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion as a marker of oxidative stress. We also performed in vitro studies utilizing a rat kidney fibroblast cell line transiently overexpressing Cygb, an inducible kidney cell transfected with Cygb, and primary cultured fibroblasts isolated from the kidneys of the transgenic rats. These different experimental systems consistently showed that Cygb inhibited collagen synthesis. Furthermore, mutant disruption of heme in Cygb that impaired its antioxidant properties led to the loss of antifibrotic effects, suggesting that Cygb reduces fibrosis via a radical scavenging function. In conclusion, we showed that Cygb plays an important role in protection of the kidney against fibrosis via the amelioration of oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Cygb might represent a good therapeutic target in chronic kidney disease. labels: #Globins"
b'Hematopoiesis during mammalian embryonic development has been perceived as a migratory phenomenon, from the yolk sac blood island to the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, fetal liver (FL), and subsequently, the fetal bone marrow. In this study, we investigated the effects of primary stromal cells from fetal hematopoietic niches and their conditioned media (CM), applied singly or in sequential orders, on induction of human embryonic stem cells, H1, H9, and H14 lines, to hematopoietic cells. Our results demonstrated that stromal support of FL, AGM\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89FL, and AGM\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89FL\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89fetal bone marrow significantly increased the proliferation of embryoid bodies (EB) at day 18 of hematopoietic induction in the presence of thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, and Flt-3 ligand. AGM\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89FL also increased hematopoietic colony-forming unit (CFU) formation. CM did not enhance EB proliferation but CM of FL and AGM\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89FL significantly increased the density of total CFU and early erythroid (burst-forming unit) progenitors. Increased commitment to the hematopoietic lineage was demonstrated by enhanced expressions of CD45, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globins in CFU at day 32, compared with EB at day 18. CM of FL significantly increased these globin expressions, indicating enhanced switches from embryonic to fetal and adult erythropoiesis. Over 50% and 10% of cells derived from CFU expressed CD45 and beta-globin proteins, respectively. Expressions of hematopoietic regulatory genes (Bmi-1, \xce\xb2-Catenin, Hox B4, GATA-1) were increased in EB or CFU cultures supported by FL or sequential CM. Our study has provided a strategy for derivation of hematopoietic cells from embryonic stem cells under the influence of primary hematopoietic niches and CM, particularly the FL. labels: #Globins'
b"We have developed an experimental procedure to analyze the spatial proximity of nuclear matrix-bound DNA fragments. This protocol, referred to as Matrix 3C (M3C), includes a high salt extraction of nuclei, the removal of distal parts of unfolded DNA loops using restriction enzyme treatment, ligation of the nuclear matrix-bound DNA fragments and a subsequent analysis of ligation frequencies. Using the M3C procedure, we have demonstrated that CpG islands of at least three housekeeping genes that surround the chicken \xce\xb1-globin gene domain are assembled into a complex (presumably, a transcription factory) that is stabilized by the nuclear matrix in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. In erythroid cells, the regulatory elements of the \xce\xb1-globin genes are attracted to this complex to form a new assembly: an active chromatin hub that is linked to the pre-existing transcription factory. The erythroid-specific part of the assembly is removed by high salt extraction. Based on these observations, we propose that mixed transcription factories that mediate the transcription of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes are composed of a permanent compartment containing integrated into the nuclear matrix promoters of housekeeping genes and a 'guest' compartment where promoters and regulatory elements of tissue-specific genes can be temporarily recruited. labels: #Globins"
b'INTRODUCTION: Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) is used in corrective cardiac surgery for complex congenital heart disease. Endogenous protective mechanisms may be responsible for the prevention of brain damage after hypothermic ischemia. Neuroglobin and cytoglobin are expressed in brain cells and appear to modulate hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, their neuroprotective potency is still not understood. Thus the aim of this study was to detect the influence exerted by DHCA on their expression.METHODS: The effects of DHCA were analyzed in a neonatal piglet model with cardiopulmonary bypass, DHCA of 60 and 120 min and subsequent reperfusion of 6h. Complete histological analysis and changes in the mRNA expression of neuroglobin and cytoglobin were measured in the brain.RESULTS: In comparison to animals without DHCA, neuroglobin expression was stable after 60 min DHCA and neuronal cell necrosis in the cortex was mild (<10 %). Neuroglobin expression was significantly reduced after 120 min DHCA, which was accompanied by substantial neuronal cell necrosis (>50 %). Cytoglobin expression did not differ significantly between animals with neuronal necrosis vs. sham.CONCLUSION: Constitutive expression levels of neuroglobin may explain the mild neuronal injury after 60 min DHCA. Significant neuronal cell death correlates with reduced neuroglobin expression and might reflect a limited capacity to compensate for ischemic injury. Both respiratory cell proteins may constitute attractive targets for therapeutic modulation of gene regulation, but further studies are necessary. labels: #Globins'
b'Natural selection often promotes evolutionary innovation by coopting preexisting genes for new functions, and this process may be greatly facilitated by gene duplication. Here we report an example of cooptive convergence where paralogous members of the globin gene superfamily independently evolved a specialized O(2) transport function in the two deepest branches of the vertebrate family tree. Specifically, phylogenetic evidence demonstrates that erythroid-specific O(2) transport hemoglobins evolved independently from different ancestral precursor proteins in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and jawless fish (cyclostomes, represented by lamprey and hagfish). A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate globin gene superfamily revealed that the erythroid hemoglobins of cyclostomes are orthologous to the cytoglobin protein of gnathostome vertebrates, a hexacoordinate globin that has no O(2) transport function and that is predominantly expressed in fibroblasts and related cell types. The phylogeny reconstruction also revealed that vertebrate-specific globins are grouped into four main clades: (i) cyclostome hemoglobin + cytoglobin, (ii) myoglobin + globin E, (iii) globin Y, and (iv) the alpha- and beta-chain hemoglobins of gnathostomes. In the hemoglobins of gnathostomes and cyclostomes, multisubunit quaternary structures provide the basis for cooperative O(2) binding and allosteric regulation by coupling the effects of ligand binding at individual subunits with interactions between subunits. However, differences in numerous structural details belie their independent origins. This example of convergent evolution of protein function provides an impressive demonstration of the ability of natural selection to cobble together complex design solutions by tinkering with different variations of the same basic protein scaffold. labels: #Globins'
b'A 40-year-old Greek male was admitted to the hospital because of acute respiratory infection. The patient has been undergoing regular venesection for erythrocytosis for 20 years; he has also been taking oral anticoagulants for thrombosis for 15 years. The molecular defect for erythrocytosis was detected together with the rare Hb Olympia (HBB:c.61G>A) variant. This hemoglobin (Hb) variant was found in combination with two thalassemia-type globin gene defects, namely beta(0)-thalassemia (beta(0)-thal), HBB:c.118C>T and alpha(0)-thal (- -(MED)). This combination of three molecular defects is the first such case reported in the literature. labels: #Globins'
b'Retrotransposons including endogenous retroviruses and their solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) compose>40% of the human genome. Many of them are located in intergenic regions far from genes. Whether these intergenic retrotransposons serve beneficial host functions is not known. Here we show that an LTR retrotransposon of ERV-9 human endogenous retrovirus located 40-70 kb upstream of the human fetal gamma- and adult beta-globin genes serves a long-range, host function. The ERV-9 LTR contains multiple CCAAT and GATA motifs and competitively recruits a high concentration of NF-Y and GATA-2 present in low abundance in adult erythroid cells to assemble an LTR/RNA polymerase II complex. The LTR complex transcribes intergenic RNAs unidirectionally through the intervening DNA to loop with and modulate transcription factor occupancies at the far downstream globin promoters, thereby modulating globin gene switching by a competitive mechanism. labels: #Globins'
b'The globin-coupled sensor (GCS) of Geobacter sulfurreducens is unique amongst GCSs in that its signalling domain is a transmembrane domain with yet unknown function. In the present work we use X-band continuous-wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to investigate the ferric form of the globin domain of the G. sulfurreducens GCS (GsGCS(162)) at pH 8.5. This form shows a unique bis-histidine coordination of the heme with the F8His and E11His. In contrast with previous crystal structure data, where three conformers of the heme structure were identified, ferric GsGCS(162) assumes only one conformation in frozen solution. The EPR data of ferric GsGCS162 are compared in detail with those of other bis-histidine coordinated globins, including other GCS systems. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered globin that affords protection against hypoxic/ischemic-induced cell injury in brain. Hypoxic/ischemic injury is associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In previous studies, we found that Ngb has antioxidative properties, and protects PC-12 cells against hypoxia- and \xce\xb2-amyloid-induced cell death. To further delineate the potential role of Ngb in protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses Ngb. Hippocampal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by a 10-minute bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries, and the animal brains were assessed 3 days later. CA1 neural injury was determined by cresyl violet staining. Lipid peroxidation was assessed using a malonyldialdehyde assay kit, whereas ROS/RNS accumulation was determined by Het staining in the CA1 hippocampal region. Hippocampal Ngb mRNA and protein expressions were assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Neuroglobin was successfully overexpressed in the hippocampus of Ngb transgenic mice. After ischemia-reperfusion, CA1 ROS/RNS production and lipid peroxidation were markedly decreased in Ngb transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, CA1 neuronal injury was also markedly reduced. Thus, Ngb may confer protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain through its intrinsic antioxidant properties. labels: #Globins'
b'Amphitrite ornata dehaloperoxidase (DHP) is the first heme-containing globin possessing a native peroxidase enzymatic activity. DHP catalyzes the H(2)O(2)-dependent dehalogenation of halophenols. By possessing this detoxifying enzymatic activity, these organisms are able to thrive in an environment contaminated with toxic haloaromatics. It has been proposed that DHP evolved from a dioxygen carrier globin protein and therefore possesses dual physiological roles of O(2) carrier and dehaloperoxidase. Although DHP is isolated in the catalytically inactive oxyferrous state (oxy-DHP), we find that the combination of H(2)O(2) and the substrate 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) brings about facile switching of oxy-DHP to the enzymatically active ferric state via a process likely involving substrate radicals (TCP*). In contrast, in the absence of TCP, H(2)O(2) alone converts oxy-DHP to an inactive state (compound RH) instead of oxidizing the enzyme to the ferric state. Further, although the rate of autoxidation of oxy-DHP is somewhat enhanced by the presence of TCP, the effect is too small to be the functional switch. Instead, both substrate and H(2)O(2) are needed to convert oxy-DHP to the catalytically active ferric state. These observations provide a physiological link between the O(2) carrier role of the ferrous protein and the peroxidase activity of the ferric enzyme in this bifunctional protein. labels: #Globins'
b'The oligomeric state and kinetics of ligand binding were measured for wild-type cytoglobin. Cytoglobin has the classical globin fold, with an extension at each extremity of about 20 residues. The extended length of cytoglobin leads to an ambiguous interpretation of its oligomeric state. Although the hydrodynamic diameter corresponds to that of a dimer, it displays a mass of a single subunit, indicating a monomeric form. Thus, rather than displaying a compact globular form, cytoglobin behaves hydrodynamically like a tightly packed globin with a greater flexibility of the N- and C-terminal regions. Cytoglobin displays biphasic kinetics after the photolysis of CO, as a result of competition with an internal protein ligand, the E7 distal histidine. An internal disulfide bond may form which modifies the rate of dissociation of the distal histidine and apparently leads to different cytoglobin conformations, which may affect the observed oxygen affinity by an order of magnitude. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is proposed to be a neuron-specific, hypoxia-responsive, neuroprotective protein. However, results are conflicting concerning both Ngb's physiological and pathological significance. This study was designed to investigate the in vivo localization and regulation of Ngb in different neuropathological models representing traumatic injury, infectious, autoimmune, and excitotoxic pathogeneses. We profiled Ngb immunohistochemistry in murine models of traumatic brain injury, cerebral malaria, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, and kainic acid (KA)-mediated epileptic seizures that, to our knowledge, have not been studied in the context of Ngb. In control mice Ngb was expressed exclusively in neurons. In all pathological models except KA, in addition to neurons Ngb was present in reactive astrocytes. Ngb positive astrocytes were found within regions associated with most severe pathology and the astroglial scar. This is the first report of Ngb present in reactive astroglia and in scar-forming astrocytes in response to different pathological conditions relevant to human disease. In light of previously reported cyto-protective properties of Ngb, further insight may result in therapeutic ramifications. labels: #Globins"
b'Vascular endothelial growth factor, which is critical for blood vessel formation, is regulated by hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs). A component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) facilitates oxygen-dependent polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIFalpha subunits. Hypothesizing that deletion of podocyte VHL would result in HIFalpha hyperstabilization, we crossed podocin promoter-Cre transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase in podocytes beginning at the capillary loop stage of glomerular development, with floxed VHL mice. Vascular patterning and glomerular development appeared unaltered in progeny lacking podocyte VHL. However, urinalysis showed increased albumin excretion by 4 weeks when compared with wild-type littermates with several sever cases (>1000 microg/ml). Many glomerular ultrastructural changes were seen in mutants, including focal subendothelial delamination and widespread podocyte foot process broadening, and glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) were significantly thicker in 16-week-old mutants compared with controls. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy showed ectopic deposition of collagen alpha1alpha2alpha1(IV) in GBM humps beneath podocytes. Significant increases in the number of Ki-67-positive mesangial cells were also found, but glomerular WT1 expression was significantly decreased, signifying podocyte death and/or de-differentiation. Indeed, expression profiling of mutant glomeruli suggested a negative regulatory feedback loop involving the HIFalpha prolyl hydroxylase, Egln3. In addition, the brain oxygen-binding protein, Neuroglobin, was induced in mutant podocytes. We conclude that podocyte VHL is required for normal maintenance of podocytes, GBM composition and ultrastructure, and glomerular barrier properties. labels: #Globins'
b'Globins are heme-containing proteins that are best known for their roles in oxygen (O(2)) transport and storage. However, more diverse roles of globins in biology are being revealed, including gas and redox sensing. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, 33 globin or globin-like genes were recently identified, some of which are known to be expressed in the sensory neurons of the worm and linked to O(2) sensing behavior. Here, we describe GLB-6, a novel globin-like protein expressed in the neurons of C. elegans. Recombinantly expressed full-length GLB-6 contains a heme site with spectral features that are similar to those of other bis-histidyl ligated globins, such as neuroglobin and cytoglobin. In contrast to these globins, however, ligands such as CO, NO, and CN(-) do not bind to the heme in GLB-6, demonstrating that the endogenous histidine ligands are likely very tightly coordinated. Additionally, GLB-6 exhibits rapid two-state autoxidation kinetics in the presence of physiological O(2) levels as well as a low redox potential (-193 +/- 2 mV). A high-resolution (1.40 A) crystal structure of the ferric form of the heme domain of GLB-6 confirms both the putative globin fold and bis-histidyl ligation and also demonstrates key structural features that can be correlated with the unusual ligand binding and redox properties exhibited by the full-length protein. Taken together, the biochemical properties of GLB-6 suggest that this neural protein would most likely serve as a physiological sensor for O(2) in C. elegans via redox signaling and/or electron transfer. labels: #Globins'
b"Cytoglobin (Cygb) was investigated for its capacity to function as a NO dioxygenase (NOD) in vitro and in hepatocytes. Ascorbate and cytochrome b(5) were found to support a high NOD activity. Cygb-NOD activity shows respective K(m) values for ascorbate, cytochrome b(5), NO, and O(2) of 0.25 mm, 0.3 microm, 40 nm, and approximately 20 microm and achieves a k(cat) of 0.5 s(-1). Ascorbate and cytochrome b(5) reduce the oxidized Cygb-NOD intermediate with apparent second order rate constants of 1000 m(-1) s(-1) and 3 x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1), respectively. In rat hepatocytes engineered to express human Cygb, Cygb-NOD activity shows a similar k(cat) of 1.2 s(-1), a K(m)(NO) of 40 nm, and a k(cat)/K(m)(NO) (k'(NOD)) value of 3 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1), demonstrating the efficiency of catalysis. NO inhibits the activity at [NO]/[O(2)]ratios>1:500 and limits catalytic turnover. The activity is competitively inhibited by CO, is slowly inactivated by cyanide, and is distinct from the microsomal NOD activity. Cygb-NOD provides protection to the NO-sensitive aconitase. The results define the NOD function of Cygb and demonstrate roles for ascorbate and cytochrome b(5) as reductants. labels: #Globins"
b'KLF1 regulates a diverse suite of genes to direct erythroid cell differentiation from bipotent progenitors. To determine the local cis-regulatory contexts and transcription factor networks in which KLF1 operates, we performed KLF1 ChIP-seq in the mouse. We found at least 945 sites in the genome of E14.5 fetal liver erythroid cells which are occupied by endogenous KLF1. Many of these recovered sites reside in erythroid gene promoters such as Hbb-b1, but the majority are distant to any known gene. Our data suggests KLF1 directly regulates most aspects of terminal erythroid differentiation including production of alpha- and beta-globin protein chains, heme biosynthesis, coordination of proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways, and construction of the red cell membrane and cytoskeleton by functioning primarily as a transcriptional activator. Additionally, we suggest new mechanisms for KLF1 cooperation with other transcription factors, in particular the erythroid transcription factor GATA1, to maintain homeostasis in the erythroid compartment. labels: #Globins'
b'Defining the molecular mechanisms underpinning fetal (gamma) globin gene silencing may provide strategies for reactivation of gamma-gene expression, a major therapeutic objective in patients with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). We have previously demonstrated that symmetric methylation of histone H4 Arginine 3 (H4R3me2s) by the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 is required for recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A to the gamma-promoter, and subsequent DNA methylation and gene silencing. Here we show in an erythroid cell line, and in primary adult erythroid progenitors that PRMT5 induces additional repressive epigenetic marks at the gamma-promoter through the assembly of a multiprotein repressor complex containing the histone modifying enzymes SUV4-20h1, casein kinase 2alpha (CK2alpha), and components of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex. Expression of a mutant form of PRMT5 lacking methyltransferase activity or shRNA-mediated knockdown of SUV4-20h1 resulted in loss of complex binding to the gamma-promoter, reversal of both histone and DNA repressive epigenetic marks, and increased gamma-gene expression. The repressive H4K20me3 mark induced by SUV4-20h1 is enriched on the gamma-promoter in erythroid progenitors from adult bone marrow compared with cord blood, suggesting developmental specificity. These studies define coordinated epigenetic events linked to fetal globin gene silencing, and provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and SCD. labels: #Globins'
b"OBJECTIVE: To study the expression changes of neuroglobin in rats with the model of diffuse traumatic brain injury and explore the relationship between the neuroglobin and neuron apoptosis in traumatic brain injury.METHODS: The diffuse traumatic brain injury of rats was induced by the Marmarou's 'weight-drop' device. And the immunohistochemical technique was used to detect the expression changes of neuroglobin and neuron apoptosis in rat brain at different time points post-injury.RESULTS: The expression of neuroglobin increased twice and reached peaks at 2 hours and 72 hours post-injury respectively. And the increased expression of neuroglobin from 30 minutes to 1 hour post-injury and from 48 hours to 72 hours post-injury accompanied with the decreased expression ratio of Bax to Bcl-2.CONCLUSION: The increased expression of neuroglobin in traumatic brain injury informed us that neuroglobin had anti-apoptosis action in post-injury neuron. It could protect the neuron from traumatic stress and secondary ischemia and hypoxia insults during ultra-early and acute stages. labels: #Globins"
b'The use of mouse blood as a model for human blood is often considered in the development of clinically relevant, gene expression-based disease biomarkers. However, the ability to derive biologically meaningful insights from microarray-based gene expression patterns in mouse whole blood, as in human whole blood, is hindered by high levels of globin mRNA. In order to characterize the effects of globin reduction on gene expression of peripheral mouse blood, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on genes identified as expressed in blood via microarray-based genome-wide transcriptome analysis. Depletion of globin mRNA enhanced the quality of microarray data as shown by improved gene expression detection and increased sensitivity. Compared to genes expressed in whole blood, genes detected as expressed in blood following globin reduction were enriched for low abundance transcripts implicated in many biological pathways, including development, g-protein signaling, and immune response. Broadly, globin reduction resulted in improved detection of expressed genes that serve as molecular binding proteins and enzymes in cellular metabolism, intracellular transport/localization, transcription, and translation, as well as genes that potentially could act as biomarkers for diseases such as schizophrenia. These significantly enriched pathways overlap considerably with those identified in globin-reduced human blood suggesting that globin-reduced mouse blood gene expression studies may be useful for identifying genes relevant to human disease. Overall, the results of this investigation provide a better understanding of the impact of reducing globin transcripts in mouse blood and highlight the potential of microarray-based, globin-reduced, mouse blood gene expression studies in biomarker development. labels: #Globins'
b'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression that play an important role in hematopoiesis. Thalassemia, a defective globin synthesis leading to precipitate of excess unbound globins in red blood cell precursors, results in defective erythroid precursors and ineffective erythropoiesis. Expression pattern of miR-451, an erythroid-specific miRNA, was analyzed during differentiation of erythroid progenitors derived from normal and thalassemic peripheral blood CD34-positive cells, after 14 days of culture. A biphasic expression with transient up-regulation of miRNA-451 on day 3 of cultures was observed during thalassemic erythroid differentiation. In contrast, the expression pattern of the miR-451 in erythroid cells obtained from the other extravascular hemolytic anemia, i.e., hereditary spherocytosis patients showed no transient up-regulation of miR-451 on day 3 of cultures. Our results suggest that early erythroid progenitors in beta-thalassemia have a dysregulated miRNA-451 expression program, and analysis of microRNA is a relevant approach to determine abnormalities of erythropoiesis. labels: #Globins'
b'Erythropoietin (EPO) exerts (renal) tissue protective effects. Since it is unclear whether this is a direct effect of EPO on the kidney or not, we investigated whether EPO is able to protect human renal tubular epithelial cells (hTECs) from oxidative stress and if so which pathways are involved. EPO (epoetin delta) could protect hTECs against oxidative stress by a dose-dependent inhibition of reactive oxygen species formation. This protective effect is possibly related to the membranous expression of the EPO receptor (EPOR) since our data point to the membranous EPOR expression as a prerequisite for this protective effect. Oxidative stress reduction went along with the upregulation of renoprotective genes. Whilst three of these, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), aquaporin-1 (AQP-1), and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) have already been associated with EPO-induced renoprotection, this study for the first time suggests carboxypeptidase M (CPM), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), and cytoglobin (Cygb) to play a role in this process. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a globin found in the vertebrate brain. Recently, we found that zebrafish Ngb can translocate into cells and clarified that module M1 of zebrafish Ngb is important for protein transduction. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues of module M1 that are important for protein transduction. We show that Lys7, Lys9, Lys21, and Lys23 of zebrafish Ngb are crucial for its activity. Since these residues are conserved among fishes, but not among mammals, birds, or amphibians, the ability to penetrate cell membranes may be a unique characteristic of fish Ngb proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'Preliminary findings of various types of globin expressed in the respiratory bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium prompted us to compare the expression of erythropoietin (Epo) and its receptor (EpoR) in normal (healthy) human lung tissues with that in malignant lung tissues. The expression of Epo and EpoR was examined at the transcriptional and protein levels in normal and malignant lung tissues by reverse transcription-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses. EpoR mRNA, but not Epo mRNA, was detected in all samples. In normal tissues, EpoR was detected in the mesothelium, chondrocytes, alveolar cells, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle fibers, macrophages, and neutrophils, while in malignant foci, the cancer cells of five malignant types showed various intensities of EpoR immunoreactivity. The pattern of staining of EpoR protein was generally stronger in the malignant tissues than in the normal samples. Phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK1/2) was frequently seen in malignant cells, but not in the normal tissues, with the exception of macrophages. Based on the expression of Epo and EpoR mRNA with the EpoR in almost all cell components in normal tissues, we suggest that the normal lung may produce various types of globin through the autocrine and/or paracrine role of Epo. When the Epo signal is upregulated by hypoxic stress, the normal cells appear to transform into malignant cells and proliferate through activated MAPK signaling. labels: #Globins'
b"Cultured neurons tolerate low H(2)O(2) concentrations (<or =50 microM) through the activity of constitutive antioxidant response elements (ARE). At H(2)O(2) levels (>or =100 microM), neurons increase expression of the gene encoding for inducible hemoxygenase-1 while superoxide dismutase-2 and catalase remain unchanged. Despite this adaptive response, the endogenous antioxidant systems are overwhelmed, leading to decreased viability. Elevating the neuronal cell content of human neuroglobin (Ngb) prior to insult with 100 or 200 microM H(2)O(2) enhanced cell viability and this resulted in a significant decrease in oxidative stress and an increase in the intracellular ATP concentration, whereas in parental cells exposed to the same H(2)O(2)-insult, oxidative stress and ATP increased and decreased, respectively. The mechanism for this increase in ATP involves sustained activation of the mito-K(ATP) channel and an increase in phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Pharmacological inhibitors directed toward PI3K (wortmannin and LY294002), or the mito-K(ATP) channel (glybenclamide) inhibited the H(2)O(2)-mediated increase in ATP in cells overexpressing human Ngb and consequently cell viability decreased. Neuroglobin's ability to bolster the intracellular pool of ATP in response to added H(2)O(2) is central to the preservation of cytoskeletal integrity and cell viability. labels: #Globins"
b'BACKGROUND: The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains more than 30 putative globin genes that all are transcribed. Although their translated amino acid sequences fit the globin fold, a variety of amino-acid substitutions and extensions generate a wide structural diversity among the putative globins. No information is available on the physicochemical properties and the in vivo expression.RESULTS: We expressed the globins in a bacterial system, characterized the purified proteins by optical and resonance Raman spectroscopy, measured the kinetics and equilibria of O2 binding and determined the crystal structure of GLB-1* (CysGH2 -->Ser mutant). Furthermore, we studied the expression patterns of glb-1 (ZK637.13) and glb-26 (T22C1.2) in the worms using green fluorescent protein technology and measured alterations of their transcript abundances under hypoxic conditions.GLB-1* displays the classical three-over-three alpha-helical sandwich of vertebrate globins, assembled in a homodimer associated through facing E- and F-helices. Within the heme pocket the dioxygen molecule is stabilized by a hydrogen bonded network including TyrB10 and GlnE7.GLB-1 exhibits high ligand affinity, which is, however, lower than in other globins with the same distal TyrB10-GlnE7 amino-acid pair. In the absence of external ligands, the heme ferrous iron of GLB-26 is strongly hexacoordinated with HisE7, which could explain its extremely low affinity for CO. This globin oxidizes instantly to the ferric form in the presence of oxygen and is therefore incapable of reversible oxygen binding.CONCLUSION: The presented data indicate that GLB-1 and GLB-26 belong to two functionally-different globin classes. labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral hypoxia, and therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, to date an association between genetic variation within the human neuroglobin (NGB) gene and recovery post-TBI has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between NGB genotypes and outcomes (as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS], the Disability Rating Scale [DRS], and the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised [NRS-R]) after severe TBI. Genotyping using TaqMan allele discrimination for two tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) that represent the two haplotype blocks for NGB (rs3783988 and rs10133981) was completed on DNA obtained from 196 Caucasian patients recovering from severe TBI. Patients were dichotomized based on the presence of the variant allele for each tSNP. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare characteristics between groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine NGB tSNPs and recovery from severe TBI. Subjects with the TT genotype (wild-type) for rs3783988 were more likely to have better GOS and DRS scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, while rs10133981 genotype was not significantly related to functional outcome. After controlling for age, gender, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, those subjects with the rs3783988 TT genotype had more than a 2.65-times greater likelihood of better functional outcomes than individuals with genotypes harboring a variant allele. Data suggest that the haplotype block represented by rs3783988 in NGB appears to influence recovery after severe TBI. Represented within this haplotype block of NGB is the region that codes for the oxygen-binding portion of NGB. labels: #Globins"
b'The present study aimed at characterizing the anatomical and subcellular localization of cytoglobin (Cygb) and neuroglobin (Ngb) in the mouse brain by use of in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Cygb and Ngb were only found in distinct brain areas and often in the same areas. We found intense staining in the piriform cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus (medial preoptic area, supra chiasmatic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus (LH), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and the arcuate nucleus, habenular nuclei, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), locus coeruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In addition Cygb is found in the hippocampus, the reticular thalamic nucleus, and the dorsal raphe nucleus; Ngb is found in the sub parabrachial nucleus. Co-localization of Cygb and Ngb is mainly observed in the LDTg and PPTg. Cygb and Ngb were found in cytoplasm, along neurotubuli, in mitochondria and in the nucleus by use of immunoelectron microscopy. Most neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-positive neurons were found to co-localize Cygb, although not all nNOS neurones contain Cygb. Ngb co-localize with almost all orexin neurons in the LH. In conclusion the distribution of Cygb and Ngb seems much more restricted and coherent than previously reported. We believe other functions than pure oxygen buffers and neuroprotectants should be considered. The anatomical data indicate a role in NO signalling for Cygb and involvement in sleep-wake cycling for Cygb and Ngb. labels: #Globins'
b'The expression of neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb), two recently discovered globins with a potential neuroprotective activity against hypoxia and oxidative stress, was investigated in the cerebellum of young rats (postnatal day 20) after being exposed to chronic mild carbon monoxide (CO) at 25 ppm during prenatal (group A), prenatal and postnatal (group B), the postnatal period only (group C), and air (group D). The expression of genes associated with hypoxia signaling pathways was also investigated in the rat cerebella by real-time RT-PCR after CO exposure. Ngb and Cygb mRNAs did not change in any CO-exposed group. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed no significant change in Ngb protein; however, there was a significant increase of Cygb protein in rats from groups A, B, and C when compared with group D. In group B, genes related to the generation of reactive oxygen species (Nos2) and lipid metabolism (Apat2) were upregulated. In contrast, no changes were found in the expression of 8 genes typically upregulated by hypoxic conditions (Angptl4, Arnt2, Casp1, Crebbp, Hif1a, Hif3a, Mt3, or Vegfa) in any CO-exposed group, suggesting that hypoxia-related gene expression is not altered by this mild CO exposure. Cygb but not Ngb may protect cerebellar cells from the chronic presence of CO exposure during prenatal and postnatal development. labels: #Globins'
b'pH-induced unfolding and refolding of apo-neuroglobin (apo-Ngb) were investigated by UV, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectra and light scattering measurements. Results revealed that apo-Ngb became partially unfolded at around pH 5.0, with evidences from a red shift in the fluorescence spectra, a decrease in the far-UV CD and a sharp peak in the light scattering intensity. Further lowering of the pH reversed these effects, suggesting that apo-Ngb folds back to a compact state. At pH 2.0, the apo-Ngb forms a folding intermediate known as molten globule (MG), which is possessed of native-like secondary structure and almost complete loss of tertiary structure. Based on these results, the acid-induced denaturation pathway of apo-Ngb can be illustrated from the native state (N), via a partially unfolded state (U(A)) to the molten globule state (MG). labels: #Globins'
b'In this chapter, we describe numerous methods to extract RNA, DNA, and protein from tissue, represented by kidney transplant biopsies, and from peripheral blood cells collected at various clinical sites. Gene expression profiling and SNP-based genome-wide association studies are done using various microarray platforms. In addition, protocols that enable simultaneous protein purification from these clinical samples, enable additional strategies for understanding of the molecular processes involved in organ transplantation, immunosuppressive drug regimens, and the elements determining allograft success and failure. Successfully establishing a multicenter clinical study was essential to meet our objectives for subject enrollment and transplant outcomes. This chapter focuses on our experience setting up and coordinating clinical sample collection from multiple transplant centers for the purpose of microarray analysis. labels: #Globins'
b'The crystal structures of two pro-11S globulins namely: rapeseed procruciferin and pea prolegumin are presented here. We have extensively compared them with the other known structures of plant seed 11S and 7S globulins. In general, the disordered regions in the crystal structures among the 11S globulins correspond to their five variable regions. Variable region III of procruciferin is relatively short and is in a loop conformation. This region is highly disordered in other pro-11S globulin crystals. Local helical and strand variations also occur across the group despite general structure conservation. We showed how these variations may alter specific physicochemical, functional and physiological properties. Aliphatic hydrophobic residues on the molecular surface correlate well with Tm values of the globulins. We also considered other structural features that were reported to influence thermal stability but no definite conclusion was drawn since each factor has additive or subtractive effect. Comparison between proA3B4 and mature A3B4 revealed an increase in r.m.s.d. values near variable regions II and IV. Both regions are on the IE face. Secondary structure based alignment of 11S and 7S globulins revealed 16 identical residues. Based on proA3B4 sequence, Pro60, Gly128, Phe163, Phe208, Leu213, Leu227, Ile237, Pro382, Val404, Pro425 and Val 466 are involved in trimer formation and stabilization. Gly28, Gly74, Asp135, Gly349 and Gly397 are involved in correct globular folding. labels: #Globins'
b'The distribution of neuroglobin (Ngb) was investigated in the normal rat cochlea using immunohistochemistry and non-radioactive insitu hybridization. We also determined whether chronic, very mild CO exposure at 25ppm in air over the gestational and postnatal period alters the expression of Ngb. Pregnant rats were exposed chronically to CO from gestational days 5-20. Four groups were made as follows: prenatal exposure to CO only; prenatal exposure to CO followed by postnatal exposure from postnatal days (5) P5 to P20; rat pups were exposed to CO from P5 to P20; controls (air without CO). In normal adult rats and control group pups, Ngb was found in spiral ganglia neurons, fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, and supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Ngb was not present in the stria vascularis and the inner and outer hair cells. At P20 Ngb immunoreactivity and transcript expression decreased in spiral ganglia neurons and the spiral ligament in the prenatal and pre- and postnatal groups. This decrease was not observed in the postnatal group. Ngb-IR did not decrease in supporting cells in any CO group. Cytochrome-C immunoreactivity followed Ngb distribution in normal controls and CO treated groups. A decrease in Ngb in spiral ganglia neurons and rat spiral ligament, but not in supporting cells, following CO exposure supports the idea that chronic, mild exposure to CO may create a vulnerable cellular environment predisposed to adverse cochlear development. labels: #Globins'
b'The present study describes a rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the detection of human globin chains in blood. The method involves direct injection of globin chains which prepared by a standard method onto a micro bondapack C18 reversed-phase column (7.8 mm I.D.) with UV detection at 280 nm. The detection limit of hemoglobin (Hb) was 0.1 \xce\xbcg, which is equivalent to about 1 ml of fresh whole blood. We report here the rapid procedure for globin chain analysis. The present method will be useful for the determination of globin chain analysis in clinical laboratories, as well as in thalassemia and sickle cell disease patients. labels: #Globins'
b'Spi-1/PU.1 oncogene is downregulated as proerythroblasts undergo terminal differentiation. Insertion of the Friend virus upstream of the Spi-1/PU.1 locus leads to the constitutive upregulation of Spi-1/PU.1, and a subsequent block in the differentiation of the affected erythroblasts. We have shown that sustained overexpression of Spi-1/PU.1 also inhibits the erythroid splicing of protein 4.1R exon 16, irrespective of chemical induction of differentiation. Here, we show a positive feedback loop that couples constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to high expression of Spi-1/PU.1 in Friend erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT results in Spi-1/PU.1 downregulation in a stepwise manner and induces cell differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further supported the positive autoregulatory effect of Spi-1/PU.1. Mutational analysis indicated that Ser41, but not Ser148, is necessary for Spi-1/PU.1-mediated repression of hemoglobin expression, whereas both Ser residues are required for Spi-1/PU.1 inhibition of the erythroid splicing event. We further show that inhibition of the erythroid transcriptional and splicing events are strictly dependent on distinct Spi-1/PU.1 phosphorylation modifications rather than Spi-1/PU.1 expression level per se. Our data further support the fact that Spi-1/PU.1 inhibits 4.1R erythroid splicing through two different pathways, and bring new insights into the extracellular signal impact triggered by erythropoietin on late erythroid regulatory program, including pre-mRNA splicing. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a myoglobin-like (Mb) heme-globin, belonging the globin family located only in neuronal tissue of the central nervous system. Ngb has been shown to be upregulated in and to protect neurons from hypoxic and ischemic injury, but the function of Ngb-in particular how Ngb may protect neurons-remains largely elusive. We have previously described the localization of Ngb in the rat brain and found it to be expressed in areas primarily involved in sleep/wake, circadian, and food regulation. The present study was undertaken, using immunohistochemistry, to characterize the localization, colocalization, innervation, and response to light of Ngb-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Our results demonstrate that the majority of Ngb-expressing neurons in the SCN belong to a cell group not previously characterized by neurotransmitter content; only a small portion was found to co-store GRP in the ventral SCN. Furthermore, some Ngb-containing neurons were responsive to light stimulation at late night evaluated by the induction of cFOS and only a few cells were found to express the core clock gene PER1 during the 24-hour light/dark cycle. The Ngb-containing cells received input from neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing nerve fibers of the geniticulo-hypothalamic tract (GHT), whereas no direct input from the eye or the midbrain raphe system was demonstrated. The results indicate that the Ngb could be involved in both photic and nonphotic entrainment via input from the GHT. labels: #Globins'
b'Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a technique capable of determining the hydrodynamic radius of proteins. From this parameter, a molecular weight can be assessed provided that an appropriate calibration curve is available. To this goal, a globin-based calibration curve was used to determine the polymerization state of a recombinant hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier and to assess the equivalent molecular weight of hemoglobins conjugated with polyethylene glycol molecules. The good agreement between DLS values and those obtained from gel filtration chromatography is a consequence of the high similarity in structure, shape, and density within the globin superfamily. Moreover, globins and heme proteins in general share similar spectroscopic properties, thereby reducing possible systematic errors associated with the absorption of the probe radiation by the chromophore. labels: #Globins'
b'Modeling the interplay between mutation and selection at the molecular level is key to evolutionary studies. To this end, codon-based evolutionary models have been proposed as pertinent means of studying long-range evolutionary patterns and are widely used. However, these approaches have not yet consolidated results from amino acid level phylogenetic studies showing that selection acting on proteins displays strong site-specific effects, which translate into heterogeneous amino acid propensities across the columns of alignments; related codon-level studies have instead focused on either modeling a single selective context for all codon columns, or a separate selective context for each codon column, with the former strategy deemed too simplistic and the latter deemed overparameterized. Here, we integrate recent developments in nonparametric statistical approaches to propose a probabilistic model that accounts for the heterogeneity of amino acid fitness profiles across the coding positions of a gene. We apply the model to a dozen real protein-coding gene alignments and find it to produce biologically plausible inferences, for instance, as pertaining to site-specific amino acid constraints, as well as distributions of scaled selection coefficients. In their account of mutational features as well as the heterogeneous regimes of selection at the amino acid level, the modeling approaches studied here can form a backdrop for several extensions, accounting for other selective features, for variable population size, or for subtleties of mutational features, all with parameterizations couched within population-genetic theory. labels: #Globins'
b'Activin A is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Using the p38 inhibitor SB203580, our previous studies demonstrated that p38 was involved in activin A-mediated hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis in K562 cells. SB203580 is an inhibitor of p38alpha and p38beta isoforms. In this study, we show that p38alpha and p38beta mRNA were expressed in K562 cells and that activin A activated the kinase activities of these isoforms. To investigate the roles of p38alpha and p38beta isoforms in activin A-mediated erythroid differentiation, we generated stable clones that over-expressed the dominant negative p38 isoforms p38alpha(AF) and p38beta(AF) in K562 cells. The expressions of either p38alpha(AF) or p38beta(AF) reduced activin A-induced p38 activation, Hb synthesis, and zeta-globin promoter activity. Similarly, down-regulation of either p38alpha or p38beta by isoform-specific siRNAs also reduced activin A-induced zeta-globin promoter activity. Co-expressions of p38alpha(AF) and p38beta(AF), together, greatly inhibited the transcription activity of the zeta-globin promoter. Conversely, expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) 6b(E), a constitutive activator of p38, significantly activated zeta-globin promoter. Co-expressions of either p38alpha or p38beta with MKK6b had a similar activation of zeta-globin promoter. Activin A induction of erythroid differentiation was inhibited by follistatin. Activin A-induced phosphorylation of MKK6 and p38 was also inhibited by follistatin. Moreover, over-expression of MKK6b(E) reverted follistatin inhibition of activin A-induced zeta-globin promoter activity. These results demonstrate that activin A induces erythroid differentiation of K562 cells through activation of MKK6-p38alpha/p38beta pathway and follistatin inhibits those effects. labels: #Globins'
b'A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment (msa) of proteins. In the model, each column of symbols in the alignment is represented by a frequency distribution of the symbols (called a "state"), and insertions and deletions are represented by other states. One moves through the model along a particular path from state to state in a Markov chain (i.e., random choice of next move), trying to match a given sequence. The next matching symbol is chosen from each state, recording its probability (frequency) and also the probability of going to that state from a previous one (the transition probability). State and transition probabilities are multiplied to obtain a probability of the given sequence. The hidden nature of the HMM is due to the lack of information about the value of a specific state, which is instead represented by a probability distribution over all possible values. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of HMMs in msa and presents algorithms for calculating an HMM and the conditions for producing the best HMM. labels: #Globins'
b'Finding a global optimal alignment of more than two sequences that includes matches, mismatches, and gaps and that takes into account the degree of variation in all of the sequences at the same time is especially difficult. The dynamic programming algorithm used for optimal alignment of pairs of sequences can be extended to global alignment of three sequences, but for more than three sequences, only a small number of relatively short sequences may be analyzed. Thus, approximate methods are used for global sequence alignment. One class of these methods is progressive global alignment, which starts with an alignment of the most alike sequences and then builds an alignment by adding more sequences. This article introduces three programs that use progressive alignment methodology. labels: #Globins'
b'AIMS: Leu-Ser-Glu-Leu (LSEL) is the main active ingredient of globin digest (GD) that has an anti-diabetic effect. Here, we investigated the anti-diabetic effect of LSEL for the first time.MAIN METHODS: The anti-diabetic effects of GD and LSEL in ICR mice, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and KK-Ay mice were examined.KEY FINDINGS: GD and LSEL suppressed the elevation of blood glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in ICR mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice and KK-Ay mice as well as in an oral sucrose tolerance test in ICR mice and in an insulin tolerance test (ITT) in KK-Ay mice. GD and LSEL decreased the blood glucose levels in the basal state in STZ-induced diabetic mice and KK-Ay mice. Furthermore, GD and LSEL elevated the serum insulin levels in an OGTT in ICR mice and KK-Ay mice and promoted the use of insulin in an ITT in KK-Ay mice. GD and LSEL increased the translocation or expression of the glucose transporter 4 in the muscle of ICR mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice and KK-Ay mice and increased the expression of the uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in the muscle of ICR mice.SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that GD and LSEL control blood glucose through the promotion of glucose uptake in the muscle of the mice. The acceleration of glucose uptake by GD and LSEL may be controlled by the promotion of insulin secretion and the up-regulation of UCP2 expression. GD and LSEL seem to be useful for lowering the incidence of hyperglycemia. labels: #Globins'
b"In the past few years, overwhelming evidence has accrued that a high level of expression of the protein neuroglobin protects neurons in vitro, in animal models, and in humans, against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective action has not been determined. Using cell biology and biochemical approaches we demonstrate that neuroglobin inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in vitro and intervenes in activation of pro-caspase 9 by interaction with cytochrome c. Using systems level information of the apoptotic signalling reactions we have developed a quantitative model of neuroglobin inhibition of apoptosis, which simulates neuroglobin blocking of apoptosome formation at a single cell level. Furthermore, this model allows us to explore the effect of neuroglobin in conditions not easily accessible to experimental study. We found that the protection of neurons by neuroglobin is very concentration sensitive. The impact of neuroglobin may arise from both its binding to cytochrome c and its subsequent redox reaction, although the binding alone is sufficient to block pro-caspase 9 activation. These data provides an explanation the action of neuroglobin in the protection of nerve cells from unwanted apoptosis. labels: #Globins"
b'In the present work, density functional theory and canonical nonadiabatic Monte Carlo transition state theory have been used to investigate the histidine dissociation process from hexacoordinate heme in Ngb protein. The potential energy surfaces (PES) of the lowest singlet, triplet, and quintet states are calculated by stepwise optimization along with the histidine dissociation pathway. Based on the calculated two-dimensional PES, the histidine dissociation rates for the spin-forbidden processes via singlet to triplet and singlet to quintet transitions have been calculated by the nonadiabatic Monte Carlo transition state theory in canonical ensemble. The present study provides a quantitative description on spin-forbidden histidine dissociation processes. labels: #Globins'
b'In chronic liver diseases, the accumulation of extracellular matrix leading to fibrosis is caused by myofibroblasts, the origins of which are debatable. We performed a comparative proteomic study to identify markers and gain insight into distinct functions of myofibroblasts derived either from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) or from portal mesenchymal cells. After isolation from normal liver and culture in similar conditions, myofibroblastic HSCs (MF-HSCs) presented enlarged cytoplasms whereas portal myofibroblasts (PMFs) were more proliferative, and formed more stress fibers. The two cell types were subjected to comparative analyses by 2-D MS/MS. Six proteins were overexpressed in PMFs, with myofibroblast-related typical functions. Among them, cofilin-1 showed the greatest difference in expression and a lower pI than expected. Immunoblot demonstrated higher levels of phosphorylation, a modification of the protein implicated in stress fiber formation. Eleven proteins, mostly involved in stress response, were overexpressed in MF-HSCs. Cytoglobin had the highest level of overexpression, as confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. These results identify cytoglobin as the best marker for distinguishing MF-HSCs from PMFs and suggest different functions for the two cell populations in the liver wound healing response, with a prominent role for PMFs in scar formation. labels: #Globins'
b'The geometrical configurations of atoms in protein structures can be viewed as approximate relations among them. Then, finding similar common substructures within a set of protein structures belongs to a new class of problems that generalizes that of finding repeated motifs. The novelty lies in the addition of constraints on the motifs in terms of relations that must hold between pairs of positions of the motifs. We will hence denote them as relational motifs. For this class of problems, we present an algorithm that is a suitable extension of the KMR paradigm and, in particular, of the KMRC as it uses a degenerate alphabet. Our algorithm contains several improvements that become especially useful when-as it is required for relational motifs-the inference is made by partially overlapping shorter motifs, rather than concatenating them. The efficiency, correctness and completeness of the algorithm is ensured by several non-trivial properties that are proven in this paper. The algorithm has been applied in the important field of protein common 3D substructure searching. The methods implemented have been tested on several examples of protein families such as serine proteases, globins and cytochromes P450 additionally. The detected motifs have been compared to those found by multiple structural alignments methods. labels: #Globins'
b'The discovery of interchromosomal interactions in higher eukaryotes points to a functional interplay between genome architecture and gene expression, challenging the view of transcription as a one-dimensional process. However, the extent of interchromosomal interactions and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we present the first genome-wide analysis of transcriptional interactions using the mouse globin genes in erythroid tissues. Our results show that the active globin genes associate with hundreds of other transcribed genes, revealing extensive and preferential intra- and interchromosomal transcription interactomes. We show that the transcription factor Klf1 mediates preferential co-associations of Klf1-regulated genes at a limited number of specialized transcription factories. Our results establish a new gene expression paradigm, implying that active co-regulated genes and their regulatory factors cooperate to create specialized nuclear hot spots optimized for efficient and coordinated transcriptional control. labels: #Globins'
b'In sickle cell disease (SCD), the events originating from hemoglobin S polymerization and intravascular sickling lead to reperfusion injury, hemolysis, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is implicated as a contributing factor to multiple organ damage in SCD. We hypothesize that inhibition of sickling by genetic manipulation to enhance antisickling fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression will have an ameliorating effect on oxidative stress by decreasing intravascular sickling and hemolysis and enhancing NO bioavailability. We tested this hypothesis in BERK (Berkeley) mice expressing exclusively human alpha- and beta(S)-globins and varying levels of HbF, i.e., BERK (<1% HbF), BERKgammaM (20% HbF) and BERKgammaH (40% HbF). Intravascular sickling showed a distinct decrease with increased expression of HbF, which was accompanied by decreased hemolysis and increased NO metabolites (NO(x)) levels. Consistent with decreased intravascular sickling and increased NO bioavailability, BERKgammaM and BERKgammaH mice showed markedly decreased lipid peroxidation accompanied by increased activity/levels of antioxidants [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH)] in the muscle, kidney, and liver compared with BERK mice (P<0.05-0.0001). NO(x) levels showed a strong inverse correlation with hemolytic rate and oxidative stress. Decreased oxidative stress in the presence of elevated HbF levels led to an anti-inflammatory effect as evidenced by decreased peripheral leukocyte counts. These results show that the protective effect of HbF is mediated primarily by decreasing intravascular sickling resulting in decreased oxidative stress and increased NO bioavailability. labels: #Globins'
b'The structural origins of infrared absorptions of photodissociated CO in murine neuroglobin (Ngb) are determined by combining Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Such an approach allows to identify and characterize both the different conformations of the Ngb active site and the transient ligand docking sites. To capture the influence of the protein environment on the spectroscopy and dynamics, experiments and simulations are carried out for the wild type protein and its F28L and F28W mutants. It is found that a voluminous side chain at position 28 divides site B into two subsites, B\' and B". At low temperatures, CO in wt Ngb only migrates to site B\' from where it can rebind, and B" is not populated. The spectra of CO in site B\' for wt Ngb from simulations and experiments are very similar in spectral shift and shape. They both show doublets, red-shifted with respect to gas-phase CO and split by approximately 8 cm(-1). The FTIR spectra of the F28L mutant show additional bands which are also found in the simulations and can be attributed to CO located in substate B". The different bands are mainly related to different orientations of the His64 side chain with respect to the CO ligand. Large red-shifts arise from strong interactions between the Histidine-NH and the CO oxygen. After dissociation from the heme iron, the CO ligand visits multiple docking sites. The locations of the primary docking site B and a secondary site C, which corresponds to the Mb Xe4 cavity, could be identified unambiguously. Finally, by comparing experiment and simulations it is also possible to identify protonation of its epsilon position (His(epsilon)64 NgbCO) as the preferred heme-bound conformation in the wild type protein with a signal at 1935 cm(-1). labels: #Globins'
b"Neuroglobin (Ngb), a recently discovered member of the globin family, is overexpressed in the brain tissues over oxygen deprivation. Unlike more classical globins, such as myoglobin and hemoglobin, it is characterized by a hexacoordinated heme, and its physiological role is still unknown, despite the numerous investigations made on the protein in recent years. Another important specific feature of human Ngb is the presence of two cysteine residues (Cys46 and Cys55), which are known to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge. Since previous work on human Ngb reported that its ligand binding properties could be controlled by the coordination state of the Fe(2+) atom (in the heme moiety) and the redox state of the thiol groups, we choose to develop a simulation approach combining coarse-grain Brownian dynamics and all-atom molecular dynamics and metadynamics. We have studied the diffusion of small ligands (CO, NO, and O(2)) in the globin internal cavity network for various states of human Ngb. Our results show how the structural and mechanical properties of the protein can be related to the ligand migration pathway, which can be extensively modified when changing the thiol's redox state and the iron's coordination state. We suggest that ligand binding is favored in the pentacoordinated species bearing an internal disulfide bridge. labels: #Globins"
b'During the climax of amphibian metamorphosis many tadpole organs remodel. The different remodeling strategies are controlled by thyroid hormone (TH). The liver, skin, and tail fibroblasts shut off tadpole genes and activate frog genes in the same cell without DNA replication. We refer to this as "gene switching". In contrast, the exocrine pancreas and the intestinal epithelium dedifferentiate to a progenitor state and then redifferentiate to the adult cell type. Tadpole and adult globin are not present in the same cell. Switching from red cells containing tadpole-specific globin to those with frog globin in the liver occurs at a progenitor cell stage of development and is preceded by DNA replication. Red cell switching is the only one of these remodeling strategies that resembles a stem cell mechanism. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Ex vivo generated erythroblasts are being evaluated for transfusion. Expression of balanced levels of globin mRNA is essential for normal red blood cell function and survival but it is unknown whether the expression of the globin genes in ex vivo expanded cells is balanced.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Immature erythroblasts (IEs) were expanded in human erythroid massive amplification cultures from blood mononuclear cells of 19 normal donors and four beta(0)-thalassemia patients (for comparison) and induced to mature for 4 days in the presence of erythropoietin. mRNA was prepared from IEs and mature erythroblasts to evaluate the expression of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globin genes and of adult hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) and BCL11A, two proteins directly controlling globin function and/or production. Results were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, the Wilcoxon signed rank, and the Mann-Whitney rank sum tests.RESULTS: The absolute levels of globin, AHSP, and BCL11A mRNA expressed by erythroblasts generated ex vivo from normal donors were distributed along a 2-log range. With maturation, the levels of gamma-globin and BCL11A mRNA did not decrease while those of alpha-globin, gamma + beta-globins, and AHSP mRNA greatly increased. In normal cells, the modest imbalance (two- to fourfold) observed between alpha- and gamma + beta-globin mRNA was fully compensated by AHSP expression. Thus, the levels of alpha-globin mRNA were correlated with those of gamma + beta-globin (R(2) = 0.93, p<0.0001) and AHSP (R(2) = 0.86, p<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo expanded erythroblasts from normal donors express modestly imbalanced levels of alpha-globin and gamma + beta-globin fully compensated by AHSP expression, likely ensuring normal function and survival. labels: #Globins"
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered globin that is predominantly expressed in the brain, retina and other nerve tissues of human and other vertebrates. Ngb has been shown to act as a neuroprotective factor, promoting neuronal survival in conditions of hypoxic-ischemic insult, such as those occurring during stroke. In this work, the conformational and functional stability of Ngb at acidic pH was analyzed, and the results were compared to those obtained with Mb. It was shown by spectroscopic and biochemical (limited proteolysis) techniques that, at pH 2.0, apoNgb is a folded and rigid protein, retaining most of the structural features that the protein displays at neutral pH. Conversely, apoMb, under the same experimental conditions of acidic pH, is essentially a random coil polypeptide. Urea-mediated denaturation studies revealed that the stability displayed by apoNgb at pH 2.0 is very similar to that of Mb at pH 7.0. Ngb also shows enhanced functional stability as compared with Mb, being capable of heme binding over a more acidic pH range than Mb. Furthermore, Ngb reversibly binds oxygen at acidic pH, with an affinity that increases as the pH is decreased. It is proposed that the acid-stable fold of Ngb depends on the particular amino acid composition of the protein polypeptide chain. The functional stability at low pH displayed by Ngb was instead shown to be related to hexacoordination of the heme group. The biological implications of the unusual acid resistance of the folding and function of Ngb are discussed. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) belongs to the large family of globular heme proteins capable of binding small gaseous ligands such as O(2), CO, or NO within their active site. In this work, we have analyzed CO migration pathways in photolyzed NgbCO using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in combination with Fourier transform infrared temperature derivative spectroscopy (FTIR-TDS). A total of 55 ns of MD simulation was analyzed to explore the approximately 300 A(3) internal Ngb cavity. Overall, the simulations differentiated between eight possible docking sites, three of which were also identified experimentally. Low-temperature FTIR-TDS experiments on wild-type (wt) and F28W mutant NgbCO revealed that a small fraction of ligands migrates from site B to site C from which they rebound after slow cool illumination. For the F28L mutant, however, population of site C was not observed. In agreement with these findings, the simulations at 20 K showed ligand transfer between sites B and C for wt Ngb, but not for the F28L mutant. The ligand migration network could be mapped out and two key gate residues, Phe28 and Pro52, were identified. Ligand population analysis from the MD simulations revealed a direct relation between the size of the B10 side chain (Phe28 in wild-type Ngb) and the barrier against migration. Barriers for the transition of photodissociated CO from the distal pocket to the Xe4 site in Ngb are lower by up to 4 kcal/mol compared to myoglobin, suggesting that ligand migration between different docking sites is more facile in Ngb than in myoglobin. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb), a member of the globin superfamily, was found in the brain of vertebrates and is suggested to play a neuroprotective function under hypoxic conditions by scavenging nitrogen monoxide (NO) through a dioxygenase activity. In order for such a reaction to efficiently take place and to minimize the release of reactive intermediates in the cytosol, the cosubstrates O(2) and NO and other unstable reaction intermediates should bind sequentially to docking sites in the protein matrix. We have characterized the accessibility of these sites by analyzing the geminate CO rebinding kinetics to the heme moiety observed upon nanosecond flash photolysis of the Ngb-CO complex encapsulated in silica gels. The geminate rebinding phase showed a remarkable complexity, revealing the presence of a system of secondary docking sites where ligands are stored for hundreds of microseconds. Most kinetics steps display little temperature dependence, demonstrating that ligands can easily migrate through the cavities, except for the slowest reaction intermediate, possibly reflecting a structural conformational change reshaping the system of cavities. This conformational change is unrelated with distal His E7 binding to the heme, as it persists for the HE7L mutant. Overall, data are consistent with the presence of a discrete system of docking sites, possibly acting as reservoirs for the putative cosubstrates and for other reactive species involved in the physiologically relevant reaction. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin, a new member of hemoprotein family, can reversibly bind oxygen and take part in many biological processes such as enzymatic reaction, signal transduction and the mitochondria function. Different from myoglobin and hemoglobin, it has a hexacoordinated heme environment, with histidyl imidazole of proximal His(96)(F8) and distal His(64)(E7) directly bound to the metal ion. In the present work, solution (1)H NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the electronic structure of heme center of wild-type met-human neuroglobin. The resonances of heme protons and key residues in the heme pocket were assigned. Two heme orientations resulting from a 180 degrees rotation about the alpha-gamma-meso axis with a population ratio about 2:1 were observed. Then the (1)H NMR chemical shifts of the ferriheme methyl groups were used to predict orientations of the axial ligand. The obtained axial ligand plane angle phi is consistent with that from the molecular dynamics simulation but not with those from the crystal data. Compared with mouse neuroglobin, the obtained average ligand orientation of human neuroglobin reflects the changeability of heme environment for the Ngb family. labels: #Globins'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of neuroglobin (Ngb) in frontal cortex, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum in rats with brain injury induced by LPS and to elucidate its significance.METHODS: Seventy adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into LPS (n = 60, with injection of 0.1 mg/kg LPS into cistern) and control (C, n = 10, with injection of equal volume of isotonic saline into cistern) groups, with 10 rats in each group. The plasma, CSF as well as frontal cortex from sacrificed rats were collected in LPS group at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 post injection hour (PIH), with 10 rats at each time point. The protein expression of Ngb was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Expression of Ngb in frontal cortex was determined by SP. Water content of frontal cortex was assessed by drying method. The correlation among Ngb contents in serum, CSF, frontal cortex and water content of frontal cortex was analyzed with multiple comparison.RESULTS: Ngb expression (by ELISA): Ngb expression of frontal cortex, CSF, and serum in LPS group was higher than that in C group at each time point, and it peaked at48 PBH (35.4 +/- 3.9, 22.7 +/- 3.1, 14.4 +/- 2.8 ng/mL, respectively, P<0.01). Ngb expression (by Western blot): Ngb protein with relative molecular mass of 17 x 10(3) was observed in each group. Ngb expression detected by Western blot was similar to that detected by ELISA. Brain water content was significantly greater in LPS group than that of C group at 6-72 PIH (P<0.01), and it peaked at 48 PBH (83.3 +/- 1.9)%. Ngb contents in serum, CSF, frontal cortex, and water content of frontal cortex were positively correlated with multiple comparison ( y = 0.631-0.719, P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of Ngb expression in brain injury induced by LPS is correlated with duration after challenge of LPS. labels: #Globins'
b'The molecular clock hypothesis, stating that protein sequences diverge in evolution by accumulating amino acid substitutions at an almost constant rate, played a major role in the development of molecular evolution and boosted quantitative theories of evolutionary change. These studies were extended to protein structures by the seminal paper by Chothia and Lesk, which established the approximate proportionality between structure and sequence divergence. Here we analyse how function influences the relationship between sequence and structure divergence, studying four large superfamilies of evolutionarily related proteins: globins, aldolases, P-loop and NADP-binding. We introduce the contact divergence, which is more consistent with sequence divergence than previously used structure divergence measures. Our main findings are: (1) Small structure and sequence divergences are proportional, consistent with the molecular clock. Approximate validity of the clock is also supported by the analysis of the clustering coefficient of structure similarity networks. (2) Functional constraints strongly limit the structure divergence of proteins performing the same function and may allow to identify incomplete or wrong functional annotations. (3) The rate of structure versus sequence divergence is larger for proteins performing different functions than for proteins performing the same function. We conjecture that this acceleration is due to positive selection for new functions. Accelerations in structure divergence are also suggested by the analysis of the clustering coefficient. (4) For low sequence identity, structural diversity explodes. We conjecture that this explosion is related to functional diversification. (5) Large indels are almost always associated with function changes. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin, a member of vertebrate globin family, is distributed primarily in the brain and retina. Considerable evidence has accumulated regarding its unique ligand-binding properties, neural-specific distribution, distinct expression regulation, and possible roles in processes such as neuron protection and enzymatic metabolism. Structurally, neuroglobin enjoys unique features, such as bis-histidyl coordination to heme iron in the absence of exogenous ligand, heme orientational heterogeneity, and a heme sliding mechanism accompanying ligand binding. In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to reveal functional and structural information in three carboxyl murine neuroglobin mutants with single point mutations F106Y, F106L and F106I, respectively. The MD simulation indicates a remarkable proximal effect on detectable displacement of heme and a larger tunnel in the protein matrix. In addition, the mutation at F106 confers on the CD region a very sensitive mobility in all three model structures. The dynamic features of neuroglobin demonstrate rearrangement of the inner space and highly active loop regions in solution. These imply that the conserved residue at the G5 site plays a key role in the physiological function of this unusual protein. labels: #Globins'
b'For more than 30 years it was believed that globin gene domains included only genes encoding globin chains. Here we show that in chickens, the domain of alpha-globin genes also harbor the non-globin gene TMEM8. It was relocated to the vicinity of the alpha-globin cluster due to inversion of an approximately 170-kb genomic fragment. Although in humans TMEM8 is preferentially expressed in resting T-lymphocytes, in chickens it acquired an erythroid-specific expression profile and is upregulated upon terminal differentiation of erythroblasts. This correlates with the presence of erythroid-specific regulatory elements in the body of chicken TMEM8, which interact with regulatory elements of the alpha-globin genes. Surprisingly, TMEM8 is not simply recruited to the alpha-globin gene domain active chromatin hub. An alternative chromatin hub is assembled, which includes some of the regulatory elements essential for the activation of globin gene expression. These regulatory elements should thus shuttle between two different chromatin hubs. labels: #Globins'
b'We propose a new method to compare sequences of protein families by generating numerical characterizations through a 20D representation. Using a walk along the axes representing the amino acids we generate a vector for each sequence whose components can be used to derive distance matrices between sequences and whose magnitudes can be used to compare the similarities/dissimilarities between the different sequences. The distance matrices enable creation of phylogenetic trees without need for multiple alignments or any other model dependencies. In this paper we test this technique with human globin gene sequences and then apply the method to a contemporary issue of evolutionary relationships of rat and human voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunits and compare with published literature. The close match of the results demonstrates the reliability and ease of use of this method. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a hexacoordinate globin expressed in the nervous system of vertebrates, where it protects neurons against hypoxia. Ferrous Ngb has been proposed to favor cell survival by scavenging NO and/or reducing cytochrome c released into the cytosol during hypoxic stress. Both catalytic functions require an as yet unidentified Ngb-reductase activity. Such an activity was detected both in tissue homogenates of human brain and liver and in Escherichia coli extracts. Since NADH:flavorubredoxin oxidoreductase from E. coli, that was shown to reduce ferric Ngb, shares sequence similarity with the human apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), AIF has been proposed by us as a candidate Ngb reductase. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and show that the Ngb-reductase activity of recombinant human AIF is negligible and hence incompatible with such a physiological function. labels: #Globins'
b'Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory pigment in annelids. It can be intra or extracellular, and this latter type can form large multimeric complexes. The hydrothermal vent scale worms Branchipolynoe symmytilida and Branchipolynoe seepensis express an extracellular tetra-domain hemoglobin (Hb) that is unique in annelids. We sequenced the gene for the single-domain and tetra-domain globins in these two species. The single-domain gene codes for a mature protein of 137 amino acids, and the tetra-domain gene codes for a mature protein of 552 amino acids. The single-domain gene has a typical three exon/two intron structure, with introns located at their typical positions (B12.2 and G7.0). This structure is repeated four times in the tetra-domain gene, with no bridge introns or linker sequences between domains. The phylogenetic position of Branchipolynoe globins among known annelid globins revealed that, although extracellular, they cluster within the annelid intracellular globins clade, suggesting that the extracellular state of these Hbs is the result of convergent evolution. The tetra-domain structure likely resulted from two tandem duplications, domain 1 giving rise to domain 2 and after this the two-domain gene duplicated to produce domains 3 and 4. The high O(2) affinity of Branchipolynoe extracellular globins may be explained by the two key residues (B10Y and E7Q) in the heme pocket in each of the domains of the single and tetra-domain globins, which have been shown to be essential in the oxygen-avid Hb from the nematode Ascaris suum. This peculiar globin evolutionary path seems to be very different from other annelid extracellular globins and is most likely the product of evolutionary tinkering associated with the strong selective pressure to adapt to chronic hypoxia that characterizes hydrothermal vents. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a hexacoordinate globin expressed in the brain of vertebrates. Ferrous Ngb binds dioxygen with high affinity and the O(2) adduct is able to scavenge NO. Convincing in vitro and in vivo data indicate that Ngb is involved in neuroprotection during hypoxia and ischemia. The 3D structure of Ngb reveals the presence of a wide internal cavity connecting its heme active site with the bulk. To explore the role of this "tunnel" in the control of ligand binding, we determined the structure of metNgb and NgbCO equilibrated with Xe or Kr. We show four docking sites for Xe (only two for Kr); two of the four Xe sites are within the large cavity. They are only partially conserved in globins, since the two proximal Xe sites identified in myoglobin (Xe1 and Xe2) are absent in Ngb, as well as in cytoglobin. The Xe docking sites in Ngb map a pathway within the protein matrix, leading to the heme, which becomes more accessible in the ligand-bound species. This may be of significance in connection with the redox chemistry that may be the primary function of this hexacoordinate globin. labels: #Globins'
b'It was recently found that the lowest-energy collective normal modes dominate the evolutionary divergence of protein structures. This was attributed to a presumed functional importance of such motions, i.e., to natural selection. In contrast to this selectionist explanation, we proposed that the observed behavior could be just the expected physical response of proteins to random mutations. This proposal was based on the success of a linearly forced elastic network model (LFENM) of mutational effects on structure to account for the observed pattern of structural divergence. Here, to further test the mutational explanation and the LFENM, we analyze the structural differences observed not only in homologous (globin-like) proteins but also in unselected experimentally engineered myoglobin mutants and in wild-type variants subject to other perturbations such as ligand-binding and pH changes. We show that the lowest normal modes dominate structural change in all the cases considered and that the LFENM reproduces this behavior quantitatively. The collective nature of the lowest normal modes results in global conformational changes that depend little on the exact nature or location of the perturbation. Significantly, the evolutionarily conserved structural core matches the regions observed to be more robust with respect to mutations, so that the core would be more conserved even under unselected random mutations. In a word, the observed patterns of structural variation can be seen as the natural response of proteins to perturbations and can be adequately modeled using the LFENM, which serves as a common framework to relate a priori different phenomena. labels: #Globins'
b'S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), a mutagenic and nephrotoxic metabolite of trichloroethylene, is bioactivated to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine sulfoxide (DCVCS) and chlorothioketene and/or 2-chlorothionoacetyl chloride by cysteine conjugate S-oxidase (S-oxidase) and cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (beta-lyase), respectively. Previously, we identified DCVCS-globin monoadducts and cross-links upon treating rats with DCVCS or incubating erythrocytes with DCVCS. In this study, the formation of DCVC-derived reactive intermediates was investigated after rats were given a single (230 or 460 micromol/kg, i.p.) or multiple (3 or 30 micromol/kg daily for 5 days) DCVC doses. LC/ESI/MS of trypsin-digested globin peptides revealed both S-oxidase and beta-lyase-derived globin monoadducts and cross-links consistent with in vivo DCVC bioactivation by both pathways. MS/MS analyses of trypsin-digested fractions of globin from one of the rats treated with multiple 30 micromol/kg DCVC doses led to identification of beta-lyase-derived monoadducts on both Cys93 and Cys125 of the beta-chains. While rats dosed with the 230 micromol/kg DCVC dose exhibited beta-lyase-dependent monoadducts and cross-links only (four out of four rats), rats given the 460 micromol/kg DCVC dose (two out of four) and rats administered the multiple DCVC doses (two out of four) exhibited both beta-lyase- and S-oxidase-derived monoadducts and cross-links. Because previous incubations of erythrocytes with DCVC did not result in detection of DCVCS-derived monoadducts or cross-links and had only resulted in detection of beta-lyase-derived monoadducts and cross-links, the DCVCS-globin monoadducts and cross-links detected in this study are likely the result of DCVC bioactivation outside the circulation and subsequent translocation of DCVCS and N-acetylated DCVCS into the erythrocytes. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a recently discovered member of the globin family, mainly observed in neurons and retina. Despite the low sequence identity (less than 20% over the whole sequence for the human proteins), the general fold of neuroglobin closely resembles that of myoglobin. The latter is a paradigmatic protein for folding studies, whereas much less is known about the neuroglobin folding pathway. In this work, we show how the structural features of helix F in neuroglobin and myoglobin could represent a pivotal difference in their folding pathways. Former studies widely documented that myoglobin lacks helix F in the apo form. In this study, limited proteolysis experiments on aponeuroglobin showed that helix F does not undergo proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that, also in the apo form, this helix maintains a rigid and structured conformation. To understand better the structural properties of helices F in the two proteins, we analyzed peptides encompassing helix F of neuroglobin and myoglobin in the wild-type and mutant forms. NMR and CD experiments revealed a helical conformation for neuroglobin helix F peptide, at both pH 7 and pH 2, absent in the myoglobin peptide. In particular, NMR data suggest a secondary structure stabilization effect caused by hydrophobic interactions involving Tyr88, Leu89 and Leu92. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on the apo and holo forms of the two proteins reveal the persistence of helix F in neuroglobin even in the absence of heme. Conversely myoglobin shows a higher mobility of the N-terminus of helix F on heme removal, which leads to the loss of secondary structure. labels: #Globins'
b'The contribution of changes in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting factors to interspecies differences in gene expression is not well understood. The mammalian beta-globin loci have served as a model for gene regulation during development. Transgenic mice containing the human beta-globin locus, consisting of the linked embryonic (epsilon), fetal (gamma) and adult (beta) genes, have been used as a system to investigate the temporal switch from fetal to adult haemoglobin, as occurs in humans. Here we show that the human gamma-globin (HBG) genes in these mice behave as murine embryonic globin genes, revealing a limitation of the model and demonstrating that critical differences in the trans-acting milieu have arisen during mammalian evolution. We show that the expression of BCL11A, a repressor of human gamma-globin expression identified by genome-wide association studies, differs between mouse and human. Developmental silencing of the mouse embryonic globin and human gamma-globin genes fails to occur in mice in the absence of BCL11A. Thus, BCL11A is a critical mediator of species-divergent globin switching. By comparing the ontogeny of beta-globin gene regulation in mice and humans, we have shown that alterations in the expression of a trans-acting factor constitute a critical driver of gene expression changes during evolution. labels: #Globins'
b'The exposure of the skin to Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a stressful event and the skin has multiple innate defense mechanisms to counter this threat. For instance, oxidatively damaged nerve cells will express neuroglobin, a hexa-coordinate heme protein, to scavenge free radicals such as nitric oxide (NO). Likewise, keratinocytes will express various anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), which will defend the cells against oxidative threats. Nonetheless, cells will still express free radicals during excessive irradiation. A fundamental question that needs to be asked is: what do these cells communicate to one another during such stressful events? This paper will present results of an in vitro study in which dorsal root ganglion were irradiated with UV radiation to elicit oxidative events such as release of NO and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent neuropeptide. Cell survival was also examined using the standard MTT assay. A plant-based neuroglobin mimic called phytoglobin was used as an NO scavenger to see if control of NO would influence CGRP expression and cell survival. Results of this study demonstrate that control of NO expression in irradiated nerve cells can influence CGRP expression and can also increase cell survival rates. Following this preliminary study, controlled amounts of the nerve cell growth media were added to cultures of normal human keratinocytes and the keratinocytes were allowed to interact with the nerve cell media for 24 h. Following this treatment period, human microarrays were run on the keratinocytes to see what genes were influenced in the keratinocytes as a result of contact with the irradiated nerve cell growth media. It was found that several critical genes expressed by the keratinocytes including NO synthase (NOS1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), transglutaminase 1 and 3 (TGM1 and TGM3), metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), and filaggrin (FLG) were clearly influenced by the damaged nerve cells. labels: #Globins'
b'The alpha-MRE is the major regulatory element responsible for the expression of human alpha-like globin genes. It is genetically polymorphic, and six different haplotypes, named A to F, have been identified in some population groups from Europe, Africa and Asia and in native Indians from two Brazilian Indian tribes. Most of the mutations that constitute the alpha-MRE haplotypes are located in flanking sequences of binding sites for nuclear factors. To our knowledge, there are no experimental studies evaluating whether such variability may influence the alpha-MRE enhancer activity. We analyzed and compared the expression of luciferase of nine constructs containing different alpha-MRE elements as enhancers. Genomic DNA samples from controls with A (wild-type alpha-MRE) and B haplotypes were used to generate C-F haplotypes by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, three other elements containing only the G-->A polymorphism at positions +130, +199, and +209, separately, were also tested. The different alpha-MRE elements were amplified and cloned into a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene and the SV40 promoter and used to transiently transfect K562 cells. A noticeable reduction in luciferase expression was observed with all constructs compared with the A haplotype. The greatest reductions occurred with the F haplotype (+96, C-->A) and the isolated polymorphism +209, both located near the SP1 protein-binding sites believed not to be active in vivo. These are the first analyses of alpha-MRE polymorphisms on gene expression and demonstrate that these single nucleotide polymorphisms, although outside the binding sites for nuclear factors, are able to influence in vitro gene expression. labels: #Globins'
b'Global transcriptome analysis of whole blood RNA using microarrays has been proven to be challenging due to the high abundance of globin transcripts that constitute 70% of whole blood mRNA. This is a particular problem in patients with sickle cell disease, secondary to the high abundance of globin-expressing nucleated red blood cells and reticulocytes in the circulation. In order to accurately measure the steady state blood transcriptome in sickle cell patients we evaluated the efficacy of reducing globin transcripts in PAXgene stabilized RNA for genome-wide transcriptome analyses using microarrays. We demonstrate here by both microarrays and Q-PCR that the globin mRNA depletion method resulted in 55-65 fold reduction in globin transcripts in whole blood collected from healthy volunteers and sickle cell disease patients. This led to an improvement in microarray data quality by reducing data variability, with increased detection rate of expressed genes and improved overlap with the expression signatures of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) preparations. Analysis of differences between the whole blood transcriptome and PBMC transcriptome revealed important erythrocyte genes that participate in sickle cell pathogenesis and compensation. The combination of globin mRNA reduction after whole-blood RNA stabilization represents a robust clinical research methodology for the discovery of biomarkers for hematologic diseases. labels: #Globins'
b'A binding site for iron protoporphyrin IX (heme) was designed and embedded in a photosynthetic non-heme protein, phycocyanin, which forms a globin-like backbone structure, called a globin fold, but lacks sequence similarity to the globin family containing myoglobins and hemoglobins. Based on the structural alignment of the phycocyanin and myoglobin molecules, the proximal and distal His residues were repositioned in the phycocyanin sequence for heme ligation. The heme-binding pocket was created around the His residues by several residue replacements in the phycocyanin core. The synthesized phycocyanin variant, designated as HPY, bound one heme per protein molecule and showed spectroscopic features characteristic of six-coordinated heme proteins. The heme-binding HPY exhibited redox activity with an electrochemical midpoint potential of -130 mV against the standard hydrogen electrode, which was approximately 200 mV lower than the potential of natural myoglobins but 50 mV higher than the typical values of designed heme proteins with four-helix bundle or globin scaffolds. HPY also displayed native-like folding properties, in contrast to these designed heme proteins. However, the bound ferrous heme of HPY was quickly reoxidized by air and did not stably bind O(2), unlike the natural globins. The present results demonstrated that the globin fold of a non-globin protein is suitable for binding heme but is not sufficient for the reversible O(2) binding and myoglobin functions. The comparison of HPY with the natural globins may yield new insights into the essential features for realizing the natural heme protein functions. labels: #Globins'
b'Deep diving mammals have developed strategies to cope with limited oxygen availability when submerged. These adaptations are associated with an increased neuronal hypoxia tolerance. Brain neurons of the hooded seal Cystophora cristata remain much longer active in hypoxic conditions than those of mice. To understand the cellular basis of neuronal hypoxia tolerance, we studied neuroglobin and cytochrome c in C. cristata brain. Neuroglobin, a respiratory protein typically found in vertebrate neurons, displays three unique amino acid substitutions in hooded seal. However, these substitutions unlikely contribute to a modulation of O(2) affinity. Moreover, there is no significant difference in total neuroglobin protein levels in mouse, rat and seal brains. However, in terrestrial mammals neuroglobin resided exclusively in neurons, whereas in seals neuroglobin is mainly located in astrocytes. This unusual localization of neuroglobin is accompanied by a shift in the distribution of cytochrome c. In seals, this marker for oxidative metabolism is mainly localized in astrocytes, whereas in terrestrial mammals it is essentially found in neurons. Our results indicate that in seals aerobic ATP production depends significantly on astrocytes, while neurons rely less on aerobic energy metabolism. This adaptation may imbue seal neurons with an increased tolerance to hypoxia and potentially also to reactive oxygen species, and may explain in part the ability of deep diving mammals to sustain neuronal activity during prolonged dives. labels: #Globins'
b'AIM: To explore the protective role and mechanism of endogenous neuroglobin (Ngb) in neuronal cells under oxidative stress.METHODS: A stable N2a neuroblastoma cell line expressing the Ngb-siRNA plasmid (N2a/Ngb-siRNA) was established by neomycin screening. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect Ngb gene and protein levels. Hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress in N2a cells. Cytotoxicity and cell viability were measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and WST-8 assays. Apoptotic cells were detected by Hoechst staining.RESULTS: Cotransfection of Ngb-siRNA with Ngb-GFP plasmids suppressed the expression of Ngb-GFP in N2a cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that the expression of endogenous Ngb was successfully knocked down to about 20% in N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells compared with control cells. A WST-8 assay demonstrated that viability was significantly decreased in N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells and N2a cells transiently transfected with Ngb-siRNA plasmids compared with controls following hydrogen peroxide treatment. An LDH assay demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the death of Ngb-siRNA-transfected N2a cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment. Hoechst staining demonstrated that the quantity of apoptotic cells among N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment significantly increased compared with controls. In N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells, the expression level of activated caspase-3 significantly increased, whereas the expression of 14-3-3gamma decreased compared with that of N2a/vec cells. Transfection of 14-3-3gamma plasmids significantly enhanced the viability of N2a/Ngb-siRNA cells following hydrogen peroxide treatment compared with vector controls.CONCLUSION: Ngb contributes to neuronal defensive machinery against oxidative injuries by regulating 14-3-3gamma expression.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 913-918; doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.70. labels: #Globins'
b'We still know very little about how proteins achieve their native three-dimensional structure in vitro and in the cell. Folding studies as proteins emerge from the mega Dalton-sized ribosome pose special challenges due to the large size and complicated nature of the ribosome-nascent chain complex. This work introduces a combination of three-component analysis of fluorescence depolarization decays (including the presence of two local motions) and in-cone analysis of diffusive local dynamics to investigate the spatial constraints experienced by a protein emerging from the ribosomal tunnel. We focus on E. coli ribosomes and an all-alpha-helical nascent globin in the presence and absence of the cotranslationally active chaperones DnaK and trigger factor. The data provide insights on the dynamic nature and structural plasticity of ribosome-nascent chain complexes. We find that the sub-ns motions of the N-terminal fluorophore, reporting on the globin dynamics in the vicinity of the N terminus, are highly constrained both inside and outside the ribosomal tunnel, resulting in high-order parameters (>0.85) and small cone semiangles (<30 degrees ). The shorter globin chains buried inside the tunnel are less spatially constrained than those of a reference sequence from a natively unfolded protein, suggesting either that the two nascent chain sequences have a different secondary structure and therefore sample different regions of the tunnel or that the tunnel undergoes local structural adjustments to accommodate the globin sequence. Longer globins emerging out of the ribosomal tunnel are also found to have highly spatially constrained slow (ns) motions. There are no observable spectroscopic changes in the absence of bound chaperones. labels: #Globins'
b"BACKGROUND: Cytoglobin (Cygb) was first described in 2002 as an intracellular globin of unknown function. We have previously shown the downregulation of cytoglobin as a key event in a familial cancer syndrome of the upper aerodigestive tract.METHODS: Cytoglobin expression and promoter methylation were investigated in sporadic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using a cross-section of clinical samples. Additionally, the putative mechanisms of Cygb expression in cancer were explored by subjecting HNSCC cell lines to hypoxic culture conditions and 5-aza-2-deoxycitidine treatment.RESULTS: In clinically derived HNSCC samples, CYGB mRNA expression showed a striking correlation with tumour hypoxia (measured by HIF1A mRNA expression P=0.013) and consistent associations with histopathological measures of tumour aggression. CYGB expression also showed a marked negative correlation with promoter methylation (P=0.018). In the HNSCC cell lines cultured under hypoxic conditions, a trend of increasing expression of both CYGB and HIF1A with progressive hypoxia was observed. Treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycitidine dramatically increased CYGB expression in those cell lines with greater baseline promoter methylation.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the CYGB gene is regulated by both promoter methylation and tumour hypoxia in HNSCC and that increased expression of this gene correlates with clincopathological measures of a tumour's biological aggression. labels: #Globins"
b'Although distal regulatory regions are frequent throughout the genome, the molecular mechanisms by which they act in a promoter-specific manner remain to be elucidated. The human beta-globin locus constitutes an extremely well-established multigenic model to investigate this issue. In erythroid cells, the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) exerts distal regulatory function by influencing local chromatin organization and inducing high-level expression of individual beta-like globin genes. Moreover, in transgenic mice expressing the entire human beta-globin locus, deletion of LCR-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) can alter beta-like globin gene expression. Here, we show that abnormal expression of human beta-like globin genes in the absence of HS2 is associated with decreased efficacy of pre-initiation complex formation at the human epsilon- and gamma-promoters, but not at the beta-promoter. This promoter-specific phenomenon is associated with reduced long-range interactions between the HS2-deleted LCR and human gamma-promoters. We also find that HS2 is dispensable for high-level human beta-gene transcription, whereas deletion of this hypersensitive site can alter locus chromatin organization; therefore the functions exerted by HS2 in transcriptional enhancement and locus chromatin organization are distinct. Overall, our data delineate one mechanism whereby a distal regulatory region provides promoter-specific transcriptional enhancement. labels: #Globins'
b'In Albania, no definite national screening programme of beta-thalassaemia has yet been developed for carrier detection. Only limited information about the occurrence and the types of haemoglobin abnormalities is available. Thus, an educational and screening programme was carried out in one high school with a total of 217 young students from the coastal province of Lushnja in Albania. The pilot programme included a systematic sampling of whole saliva, DNA genomic extraction and the determination of defective beta-thalassaemia genes by reverse dot-blot hybridization with 22 probes specific for the Mediterranean populations.Of the 201 subjects tested, 17 (8.4%) students turned out to be carriers of beta-thalassaemia mutations and haemoglobin variants. The most common mutation is HbS (c.20A-->T) with a frequency of 3.2%, followed by IVS-I-110 (G-->A) (c.93-21G-->A) substitution identified in 4 out of 402 chromosomes (1%). In the province of Lushnja, the frequency of beta-thalassaemia carriers was high. As expected, the results show that identified mutations in this population are similar to those found in the east Mediterranean area, suggesting the same origin for mutant alleles during migratory streams. Implementation of a routine carrier-screening programme is significantly facilitated by the presence of only two mutations and would be a wise approach to prevent beta-thalassaemia in the region. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a member of the vertebrate globin family expressed particularly in the brain and in the retina. Ngb is concentrated in the mitochondria-containing areas of neurons, and its distribution is correlated with oxygen consumption rates. Previously we have shown that Ngb is expressed in carotid body (CB) tissues. Considering that hypoxia and aging may be linked through a series of adaptive and protective mechanisms (e.g. reduction in mitochondrial numbers), we investigate the role of Ngb during aging and hypoxia. Two groups of six rats (age-matched 3 and 24 months old) were kept in room air as a control groups, the others two groups were kept in a Plexiglas chamber for 12 days in chronic hypoxia (10-12% inspired oxygen). The presence of Ngb in the CB tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody. Ngb immunoreactivity was significantly higher in CB tissues from young rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia, whereas CB tissues from old rats did not show any significant increase in Ngb levels after hypoxia. Similar to hemoglobin, Ngb may act as a respiratory protein by reversibly binding gaseous ligands NO and O(2) and could act as a NO scavenger and participate in detoxification of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generated under hypoxic conditions. labels: #Globins'
b'Differentiation of erythroid cells is regulated by cell signaling pathways including those that change the intracellular concentration of calcium. Calcium-dependent proteases have been shown previously to process and regulate the activity of specific transcription factors. We show here that the protein levels of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) increase during differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. USF was subject to degradation by the Ca(2+)-dependent protease m-calpain in undifferentiated but not in differentiated MEL cells. Treatment of MEL cells with the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin increased the levels of USF and strongly induced expression of the adult alpha- and beta-globin genes. The induction of globin gene expression was associated with an increase in the association of USF and RNA po ly mer ase II with regulatory elements of the beta-globin gene locus. Calpeptin also induced high level alpha- and beta-globin gene expression in primary CD71-positive erythroid progenitor cells. The combined data suggest that inhibition of calpain activity is required for erythroid differentiation-associated increase in globin gene expression. labels: #Globins'

b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is an oxygen binding heme protein found in nervous tissue with a yet unclear physiological and protective role in the hypoxia-sensitive mammalian brain. Here we utilized in vivo and in vitro studies to examine the role of Ngb in anoxic and post-anoxic neuronal survival in the freshwater turtle. We employed semiquantitative RT-PCR and western blotting to analyze Ngb mRNA and protein levels in turtle brain and neuronally enriched cultures. Ngb expression is strongly up-regulated by hypoxia and post-anoxia reoxygenation but increases only modestly in anoxia. The potential neuroprotective role of Ngb in this species was analyzed by knocking down Ngb using specific small interfering RNA. Ngb knockdown in neuronally enriched cell cultures resulted in significant increases in H(2)O(2) release compared to controls but no change in cell death. Cell survival may be linked to activation of other protective responses such as the extracellular regulated kinase transduction pathway, as phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase levels in anoxia were significantly higher in Ngb knockdown cultures compared to controls. The greater expression of Ngb when reactive oxygen species are likely to be high, and the increased susceptibility of neurons to H(2)O(2) release and external oxidative stress in knockdown cultures, suggests a role for Ngb in reducing reactive oxygen species production or in detoxification, though it does not appear to be of primary importance in the anoxia tolerant turtle in the presence of compensatory survival mechanisms. labels: #Globins'
b"This work reports for the first time the expression of a soluble B2 globin chain that is part of the extracellular hexagonal-bilayer haemoglobin from Arenicola marina. Two recombinant B2 globins were produced, one fused with gluthatione S-tranferase (B2-GST) and the other without a fusion tag (RecB2) and requiring a different purification procedure. We also describe a new method for the expression of globin that uses Studier's auto-induction medium together with the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid. Media supplementation with the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid in the culture increased heme synthesis by E. coli leading to the expression of the recombinant B2 globins in their active form. RecB2 and B2-GST were expressed with a yield of up to 105 mg/l of E. coli culture. Our approach is rapid and requires only one chromatographic purification step for B2-GST and three purification steps for RecB2. The overall results on RecB2 and B2-GST show that the recombinant globins exhibit similar properties to those of Arenicola marina native HBL-Hb with a great stability and a strong oxygen binding. The results and methodologies described in this paper are the beginning of a work aiming at reconstituting a recombinant HBL-Hb by genetic engineering in order to produce an innovative oxygen carrier for therapeutic applications. labels: #Globins"
b'Several pH-dependent low-spin ferric haem forms are identified in a frozen solution of the ferric \xc2\xb9\xc2\xb2\xc2\xb9Cys\xe2\x86\x92Ser mutant of Drosophila melanogaster haemoglobin (DmHb1*) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Different forms with EPR parameters typical of bis-histidine coordinated haem iron centers were observed. Strong pH-dependent changes in the EPR signatures were observed related to changes in the haem pocket. The pulsed EPR data indicate that both the distal and proximal histidine exhibit a large libration around the Fe-N(His) axis. The resonance Raman spectra of the CO-ligated ferrous form of Drosophila melanogaster haemoglobin are typical of an open conformation, with little stabilization of the CO ligand by the surrounding amino-acid residues. The EPR data of the cyanide-ligated ferric DmHb1* indicates a close similarity with cyanide-ligated ferric myoglobin. The structural characteristics of DmHb1* are found to clearly differ from those of other bis-histidine-coordinated globins. labels: #Globins'
b'For a long time, haemoglobin and myoglobin had been assumed to represent the only globin types of vertebrates. In 2000, however, we discovered a third globin type by mining the genome sequence data. Based on a preferential expression in the nervous system, this globin is referred to as neuroglobin. Despite nine years of research, its function is still uncertain and a number of hypotheses have been put forward. Neuroglobin enhances cell viability under hypoxia and under various types of oxidative stress in transgenic systems, but does not appear to be strongly upregulated in response to stress. A close phylogenetic relationship with invertebrate nerve globins and its positive correlation with the oxidative metabolism and mitochondria suggest a role in O(2) supply. In vitro studies and cell culture experiments imply that neuroglobin may detoxify reactive oxygen or nitric oxide. Still other studies propose neuroglobin as being part of a signalling chain that transmits the redox state of the cell or that inhibits apoptosis. Although some functions are more probable than others, we conclude that it is still too early to definitively decide what may be the physiological role(s) of neuroglobin in vertebrates. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that neuroglobin has an essential, conserved function and is beneficial to neurons. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a tissue globin specifically expressed in neurons. Our laboratory and others have shown that Ngb overexpression protects neurons against hypoxia/ischemia, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia/ischemia induces a multitude of spatially and temporally regulated responses in gene expression, and initial evidence suggested that Ngb might function in altering biological processes of gene expression. In this study, we asked how Ngb may help regulate genes responsive to hypoxia. Expression of hypoxic response genes following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was examined using mRNA arrays in neuroglobin-overexpressing transgenic (Ngb-Tg) and wild type (WT) mouse neurons. From a total of 113 genes on the microarray, mRNA expression of 65 genes was detected. Under rest condition, 14 genes were downregulated in Ngb-Tg neurons compared to WT. In WT neurons, after 4-h OGD followed by 4-h reoxygenation (O4/R4), 20 genes were significantly downregulated, and only Fos mRNA was significantly increased. However, out of the 20 downregulated genes in WT neurons, 12 of them were no longer significantly changed in Ngb-Tg neurons: Add1, Arnt2, Camk2g, Cstb, Dr1, Epas1, Gna11, Hif1a, Il6st, Khsrp, Mars and Rara. Among these 12 genes, 8 (Add1, Camk2g, Cstb, Dr1, Epas1, Gna11, Hif1a, Khsrp) were already reduced in Ngb-Tg neurons compared to WT under rest conditions. Additionally, three genes that initially showed no changes in WT neurons (Ctgf, Egfr and Pea15) were downregulated after OGD in the Ngb-Tg neurons. These findings suggest that Ngb overexpression modulates mRNA expression of multiple hypoxic response genes in the early phase after OGD/reoxygenation. Further studies on these gene networks and interactions may lead to better understanding of Ngb in signaling pathways that contribute to neuroprotection. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin is a recently identified globin molecule that is expressed predominantly in the vertebrate brain. Neuroglobin expression increases in oxygen-deprived neurons, suggesting it protects neurons from ischemic cell death. We report that neuroglobin transcript and protein are expressed in human glioblastoma cells, and that this expression increases in hypoxia in vitro. We also show that neuroglobin is up-regulated in hypoxic microregions of glioblastoma tumor xenografts. Our finding of hypoxic up-regulation of neuroglobin in human glioblastoma cells may provide insight into how tumor cells adapt to and survive in hypoxic microenvironments. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: Although microarray technology has become the most common method for studying global gene expression, a plethora of technical factors across the experiment contribute to the variable of genome gene expression profiling using peripheral whole blood. A practical platform needs to be established in order to obtain reliable and reproducible data to meet clinical requirements for biomarker study.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We applied peripheral whole blood samples with globin reduction and performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis using Illumina BeadChips. Real-time PCR was subsequently used to evaluate the quality of array data and elucidate the mode in which hemoglobin interferes in gene expression profiling. We demonstrated that, when applied in the context of standard microarray processing procedures, globin reduction results in a consistent and significant increase in the quality of beadarray data. When compared to their pre-globin reduction counterparts, post-globin reduction samples show improved detection statistics, lowered variance and increased sensitivity. More importantly, gender gene separation is remarkably clearer in post-globin reduction samples than in pre-globin reduction samples. Our study suggests that the poor data obtained from pre-globin reduction samples is the result of the high concentration of hemoglobin derived from red blood cells either interfering with target mRNA binding or giving the pseudo binding background signal.CONCLUSION: We therefore recommend the combination of performing globin mRNA reduction in peripheral whole blood samples and hybridizing on Illumina BeadChips as the practical approach for biomarker study. labels: #Globins'
b'Nitrosyl hydride, HNO or nitroxyl, is the one-electron reduced and protonated form of nitric oxide. HNO is isoelectronic to singlet O(2), and we have previously reported that deoxymyoglobin traps free HNO to form a stable adduct. In this report, we demonstrate that oxygen-binding hemoglobins from human, soy, and clam also trap HNO to form adducts which are stable over a period of weeks. The same species can be formed in higher yields by careful reduction of the ferrous nitrosyl adducts of the proteins. Like the analogous O(2)-Fe(II) adducts, the HNO adducts are diamagnetic, but with a characteristic HNO resonance in (1)H NMR at ca. 15 ppm that splits into doublets for H(15)NO adducts. The (1)H and (15)N NMR resonances, obtained by HSQC experiments, are shown to differentiate subunits and isoforms of proteins within mixtures. An apparent difference in the reduction rates of the NO adducts of the two subunits of human hemoglobin allows assignment of two distinct nitrosyl hydride peaks by a combination of UV-vis, NMR, and EPR analysis. The two peaks of the HNO-hHb adduct have a persistent 3:1 ratio during trapping reactions, demonstrating a kinetic difference between HNO binding at the two subunits. These results show NMR characterization of ferrous HNO adducts as a unique tool sensitive to structural changes within the oxygen-binding cavity, which may be of use in defining modes of oxygen binding in other heme proteins and enzymes. labels: #Globins'
b'Our aim is to shed light on the conservation of potential ligand docking sites that play an important role in ligand dynamics of globins by using the technique of filling internal cavities naturally present in hemoglobin and myoglobin with xenon atoms. In particular, we present the high resolution structures of the Xe-adduct of deoxygenated wild type human hemoglobin and a quadruple mutant (L(B10)Y and H(E7)Q in alpha and beta chains). For the sake of comparison we also determined under the same experimental conditions the xenon complex of wild type sperm whale myoglobin. The analysis revealed that the number and position of Xe binding cavities are different in the alpha and beta subunits, the latter being more similar to myoglobin. Notably, no proximal Xe docking site was detected in hemoglobin, at variance with myoglobin. The pattern of internal cavities accessibility and affinity for xenon suggests a different role for the dynamics of ligand migration in the two types of hemoglobin chains as compared to myoglobin. The number and position of hydrophobic cavities in hemoglobin are briefly discussed also in comparison with the data available for other members of the globin superfamily. labels: #Globins'
b'Neuroglobin (Ngb) and the cellular prion protein (PrP(c)), proteins of unknown function in the nervous system, are known to be expressed in the retina and have been observed in different rat retinal cells. The retina is the site of the highest concentration for Ngb, a heme protein of similar size and conformation to myoglobin. In this study, we demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis of retinal colocalization of Ngb and PrP(c) in the ganglion cell layer. Considering for these two a common protective role in relation to oxidative stress and a possible transient contact during migration of PrP(c) through the eye or upon neuronal degradation, we undertook in vitro studies of the interaction of the purified proteins. Mixing these two proteins leads to rapid aggregation, even at submicromolar concentrations. As observed with the use of dynamic light scattering, particles comprising both proteins evolve to hundreds of nanometers within several seconds, a first report showing that PrP(c) is able to form aggregates without major structural changes. The main effect would then appear to be a protein-protein interaction specific to the surface charge of the Ngb protein with PrP(c) N-terminal sequence. A dominant parameter is the solvent ionic force, which can significantly modify the final state of aggregation. PrP(c), normally anchored to the cell membrane, is toxic in the cytoplasm, where Ngb is present; this could suggest an Ngb function of scavenging proteins capable of forming deleterious aggregates considering a charge complementarity in the complex. labels: #Globins'
b'This work aims at investigating the neuroprotective effects of neuroglobin (Ngb) in vivo and in vitro. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to examine Ngb mRNA and protein levels in the mouse cortex after acute and repeated exposure to hypoxia. The cDNAs of mouse Ngb were cloned and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells to examine Ngb function in vitro. Expression of Ngb and mRNA was upregulated in the cortex of mice preconditioned by repetitive exposure to hypoxia. Tolerance to hypoxia of Ngb-transformed SH-SY5Y cells was enhanced. These results suggest that Ngb might be involved in hypoxic preconditioning which protects neurons from hypoxic injury. labels: #Globins'
b'The purification, crystallization and successful structure determination by molecular replacement of wild-type human brain neuroglobin at 1.8 A resolution is reported. The apparent space group was orthorhombic C222(1), but the real space group was monoclinic P2(1), which resulted from twinning. Indeed, the unit-cell parameters, a = 31.2, b = 139.1, c = 31.2 A, beta = 102 degrees , display a fortuitously close to c and twinning by the operator l, -k, h occurs. Twinning was not evident from the initial analysis of intensity distribution, but pseudo-merohedral twinning was revealed by the Padilla and Yeates test based on local intensity differences. A twinning fraction of 0.5 was determined in SHELXL, indicating a perfect hemihedrally twinned crystal. To date, this type of twinning has been reported in more than ten structures, which makes it quite a common case in proteins. labels: #Globins'
b'The principles of natural protein engineering are obscured by overlapping functions and complexity accumulated through natural selection and evolution. Completely artificial proteins offer a clean slate on which to define and test these protein engineering principles, while recreating and extending natural functions. Here we introduce this method with the design of an oxygen transport protein, akin to human neuroglobin. Beginning with a simple and unnatural helix-forming sequence with just three different amino acids, we assembled a four-helix bundle, positioned histidines to bis-histidine ligate haems, and exploited helical rotation and glutamate burial on haem binding to introduce distal histidine strain and facilitate O(2) binding. For stable oxygen binding without haem oxidation, water is excluded by simple packing of the protein interior and loops that reduce helical-interface mobility. O(2) affinities and exchange timescales match natural globins with distal histidines, with the remarkable exception that O(2) binds tighter than CO. labels: #Globins'
b"Globin-coupled sensors are heme-binding signal transducers in Bacteria and Archaea in which an N-terminal globin controls the activity of a variable C-terminal domain. Here, we report that BpeGReg, a globin-coupled diguanylate cyclase from the whooping cough pathogen Bordetella pertussis, synthesizes the second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) upon oxygen binding. Expression of BpeGReg in Salmonella typhimurium enhances biofilm formation, while knockout of the BpeGReg gene of B. pertussis results in decreased biofilm formation. These results represent the first identification a signal ligand for any diguanylate cyclase and provide definitive experimental evidence that a globin-coupled sensor regulates c-di-GMP synthesis and biofilm formation. We propose that the synthesis of c-di-GMP by globin sensors is a widespread phenomenon in bacteria. labels: #Globins"
b'Behaviours evolve by iterations of natural selection, but we have few insights into the molecular and neural mechanisms involved. Here we show that some Caenorhabditis elegans wild strains switch between two foraging behaviours in response to subtle changes in ambient oxygen. This finely tuned switch is conferred by a naturally variable hexacoordinated globin, GLB-5. GLB-5 acts with the atypical soluble guanylate cyclases, which are a different type of oxygen binding protein, to tune the dynamic range of oxygen-sensing neurons close to atmospheric (21%) concentrations. Calcium imaging indicates that one group of these neurons is activated when oxygen rises towards 21%, and is inhibited as oxygen drops below 21%. The soluble guanylate cyclase GCY-35 is required for high oxygen to activate the neurons; GLB-5 provides inhibitory input when oxygen decreases below 21%. Together, these oxygen binding proteins tune neuronal and behavioural responses to a narrow oxygen concentration range close to atmospheric levels. The effect of the glb-5 gene on oxygen sensing and foraging is modified by the naturally variable neuropeptide receptor npr-1 (refs 4, 5), providing insights into how polygenic variation reshapes neural circuit function. labels: #Globins'
b'BACKGROUND: A great deal is known about the qualitative aspects of the sequence-structure relationship, for example that buried residues are usually more conserved between structurally similar homologues, but no attempts have been made to quantitate the relationship between evolutionary conservation at a sequence position and change to global tertiary structure. In this paper we demonstrate that the Spearman correlation between sequence and structural change is suitable for this purpose.RESULTS: Buried residues, bends, cysteines, prolines and leucines were significantly more likely to occupy positions highly correlated with structural change than expected by chance. Some buried residues were found to be less informative than expected, particularly residues involved in active sites and the binding of small molecules.CONCLUSION: The correlation-based method generates predictions of structural importance for superfamily positions which agree well with previous results of manual analyses, and may be of use in automated residue annotation piplines. A PERL script which implements the method is provided. labels: #Globins'
b'A preclinical humanized mouse model of beta thalassemia major or Cooley anemia (CA) was generated by targeted gene replacement of the mouse adult globin genes in embryonic stem cells. The mouse adult alpha and beta globin genes were replaced with adult human alpha globin genes (alpha2alpha1) and a human fetal to adult hemoglobin (Hb)-switching cassette (gamma(HPFH)deltabeta(0)), respectively. Similar to human infants with CA, fully humanized mice survived postnatally by synthesizing predominantly human fetal Hb, HbF (alpha(2)gamma(2)), with a small amount of human minor adult Hb, HbA2 (alpha(2)delta(2)). Completion of the human fetal to adult Hb switch after birth resulted in severe anemia marked by erythroid hyperplasia, ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and death. Similar to human patients, CA mice were rescued from lethal anemia by regular blood transfusion. Transfusion corrected the anemia and effectively suppressed the ineffective erythropoiesis, but led to iron overload. This preclinical humanized animal model of CA will be useful for the development of new transfusion and iron chelation regimens, the study of iron homeostasis in disease, and testing of cellular and genetic therapies for the correction of thalassemia. labels: #Globins'
b'The ubiquitously expressed nucleoside diphosphate kinases (Nm23/NDPK/Awd) are a large family of multifunctional enzymes implicated in nucleic acid metabolism and in normal and abnormal development. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of NDPK A- and B-deficient (Nme1(-/-)/Nme2(-/-)) mice in which>95% of the enzyme activity is eliminated. These mice are undersized, die perinatally, and exhibit a spectrum of hematological phenotypes including severe anemia, impaired maturation of erythrocytes, and abnormal hematopoiesis in the liver and bone marrow. Flow cytometric analysis of developing Nme1(-/-)/Nme2(-/-) erythroid cells indicated that the major iron transport receptor molecule TfR1 is attenuated concomitant with a reduction of intracellular iron, suggesting that TfR1 is a downstream target of NDPKs and that reduced iron in Nme1(-/-)/Nme2(-/-) erythroblasts is inhibiting their development. We conclude that Nm23/NDPKs play critical roles in definitive erythroid development. Our novel mouse model also links erythropoiesis and nucleotide metabolism. labels: #Globins'
b'Blood cells from three different sea turtle species were cultured for approximately 3 weeks in nutrient medium supplemented with recombinant human cytokines known to induce terminal maturation of human hematological stem cells. Cultured turtle erythrocytes were translucent, approximately 10x larger than human erythrocytes, contained a single fluorescent inclusion body, contained nuclear epsilon (embryonic) globin proteins, and, absent of organelles while fresh cells contained few, but well defined mitochondria. Cells with basophilic cytoplasm and in all stages of proliferation were observed in cytokine-supplemented cultures and appeared to possess active protein synthesis. Cultured thrombocytes aggregated in response to agonists for at least 8 days, post-collection, contained P-selectin in the nucleus of 6 day cultured cells which appeared to be released after activation with collagen, and after 6 days had no organelles or open canalicular-like system (OCS) while freshly isolated cells demonstrated few, if any organelles but had a well developed OCS. The response of turtle cells to apparently homologous but unnatural human cytokines and the sustained biological properties of thrombocytes identify this suspension culture system as a powerful tool to explore the evolution of cell types and molecular components of hematopoiesis and hemostasis. labels: #Globins'
b"Cardiac hypertrophy develops in response to a variety of cardiovascular stresses and results in activation of numerous signaling cascades and proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is a stress-responsive hemoprotein in the hypoxia-induced hypertrophic myocardium and it is transcriptionally regulated by calcineurin-dependent transcription factors. The cytoglobin transcript level is abundantly expressed in the adult heart and in response to hypoxia cytoglobin expression is markedly up-regulated within the hypoxia-induced hypertrophic heart. To define the molecular mechanism resulting in the induction of cytoglobin, we undertook a transcriptional analysis of the 5' upstream regulatory region of the cytoglobin gene. Evolutionarily conserved binding elements for transcription factors HIF-1, AP-1, and NFAT are located within the upstream region of the cytoglobin gene. Transcriptional assays demonstrated that calcineurin activity modulates cytoglobin transcription. Increased calcineurin activity enhances the ability of NFAT and AP-1 to bind to the putative cytoglobin promoter, especially under hypoxic conditions. In addition, inhibition of calcineurin, NFAT, and/or AP-1 activities decreases endogenous cytoglobin transcript and protein levels. Thus, the regulation of cytoglobin transcription by calcineurin-dependent transcription factors suggests that cytoglobin may have a functional role in calcium-dependent events accompanying cardiac remodeling. labels: #Globins"
b'OBJECTIVES: Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. We evaluated the efficacy of halofuginone, an inhibitor of collagen synthesis and myofibroblast activation, in preventing cerulein-induced pancreas fibrosis.METHODS: Collagen synthesis was evaluated by in situ hybridization and staining. Levels of prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta (P4Hbeta), cytoglobin/stellate cell activation-associated protein (Cygb/STAP), transgelin, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, serum response factor, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), Smad3, and pancreatitis-associated protein 1 (PAP-1) were determined by immunohistochemistry. Metalloproteinase activity was evaluated by zymography.RESULTS: Halofuginone prevented cerulein-dependent increase in collagen synthesis, collagen cross-linking enzyme P4Hbeta, Cygb/STAP, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 2. Halofuginone did not affect TGFbeta levels in cerulein-treated mice but inhibited serum response factor synthesis and Smad3 phosphorylation. In culture, halofuginone inhibited pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) proliferation and TGFbeta-dependent increase in Cygb/STAP and transgelin synthesis and metalloproteinase 2 activity. Halofuginone increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in PSCs derived from cerulein-treated mice. Halofuginone prevented the increase in acinar cell proliferation and further increased the cerulein-dependent PAP-1 synthesis.CONCLUSIONS: Halofuginone inhibits Smad3 phosphorylation and increases c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition of PSC activation and consequent prevention of fibrosis. Halofuginone increased the synthesis of PAP-1, which further reduces pancreas fibrosis. Thus, halofuginone might serve as a novel therapy for pancreas fibrosis. labels: #Globins'
b'The definitive diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia involves detection of a deletion of one or more alpha-globin that encode the alpha-chains of Hb (hemoglobin). To determine whether DNA analysis is indicated, screening tests such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and Hb typing are employed. alpha-Thalassemia often correlates with normal or low HbA2 values. Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is usually high in ferropenic anemia or lead-poisoning and is normal or slightly raised in beta-thalassemia. Therefore, ZPP is currently used as a marker to discriminate between ferropenic anemia and beta-thalassemia. We investigated the diagnostic potential of ZPP<150 micromol/mol heme in a screening strategy for alpha-thalassemia. We measured ZPP and performed DNA analysis for detecting the seven most prevalent alpha-thalassemia deletions, namely, alpha3.7, SEA, alpha20.5, alpha4.2, MED, FIL, and THAI, in the blood samples of 200 patients with MCV<70 fL and HbA2<or = 3.5%. Deletions were detected in 9% subjects in the ZPP>or = 150 group (n = 175) and 56% subjects in the ZPP<150 group (n = 29); this difference was statistically significant (chi-square test, P<0.001). We conclude that ZPP<150 micromol/mol heme can be used in a new screening strategy for alpha-thalassemia. labels: #Globins'
b'Oxidative stress is associated with the pathology of acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease. We have cloned a human neuroglobin (Nb) construct and over-expressed this protein in cultured human neuronal cells to assess whether Nb ameliorates the cellular response to experimental hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury. Parental cells transfected with a blank (pDEST40) vector responded to H/R injury with a significant decrease in cellular ATP at 5 and 24 h after insult. This was coupled with increases in the cytosolic Ca(2+), and the transition metals iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) within the cell body, as monitored simultaneously using X-ray fluorescence microprobe imaging. Parental cell viability decreased over the same time period with a approximately 4 to 5-fold increase in cell death (maximum approximately 25%) matched by an increase in caspase 3/7 activation (peaking at a 15-fold increase after 24 h) and condensation of beta-actin along axonal processes. Over-expression of Nb inhibited ATP loss and except for significant decreases in the sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), potassium (K) and Ca(2+) contents, maintained cellular ion homeostasis after H/R insult. This resulted in increased cell viability, significantly diminished caspase activation and maintenance of the beta-actin cytoskeletal structure and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These data indicate that bolstering the cellular content of Nb inhibits neuronal cell dysfunction promoted by H/R insult through multiple protective actions including: (i) maintenance of cellular bioenergetics; (ii) inhibition of Ca(2+) influx; (iii) a reduction in cellular uptake of Fe, Cu and Zn at the expense of S, Cl and K; and (iv) an enhancement of cell viability through inhibiting necrosis and apoptosis. labels: #Globins'
b'Klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant cause of nosocomial pneumonia and an alarming pathogen owing to the recent isolation of multidrug resistant strains. Understanding of immune responses orchestrating K. pneumoniae clearance by the host is of utmost importance. Here we show that type I interferon (IFN) signaling protects against lung infection with K. pneumoniae by launching bacterial growth-controlling interactions between alveolar macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. Type I IFNs are important but disparate and incompletely understood regulators of defense against bacterial infections. Type I IFN receptor 1 (Ifnar1)-deficient mice infected with K. pneumoniae failed to activate NK cell-derived IFN-\xce\xb3 production. IFN-\xce\xb3 was required for bactericidal action and the production of the NK cell response-amplifying IL-12 and CXCL10 by alveolar macrophages. Bacterial clearance and NK cell IFN-\xce\xb3 were rescued in Ifnar1-deficient hosts by Ifnar1-proficient NK cells. Consistently, type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells including alveolar macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils was dispensable for host defense and IFN-\xce\xb3 activation. The failure of Ifnar1-deficient hosts to initiate a defense-promoting crosstalk between alveolar macrophages and NK cell was circumvented by administration of exogenous IFN-\xce\xb3 which restored endogenous IFN-\xce\xb3 production and restricted bacterial growth. These data identify NK cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling as essential driver of K. pneumoniae clearance, and reveal specific targets for future therapeutic exploitations. labels: #Animals#Drug Resistance, Multiple#Interferon Type I#Killer Cells, Natural#Klebsiella Infections#Klebsiella pneumoniae#Macrophages, Alveolar#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mice, Knockout#Receptor Cross-Talk#Respiratory Tract Infections#Signal Transduction'
b"BACKGROUND: The Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study has developed predictive risk scores for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as confirmed estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \xe2\x89\xa4 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) events in HIV-positive people. We hypothesized that participants in D:A:D at high (>5%) predicted risk for both CVD and CKD would be at even greater risk for CVD and CKD events.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included all participants with complete risk factor (covariate) data, baseline eGFR>60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and a confirmed (>3 months apart) eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 thereafter to calculate CVD and CKD risk scores. We calculated CVD and CKD event rates by predicted 5-year CVD and CKD risk groups (\xe2\x89\xa41%,>1%-5%,>5%) and fitted Poisson models to assess whether CVD and CKD risk group effects were multiplicative. A total of 27,215 participants contributed 202,034 person-years of follow-up: 74% male, median (IQR) age 42 (36, 49) years, median (IQR) baseline year of follow-up 2005 (2004, 2008). D:A:D risk equations predicted 3,560 (13.1%) participants at high CVD risk, 4,996 (18.4%) participants at high CKD risk, and 1,585 (5.8%) participants at both high CKD and high CVD risk. CVD and CKD event rates by predicted risk group were multiplicative. Participants at high CVD risk had a 5.63-fold (95% CI 4.47, 7.09, p<0.001) increase in CKD events compared to those at low risk; participants at high CKD risk had a 1.31-fold (95% CI 1.09, 1.56, p = 0.005) increase in CVD events compared to those at low risk. Participants' CVD and CKD risk groups had multiplicative predictive effects, with no evidence of an interaction (p = 0.329 and p = 0.291 for CKD and CVD, respectively). The main study limitation is the difference in the ascertainment of the clinically defined CVD endpoints and the laboratory-defined CKD endpoints.CONCLUSIONS: We found that people at high predicted risk for both CVD and CKD have substantially greater risks for both CVD and CKD events compared with those at low predicted risk for both outcomes, and compared to those at high predicted risk for only CVD or CKD events. This suggests that CVD and CKD risk in HIV-positive persons should be assessed together. The results further encourage clinicians to prioritise addressing modifiable risks for CVD and CKD in HIV-positive people. labels: #Adult#Cardiovascular Diseases#Female#Glomerular Filtration Rate#HIV Seropositivity#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Predictive Value of Tests#Prospective Studies#Renal Insufficiency, Chronic#Risk Factors"
b'BACKGROUND: It is unknown if extremely early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may lead to long-term ART-free HIV remission or cure. As a result, we studied 2 individuals recruited from a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program who started prophylactic ART an estimated 10 days (Participant A; 54-year-old male) and 12 days (Participant B; 31-year-old male) after infection with peak plasma HIV RNA of 220 copies/mL and 3,343 copies/mL, respectively. Extensive testing of blood and tissue for HIV persistence was performed, and PrEP Participant A underwent analytical treatment interruption (ATI) following 32 weeks of continuous ART.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Colorectal and lymph node tissues, bone marrow, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and very large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained longitudinally from both participants and were studied for HIV persistence in several laboratories using molecular and culture-based detection methods, including a murine viral outgrowth assay (mVOA). Both participants initiated PrEP with tenofovir/emtricitabine during very early Fiebig stage I (detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, antibody negative) followed by 4-drug ART intensification. Following peak viral loads, both participants experienced full suppression of HIV-1 plasma viremia. Over the following 2 years, no further HIV could be detected in blood or tissue from PrEP Participant A despite extensive sampling from ileum, rectum, lymph nodes, bone marrow, CSF, circulating CD4+ T cell subsets, and plasma. No HIV was detected from tissues obtained from PrEP Participant B, but low-level HIV RNA or DNA was intermittently detected from various CD4+ T cell subsets. Over 500 million CD4+ T cells were assayed from both participants in a humanized mouse outgrowth assay. Three of 8 mice infused with CD4+ T cells from PrEP Participant B developed viremia (50 million input cells/surviving mouse), but only 1 of 10 mice infused with CD4+ T cells from PrEP Participant A (53 million input cells/mouse) experienced very low level viremia (201 copies/mL); sequence confirmation was unsuccessful. PrEP Participant A stopped ART and remained aviremic for 7.4 months, rebounding with HIV RNA of 36 copies/mL that rose to 59,805 copies/mL 6 days later. ART was restarted promptly. Rebound plasma HIV sequences were identical to those obtained during acute infection by single-genome sequencing. Mathematical modeling predicted that the latent reservoir size was approximately 200 cells prior to ATI and that only around 1% of individuals with a similar HIV burden may achieve lifelong ART-free remission. Furthermore, we observed that lymphocytes expressing the tumor marker CD30 increased in frequency weeks to months prior to detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma. This study was limited by the small sample size, which was a result of the rarity of individuals presenting during hyperacute infection.CONCLUSIONS: We report HIV relapse despite initiation of ART at one of the earliest stages of acute HIV infection possible. Near complete or complete loss of detectable HIV in blood and tissues did not lead to indefinite ART-free HIV remission. However, the small numbers of latently infected cells in individuals treated during hyperacute infection may be associated with prolonged ART-free remission. labels: #Adult#Anti-Retroviral Agents#Biomarkers#Flow Cytometry#HIV Infections#HIV-1#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Phenotype#Prospective Studies#Recurrence#Secondary Prevention#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Gaps in the HIV care continuum contribute to poor health outcomes and increase HIV transmission. A combination of interventions targeting multiple steps in the continuum is needed to achieve the full beneficial impact of HIV treatment.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Link4Health, a cluster-randomized controlled trial, evaluated the effectiveness of a combination intervention strategy (CIS) versus the standard of care (SOC) on the primary outcome of linkage to care within 1 month plus retention in care at 12 months after HIV-positive testing. Ten clusters of HIV clinics in Swaziland were randomized 1:1 to CIS versus SOC. The CIS included point-of-care CD4+ testing at the time of an HIV-positive test, accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for treatment-eligible participants, mobile phone appointment reminders, health educational packages, and noncash financial incentives. Secondary outcomes included each component of the primary outcome, mean time to linkage, assessment for ART eligibility, ART initiation and time to ART initiation, viral suppression defined as HIV-1 RNA<1,000 copies/mL at 12 months after HIV testing among patients on ART \xe2\x89\xa56 months, and loss to follow-up and death at 12 months after HIV testing. A total of 2,197 adults aged \xe2\x89\xa518 years, newly tested HIV positive, were enrolled from 19 August 2013 to 21 November 2014 (1,096 CIS arm; 1,101 SOC arm) and followed for 12 months. The median participant age was 31 years (IQR 26-39), and 59% were women. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 64% (705/1,096) of participants at the CIS sites achieved the primary outcome versus 43% (477/1,101) at the SOC sites (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.96, p = 0.002). Participants in the CIS arm versus the SOC arm had the following secondary outcomes: linkage to care regardless of retention at 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97-1.21, p = 0.13), mean time to linkage (2.5 days versus 7.5 days, p = 0.189), retention in care at 12 months regardless of time to linkage (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18-1.86, p = 0.002), assessment for ART eligibility (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.34, p = 0.004), ART initiation (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.40, p = 0.12), mean time to ART initiation from time of HIV testing (7 days versus 14 days, p<0.001), viral suppression among those on ART for \xe2\x89\xa56 months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07, p = 0.55), loss to follow-up at 12 months after HIV testing (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.79, p = 0.002), and death (N = 78) within 12 months of HIV testing (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46-1.35, p = 0.41). Limitations of this study include a small number of clusters and the inability to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of individual components of the combination strategy.CONCLUSIONS: A combination strategy inclusive of 5 evidence-based interventions aimed at multiple steps in the HIV care continuum was associated with significant increase in linkage to care plus 12-month retention. This strategy offers promise of enhanced outcomes for HIV-positive patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01904994. labels: #Adult#CD4 Lymphocyte Count#Clinical Protocols#Cluster Analysis#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Male#Medication Adherence#Patient Compliance#Program Evaluation#Swaziland'
b'Reassortment, which is the exchange of genome sequence between viruses co-infecting a host cell, plays an important role in the evolution of segmented viruses. In the human influenza virus, reassortment happens most frequently between co-existing variants within the same lineage. This process breaks genetic linkage and fitness correlations between viral genome segments, but the resulting net effect on viral fitness has remained unclear. In this paper, we determine rate and average selective effect of reassortment processes in the human influenza lineage A/H3N2. For the surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, reassortant variants with a mean distance of at least 3 nucleotides to their parent strains get established at a rate of about 10-2 in units of the neutral point mutation rate. Our inference is based on a new method to map reassortment events from joint genealogies of multiple genome segments, which is tested by extensive simulations. We show that intra-lineage reassortment processes are, on average, under substantial negative selection that increases in strength with increasing sequence distance between the parent strains. The deleterious effects of reassortment manifest themselves in two ways: there are fewer reassortment events than expected from a null model of neutral reassortment, and reassortant strains have fewer descendants than their non-reassortant counterparts. Our results suggest that influenza evolves under ubiquitous epistasis across proteins, which produces fitness barriers against reassortment even between co-circulating strains within one lineage. labels: #Evolution, Molecular#Genome, Viral#Humans#Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype#Influenza, Human#Reassortant Viruses'
b'Objective\xc2\xa0To investigate whether symptomatic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is non-inferior to antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in women, thus offering an opportunity to reduce antibiotic use in ambulatory care.Design\xc2\xa0Randomised, double blind, non-inferiority trial.Setting\xc2\xa017 general practices in Switzerland.Participants\xc2\xa0253 women with uncomplicated lower UTI were randomly assigned 1:1 to symptomatic treatment with the NSAID diclofenac (n=133) or antibiotic treatment with norfloxacin (n=120). The randomisation sequence was computer generated, stratified by practice, blocked, and concealed using sealed, sequentially numbered drug containers.Main outcome measures\xc2\xa0The primary outcome was resolution of symptoms at day 3 (72 hours after randomisation and 12 hours after intake of the last study drug). The prespecified principal secondary outcome was the use of any antibiotic (including norfloxacin and fosfomycin as trial drugs) up to day 30. Analysis was by intention to treat.Results\xc2\xa072/133 (54%) women assigned to diclofenac and 96/120 (80%) assigned to norfloxacin experienced symptom resolution at day 3 (risk difference 27%, 95% confidence interval 15% to 38%, P=0.98 for non-inferiority, P<0.001 for superiority). The median time until resolution of symptoms was four days in the diclofenac group and two days in the norfloxacin group. A total of 82 (62%) women in the diclofenac group and 118 (98%) in the norfloxacin group used antibiotics up to day 30 (risk difference 37%, 28% to 46%, P<0.001 for superiority). Six women in the diclofenac group (5%) but none in the norfloxacin group received a clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis (P=0.03).Conclusion\xc2\xa0Diclofenac is inferior to norfloxacin for symptom relief of UTI and is likely to be associated with an increased risk of pyelonephritis, even though it reduces antibiotic use in women with uncomplicated lower UTI.Trial registration\xc2\xa0ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01039545. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Ambulatory Care#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal#Double-Blind Method#Female#General Practice#Humans#Middle Aged#Norfloxacin#Switzerland#Treatment Outcome#Urinary Tract Infections'
b'Objective\xc2\xa0To evaluate how selection of patients for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing affects the diagnosis of myocardial infarction across different healthcare settings.Design\xc2\xa0Prospective study of three independent consecutive patient populations presenting to emergency departments.Setting\xc2\xa0Secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the United Kingdom and United States.Participants\xc2\xa0High sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in 8500 consecutive patients presenting to emergency departments: unselected patients in the UK (n=1054) and two selected populations of patients in whom troponin testing was requested by the attending clinician in the UK (n=5815) and the US (n=1631). The final diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury was independently adjudicated.Main outcome measures\xc2\xa0Positive predictive value of an elevated cardiac troponin concentration for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction.Results\xc2\xa0Cardiac troponin concentrations were elevated in 13.7% (144/1054) of unselected patients, with a prevalence of 1.6% (17/1054) for type 1 myocardial infarction and a positive predictive value of 11.8% (95% confidence interval 7.0% to 18.2%). In selected patients, in whom troponin testing was guided by the attending clinician, the prevalence and positive predictive value were 14.5% (843/5815) and 59.7% (57.0% to 62.2%) in the UK and 4.2% (68/1631) and 16.4% (13.0% to 20.3%) in the US. Across both selected patient populations, the positive predictive value was highest in patients with chest pain, with ischaemia on the electrocardiogram, and with a history of ischaemic heart disease.Conclusions\xc2\xa0When high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is performed widely or without previous clinical assessment, elevated troponin concentrations are common and predominantly reflect myocardial injury rather than myocardial infarction. These observations highlight how selection of patients for cardiac troponin testing varies across healthcare settings and markedly influences the positive predictive value for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. labels: #Emergency Service, Hospital#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Myocardial Infarction#Patient Selection#Predictive Value of Tests#Prevalence#Prospective Studies#Sensitivity and Specificity#Troponin I#United Kingdom#United States'
b'Purpose: To evaluate macular and peripapillary vessel perfusion density (VD) in glaucoma suspects (GS) and glaucoma patients; to correlate ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses with macular and peripapillary VD; and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the structural and vascular parameters.Methods: A consecutive series of GS, glaucoma patients, and healthy subjects was prospectively recruited from July 1, 2016, to January 31, 2017. All subjects underwent standard automated perimetry, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and 6 \xc3\x97 6-mm optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) centered on the fovea and optic nerve.Results: Forty controls, 40 GS, and 40 glaucoma patients were enrolled. Peripapillary RNFL, GCIPL, and macular RNFL thicknesses significantly decreased in the glaucoma group compared to controls and GS (P<0.01). Peripapillary VD in average and in the superior and inferior quadrants decreased in the glaucoma group (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.001); conversely, macular VD was not statistically different across groups (P>0.05). At the peripapillary area, a correlation between RNFL thickness and VD was found; conversely, no statistically significant correlation was found between GCIPL thicknesses and macular VD (all P>0.05) in all groups. Peripapillary RNFL and GCIPL showed higher diagnostic capacity compared to peripapillary and macular VDs.Conclusions: Structural damage is evident both in the peripapillary and in macular areas. Vascular damage seems to be less prominent, as it was seen only for the glaucoma group and at the radial peripapillary plexus. Diagnostic abilities are excellent for structural variables, less so but still good for peripapillary VD, and poor for macular VD. labels: #Computed Tomography Angiography#Female#Glaucoma, Open-Angle#Healthy Volunteers#Humans#Intraocular Pressure#Macula Lutea#Male#Middle Aged#Nerve Fibers#Ocular Hypertension#Optic Disk#Perfusion Imaging#Prospective Studies#Regional Blood Flow#Retinal Ganglion Cells#Retinal Vessels#Tomography, Optical Coherence#Visual Field Tests'
b'Purpose: To analyze the presence of complex alleles of the ABCA4 gene in Brazilian patients with Stargardt disease and to assess the correlation with clinical features.Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study. Patients with a diagnosis of Stargardt disease who presented three pathogenic variants of the ABCA4 gene or who had variants previously described as complex alleles were included. The relatives of these probands were evaluated in the segregation analysis. The patients were evaluated based on age at symptom onset and visual acuity, and the clinical characteristics were classified according to the findings observed on autofluorescence examination.Results: Among the 47 families analyzed, approximately 30% (14/47) presented complex alleles. The segregation analysis in 14 families with cases of Stargardt disease identified three novel complex alleles and one previously described complex allele. The known complex allele p.[Leu541Pro; Ala1038Val] was identified in two families. The novel complex alleles identified were p.[Leu541Pro; Arg1443His]in five families, p.[Ser1642Arg; Val1682_Val1686del] in seven families, and p.[Pro1761Arg; Arg2106Cys]in one family. Furthermore, four new variants (p.Lys22Asn, p.Asp915Asn, p.Glu1447Val, and p.Pro1761Arg) were identified in the second allele of the ABCA4 gene.Conclusions: Segregation analysis is important in order to confirm the molecular diagnosis of patients with Stargardt disease, given the frequency of complex alleles in the ABCA4 gene. The various pathogenic variation combinations observed in this study were associated with different phenotypes. labels: #ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters#Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Alleles#Brazil#Child#Cross-Sectional Studies#DNA Mutational Analysis#Electroretinography#Female#Genetic Association Studies#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Macular Degeneration#Male#Middle Aged#Mutation#Pedigree#Retina#Visual Acuity#Young Adult'
b'Purpose: To evaluate the contribution of fixational saccades toward fixation instability in strabismic monkeys.Methods: Binocular eye movements were measured as six experimental monkeys (five strabismic monkeys and one monkey with downbeat nystagmus) and one normal monkey fixated targets of two shapes (Optotype, Disk) and two sizes (0.5\xc2\xb0, 2\xc2\xb0) during monocular and binocular viewing. Fixational saccades were detected using an unsupervised clustering algorithm.Results: When compared with the normal monkey, amplitude and frequency of fixational saccades in both the viewing and nonviewing eye were greater in 3 of 5 strabismic monkeys (1-way ANOVA on ranks P<0.001; median amplitude in the normal monkey viewing eye: 0.33\xc2\xb0; experimental animals: median amplitude range 0.20-0.82\xc2\xb0; median frequency in the normal monkey: 1.35/s; experimental animals: median frequency range 1.3-3.7/s). Increase in frequency of fixational saccades was largely due to quick phases of ongoing nystagmus. Fixational saccade amplitude was increased significantly (3-way ANOVA; P<0.001) but by small magnitude depending on target shape and size (mean difference between disk and optotype targets = 0.02\xc2\xb0; mean difference between 2\xc2\xb0 and 0.5\xc2\xb0 targets = 0.1\xc2\xb0). Relationship between saccade amplitude and the Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA) was nonlinear, showing saturation of saccade amplitude. Fixation instability in depth was significantly greater in strabismic monkeys (vergence BCEA: 0.63 deg2-2.15 deg2) compared with the normal animal (vergence BCEA: 0.15 deg2; P<0.001).Conclusions: Increased fixational instability in strabismic monkeys is only partially due to increased amplitude and more frequent fixational saccades. Target parameter effects on fixational saccades are similar to previous findings of target effects on BCEA. labels: #Animals#Disease Models, Animal#Fixation, Ocular#Macaca mulatta#Nystagmus, Pathologic#Saccades#Strabismus#Vision, Binocular'
b'Purpose: To establish a model of the retinal capillary circulation in pigs, which in many aspects is close to the human retina.Methods: Using high density confocal microscopy image stacks of immunolabeled porcine retinal whole mounts, microvessels close to the optic nerve head were traced in three dimensions. The direction of flow of individual capillaries was deduced from their arteriolar and/or venous connections.Results: From major arteries, second-order arteries traversed the nerve fiber layer and resolved exclusively into the superficial vascular plexus (SVP), which dichotomized the blood flow between radial peripapillary capillaries (RPCs) on one side and the intermediate (IVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) on the other. Each RPC was supplied by one or several capillaries from the SVP and drained to the IVP or DVP. The DVP was a mosaic of approximately 300 to 600 \xce\xbcm wide anastomotic watersheds, each drained by one or two venules connected to major veins. A presumptive direction of flow could be determined for>90% of capillaries. These results suggest a model of the capillary circulation in which the three microvessel layers are serially organized with RPCs are in parallel between the SVP and IVP or DVP.Conclusions: In the peripapillary retina of pigs, microvascular layers have a serial arrangement, with RPCs emerging from the SVP and draining to the IVP or DVP; hence, connected in parallel of this scheme. The bulk of flow, therefore, traverses the SVP and DVP successively. This organization contributes to the higher oxygen saturation in the SVP and RPCs than in the DVP. Physiopathologic implications of this model regarding retinal diseases are discussed. labels: #Animals#Capillaries#Fluorescein Angiography#Imaging, Three-Dimensional#Male#Microcirculation#Microscopy, Confocal#Models, Biological#Optic Disk#Regional Blood Flow#Retinal Artery#Retinal Vein#Sus scrofa#Tomography, Optical Coherence'
b'Purpose: Cromakalim prodrug 1 (CKLP1) is a water-soluble ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener that has shown ocular hypotensive properties in ex vivo and in vivo experimental models. To determine its mechanism of action, we assessed the effect of CKLP1 on aqueous humor dynamics and in combination therapy with existing ocular hypotensive agents.Methods: Outflow facility was assessed in C57BL/6 mice by ex vivo eye perfusions and by in vivo constant flow infusion following CKLP1 treatment. Human anterior segments with no trabecular meshwork were evaluated for effect on pressure following CKLP1 treatment. CKLP1 alone and in combination with latanoprost, timolol, and Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 were evaluated for effect on intraocular pressure in C57BL/6 mice and Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits.Results: CKLP1 lowered episcleral venous pressure (control: 8.9 \xc2\xb1 0.1 mm Hg versus treated: 6.2 \xc2\xb1 0.1 mm Hg, P<0.0001) but had no detectable effect on outflow facility, aqueous humor flow rate, or uveoscleral outflow. Treatment with CKLP1 in human anterior segments without the trabecular meshwork resulted in a 50% \xc2\xb1 9% decrease in pressure, suggesting an effect on the distal portion of the conventional outflow pathway. CKLP1 worked additively with latanoprost, timolol, and Y27632 to lower IOP, presumably owing to combined effects on different aspects of aqueous humor dynamics.Conclusions: CKLP1 lowered intraocular pressure by reducing episcleral venous pressure and lowering distal outflow resistance in the conventional outflow pathway. Owing to this unique mechanism of action, CKLP1 works in an additive manner to lower intraocular pressure with latanoprost, timolol, and Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632. labels: #Amides#Animals#Anterior Eye Segment#Antihypertensive Agents#Aqueous Humor#Cromakalim#Drug Synergism#Drug Therapy, Combination#Female#Humans#Intraocular Pressure#Male#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Middle Aged#Ophthalmic Solutions#Prodrugs#Prostaglandins F, Synthetic#Pyridines#Rabbits#Sclera#Timolol#Tonometry, Ocular#Venous Pressure'
b'INTRODUCTION: Transection of the rectum at the anorectal junction is required for proper resection in ulcerative colitis and restorative proctocolectomy. Achieving stapled transection at the pelvic floor is often challenging, particularly during laparoscopic proctectomy. Transanal mucosectomy and handsewn anastomosis are frequently used to achieve adequate resection. Rectal eversion provides an alternative for low anorectal transection and maintains the ability to perform stapled anastomosis.TECHNIQUE: The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for low anorectal transection. The work was conducted at tertiary care center by 2 colon and rectal surgeons on patients undergoing total proctocolectomy with creation of ileal pouch rectal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. We measured the ability to achieve low stapled anastomosis.RESULTS: Very low transection was achieved, allowing for creation of IPAA without leaving significant rectal cuff. This study was limited because it is an early experience that was not performed in the setting of a scientific investigation. No sphincter or bowel functional data were obtained or evaluated.CONCLUSIONS: Rectal eversion technique provides an alternative to mucosectomy when low pelvic transection is difficult to achieve.

b'The aim of this study is to evaluate the application and accuracy of polymer gels for determining electron dose distributions in the presence of small heterogeneities made of bone and air. Different cylindrical phantoms containing MAGIC (Methacrylic and Ascorbic acid in Gelatin Initiated by Copper) normoxic polymer gel were used under the slab phantoms during irradiation. MR images of the irradiated gel phantoms were obtained to determine their R2 (spin-spin) relaxation maps for conversion to absorbed dose. One- and 2-dimensional lateral dose profiles were acquired at depths of 1 and 4 cm for 8 and 15 MeV electron beams. The results were compared with the doses measured by a diode detector at the same positions. In addition, the dose distribution in the axial orientation was measured by the gel dosimeter. The slope and intercept for the R2 versus dose curve were 0.509 \xc2\xb1 0.002 Gy s and 4.581 \xc2\xb1 0.005 s, respectively. No significant variation in dose-R2 response was seen for the two electron energies within the applied dose ranges. The mean dose difference between the measured gel dose profiles was smaller than 3% compared to those measured by the diode detector. These results provide further demonstration that electron dose distributions are significantly altered in the presence of tissue inhomogeneities such as bone and air cavity and that MAGIC gel is a useful tool for 3-dimensional dose visualization and qualitative assessment of tissue inhomogeneity effects in electron beam dosimetry. labels: #Anisotropy#Electrons#Equipment Design#Equipment Failure Analysis#Gels#Polymers#Radiation Dosage#Radiometry#Reproducibility of Results#Scattering, Radiation#Sensitivity and Specificity'
b'The pharmacokinetic equations of Pierson et al. describing the behavior of bromide in rat provide a general approach to the modeling of extracellular fluid (ECF). The movement of material into ECF spaces is rapid and is completely characterized by tissue volumes and vascular flow rates to and from a tissue, the volumes of the tissue, and the ECF associated with the tissue. Early-time measurements are needed to characterize ECF. Measurements of DTPA disappearance from plasma by Wedeking et al. are discussed as an example of such measurements. In any biokinetic model, the fastest transfer rates are not determinable with the usual datasets, and if determined empirically, these rates will have very large and highly correlated uncertainties, so particular values of these rates, even though the model fits the available data, are not significant. A pharmacokinetic front-end provides values for these fast rates. An example of such a front-end for a 200-g rat is given. labels: #Animals#Blood Flow Velocity#Computer Simulation#Extracellular Fluid#Kinetics#Metabolic Clearance Rate#Models, Biological#Organ Size#Radiopharmaceuticals#Rats#Tissue Distribution'
b"INTRODUCTION: Sub-Saharan Africa bears more than two-thirds of the worldwide burden of HIV; however, data among transgender women from the region are sparse. Transgender women across the world face significant vulnerability to HIV. This analysis aimed to assess HIV prevalence as well as psychosocial and behavioral drivers of HIV infection among transgender women compared with cisgender (non-transgender) men who have sex with men (cis-MSM) in 8 sub-Saharan African countries.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Respondent-driven sampling targeted cis-MSM for enrollment. Data collection took place at 14 sites across 8 countries: Burkina Faso (January-August 2013), C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire (March 2015-February 2016), The Gambia (July-December 2011), Lesotho (February-September 2014), Malawi (July 2011-March 2012), Senegal (February-November 2015), Swaziland (August-December 2011), and Togo (January-June 2013). Surveys gathered information on sexual orientation, gender identity, stigma, mental health, sexual behavior, and HIV testing. Rapid tests for HIV were conducted. Data were merged, and mixed effects logistic regression models were used to estimate relationships between gender identity and HIV infection. Among 4,586 participants assigned male sex at birth, 937 (20%) identified as transgender or female, and 3,649 were cis-MSM. The mean age of study participants was approximately 24 years, with no difference between transgender participants and cis-MSM. Compared to cis-MSM participants, transgender women were more likely to experience family exclusion (odds ratio [OR]1.75, 95% CI 1.42-2.16, p<0.001), rape (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.63-2.36, p<0.001), and depressive symptoms (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.52, p<0.001). Transgender women were more likely to report condomless receptive anal sex in the prior 12 months (OR 2.44, 95% CI 2.05-2.90, p<0.001) and to be currently living with HIV (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.49-2.19, p<0.001). Overall HIV prevalence was 25% (235/926) in transgender women and 14% (505/3,594) in cis-MSM. When adjusted for age, condomless receptive anal sex, depression, interpersonal stigma, law enforcement stigma, and violence, and the interaction of gender with condomless receptive anal sex, the odds of HIV infection for transgender women were 2.2 times greater than the odds for cis-MSM (95% CI 1.65-2.87, p<0.001). Limitations of the study included sampling strategies tailored for cis-MSM and merging of datasets with non-identical survey instruments.CONCLUSIONS: In this study in sub-Saharan Africa, we found that HIV burden and stigma differed between transgender women and cis-MSM, indicating a need to address gender diversity within HIV research and programs. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Africa South of the Sahara#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#HIV Infections#Health Surveys#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Prevalence#Risk Factors#Sexual Behavior#Social Stigma#Transgender Persons"

b'BACKGROUND: Retention in care is an essential component of meeting the UNAIDS "90-90-90" HIV treatment targets. In Khayelitsha township (population ~500,000) in Cape Town, South Africa, more than 50,000 patients have received antiretroviral therapy (ART) since the inception of this public-sector program in 2001. Disengagement from care remains an important challenge. We sought to determine the incidence of and risk factors associated with disengagement from care during 2013-2014 and outcomes for those who disengaged.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients \xe2\x89\xa510 years of age who visited 1 of the 13 Khayelitsha ART clinics from 2013-2014 regardless of the date they initiated ART. We described the cumulative incidence of first disengagement (>180 days not attending clinic) between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014 using competing risks methods, enabling us to estimate disengagement incidence up to 10 years after ART initiation. We also described risk factors for disengagement based on a Cox proportional hazards model, using multiple imputation for missing data. We ascertained outcomes (death, return to care, hospital admission, other hospital contact, alive but not in care, no information) after disengagement until 30 June 2015 using province-wide health databases and the National Death Registry. Of 39,884 patients meeting our eligibility criteria, the median time on ART to 31 December 2014 was 33.6 months (IQR 12.4-63.2). Of the total study cohort, 592 (1.5%) died in the study period, 1,231 (3.1%) formally transferred out, 987 (2.5%) were silent transfers and visited another Western Cape province clinic within 180 days, 9,005 (22.6%) disengaged, and 28,069 (70.4%) remained in care. Cumulative incidence of disengagement from care was estimated to be 25.1% by 2 years and 50.3% by 5 years on ART. Key factors associated with disengagement (age, male sex, pregnancy at ART start [HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.47-1.69], most recent CD4 count) and retention (ART club membership, baseline CD4) after adjustment were similar to those found in previous studies; however, notably, the higher hazard of disengagement soon after starting ART was no longer present after adjusting for these risk factors. Of the 9,005 who disengaged, the 2 most common initial outcomes were return to ART care after 180 days (33%; n = 2,976) and being alive but not in care in the Western Cape (25%; n = 2,255). After disengagement, a total of 1,459 (16%) patients were hospitalized and 237 (3%) died. The median follow-up from date of disengagement to 30 June 2015 was 16.7 months (IQR 11-22.4). As we included only patient follow-up from 2013-2014 by design in order to maximize the generalizability of our findings to current programs, this limited our ability to more fully describe temporal trends in first disengagement.CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-three percent of ART patients in the large cohort of Khayelitsha, one of the oldest public-sector ART programs in South Africa, disengaged from care at least once in a contemporary 2-year period. Fifty-eight percent of these patients either subsequently returned to care (some "silently") or remained alive without hospitalization, suggesting that many who are considered "lost" actually return to care, and that misclassification of "lost" patients is likely common in similar urban populations. A challenge to meeting ART retention targets is developing, testing, and implementing program designs to target mobile populations and retain them in lifelong care. This should be guided by risk factors for disengagement and improving interlinkage of routine information systems to better support patient care across complex care platforms. labels: #Adult#Age Factors#Anti-Retroviral Agents#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Incidence#Male#Medication Adherence#Patient Acceptance of Health Care#Registries#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sex Factors#South Africa'
b'BACKGROUND: Illness-related costs for patients with tuberculosis (TB) \xe2\x89\xa520% of pre-illness annual household income predict adverse treatment outcomes and have been termed "catastrophic." Social protection initiatives, including cash transfers, are endorsed to help prevent catastrophic costs. With this aim, cash transfers may either be provided to defray TB-related costs of households with a confirmed TB diagnosis (termed a "TB-specific" approach); or to increase income of households with high TB risk to strengthen their economic resilience (termed a "TB-sensitive" approach). The impact of cash transfers provided with each of these approaches might vary. We undertook an economic modelling study from the patient perspective to compare the potential of these 2 cash transfer approaches to prevent catastrophic costs.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Model inputs for 7 low- and middle-income countries (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Mexico, Tanzania, and Yemen) were retrieved by literature review and included countries\' mean patient TB-related costs, mean household income, mean cash transfers, and estimated TB-specific and TB-sensitive target populations. Analyses were completed for drug-susceptible (DS) TB-related costs in all 7 out of 7 countries, and additionally for drug-resistant (DR) TB-related costs in 1 of the 7 countries with available data. All cost data were reported in 2013 international dollars ($). The target population for TB-specific cash transfers was poor households with a confirmed TB diagnosis, and for TB-sensitive cash transfers was poor households already targeted by countries\' established poverty-reduction cash transfer programme. Cash transfers offered in countries, unrelated to TB, ranged from $217 to $1,091/year/household. Before cash transfers, DS TB-related costs were catastrophic in 6 out of 7 countries. If cash transfers were provided with a TB-specific approach, alone they would be insufficient to prevent DS TB catastrophic costs in 4 out of 6 countries, and when increased enough to prevent DS TB catastrophic costs would require a budget between $3.8 million (95% CI: $3.8 million-$3.8 million) and $75 million (95% CI: $50 million-$100 million) per country. If instead cash transfers were provided with a TB-sensitive approach, alone they would be insufficient to prevent DS TB-related catastrophic costs in any of the 6 countries, and when increased enough to prevent DS TB catastrophic costs would require a budget between $298 million (95% CI: $219 million-$378 million) and $165,367 million (95% CI: $134,085 million-$196,425 million) per country. DR TB-related costs were catastrophic before and after TB-specific or TB-sensitive cash transfers in 1 out of 1 countries. Sensitivity analyses showed our findings to be robust to imputation of missing TB-related cost components, and use of 10% or 30% instead of 20% as the threshold for measuring catastrophic costs. Key limitations were using national average data and not considering other health and social benefits of cash transfers.CONCLUSIONS: A TB-sensitive cash transfer approach to increase all poor households\' income may have broad benefits by reducing poverty, but is unlikely to be as effective or affordable for preventing TB catastrophic costs as a TB-specific cash transfer approach to defray TB-related costs only in poor households with a confirmed TB diagnosis. Preventing DR TB-related catastrophic costs will require considerable additional investment whether a TB-sensitive or a TB-specific cash transfer approach is used. labels: #Antitubercular Agents#Developing Countries#Health Care Costs#Humans#Income#Models, Economic#Poverty Areas#Socioeconomic Factors#Tuberculosis#Vulnerable Populations'
b'Driven by oncogenic signaling, glutamine addiction exhibited by cancer cells often leads to severe glutamine depletion in solid tumors. Despite this nutritional environment that tumor cells often experience, the effect of glutamine deficiency on cellular responses to DNA damage and chemotherapeutic treatment remains unclear. Here, we show that glutamine deficiency, through the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, inhibits the AlkB homolog (ALKBH) enzymes activity and induces DNA alkylation damage. As a result, glutamine deprivation or glutaminase inhibitor treatment triggers DNA damage accumulation independent of cell death. In addition, low glutamine-induced DNA damage is abolished in ALKBH deficient cells. Importantly, we show that glutaminase inhibitors, 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) or CB-839, hypersensitize cancer cells to alkylating agents both in vitro and in vivo. Together, the crosstalk between glutamine metabolism and the DNA repair pathway identified in this study highlights a potential role of metabolic stress in genomic instability and therapeutic response in cancer. labels: #AlkB Enzymes#AlkB Homolog 3, Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase#Alkylation#Animals#Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating#Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Apoptosis#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Proliferation#DNA Damage#Enzyme Inhibitors#Glutaminase#Humans#Male#Mice#Mice, Nude#Neoplasm Proteins#Neoplasms#RNA Interference#Random Allocation#Tumor Burden#Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays'
b'Objectives\xc2\xa0To revise an existing three-talk model for learning how to achieve shared decision making, and to consult with relevant stakeholders to update and obtain wider engagement.Design\xc2\xa0Multistage consultation process.Setting\xc2\xa0Key informant group, communities of interest, and survey of clinical specialties.Participants\xc2\xa019 key informants, 153 member responses from multiple communities of interest, and 316 responses to an online survey from medically qualified clinicians from six specialties.Results\xc2\xa0After extended consultation over three iterations, we revised the three-talk model by making changes to one talk category, adding the need to elicit patient goals, providing a clear set of tasks for each talk category, and adding suggested scripts to illustrate each step. A new three-talk model of shared decision making is proposed, based on "team talk," "option talk," and "decision talk," to depict a process of collaboration and deliberation. Team talk places emphasis on the need to provide support to patients when they are made aware of choices, and to elicit their goals as a means of guiding decision making processes. Option talk refers to the task of comparing alternatives, using risk communication principles. Decision talk refers to the task of arriving at decisions that reflect the informed preferences of patients, guided by the experience and expertise of health professionals.Conclusions\xc2\xa0The revised three-talk model of shared decision making depicts conversational steps, initiated by providing support when introducing options, followed by strategies to compare and discuss trade-offs, before deliberation based on informed preferences. labels: #Clinical Decision-Making#Communication#Decision Making#Humans#Models, Theoretical#Physician-Patient Relations#Referral and Consultation'
b'Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare type of cancer which is an increasingly discernible health threat. The disease is usually very difficult in diagnosis and various treatment modalities are typically not effective. Cholangiocarcinoma is a complex and very heterogeneous malignancy characterized by tumor location, different risk factors, molecular profiling, and prognosis. Cancer cell lines represent an important tool for investigation in various aspects of tumor biology and molecular therapeutics. We established two cell lines, KKU-452 and KKU-023, which were derived from patients residing in the endemic area of liver fluke infection in Thailand. Both of tumor tissues have gross pathology of perihilar and intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma. Two cell lines were characterized for their biological, molecular and genetic properties. KKU-452 and KKU-023 cells are both adherent cells with epithelium morphology, but have some differences in their growth pattern (a doubling time of 17.9 vs 34.8 h, respectively) and the expression of epithelial bile duct markers, CK7 and CK19. Cytogenetic analysis of KKU-452 and KKU-023 cells revealed their highly complex karyotypes; hypertriploid and hypotetraploid, respectively, with multiple chromosomal aberrations. Both cell lines showed mutations in p53 but not in KRAS. KKU-452 showed a very rapid migration and invasion properties in concert with low expression of E-cadherin and high expression of N-cadherin, whereas KKU-023 showed opposite characters. KKU-023, but not KKU-452, showed in vivo tumorigenicity in xenografted nude mice. Those two established cholangiocarcinoma cell lines with unique characters may be valuable for better understanding the process of carcinogenesis and developing new therapeutics for the patients. labels: #Animals#Bile Duct Neoplasms#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Separation#Cholangiocarcinoma#Endemic Diseases#Fascioliasis#Female#Heterografts#Humans#Mice#Middle Aged#Thailand'
b'Xanthones are phytochemical compounds found in a number of fruits and vegetables. Characteristically, they are noted to be made of diverse properties based on their biological, biochemical, and pharmacological actions. Accordingly, the apoptosis mechanisms induced by beta-mangostin, a xanthone compound isolated from Cratoxylum arborescens in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60) in vitro, were examined in this study. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was done to estimate the cytotoxicity effect of \xce\xb2-mangostin on the HL60 cell line. Acridine orange/propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 dyes and Annexin V tests were conducted to detect the apoptosis features. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities; reactive oxygen species; real-time polymerase chain reaction for Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 Hsp70 genes; and western blot for p53, cytochrome c, and pro- and cleavage-caspase-3 and caspase-9 were assessed to examine the apoptosis mechanism. Cell-cycle analysis conducted revealed that \xce\xb2-mangostin inhibited the growth of HL60 at 58\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M in 24\xe2\x80\x89h. The administration of \xce\xb2-mangostin with HL60 caused cell morphological changes related to apoptosis which increased the number of early and late apoptotic cells. The \xce\xb2-mangostin-catalyzed apoptosis action through caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 activation overproduced reactive oxygen species which downregulated the expression of antiapoptotic genes Bcl-2 and HSP70. Conversely, the expression of the apoptotic genes Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were upregulated. Meanwhile, at the protein level, \xce\xb2-mangostin activated the formation of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 and also upregulated the p53. \xce\xb2-mangostin arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1phase. Overall, the results for \xce\xb2-mangostin showed an antiproliferative effect in HL60 via stopping the cell cycle at the G0/G1phase and prompted the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic#Apoptosis#Clusiaceae#Down-Regulation#G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#HL-60 Cells#HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins#Humans#Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute#Plant Extracts#Reactive Oxygen Species#Xanthones'
b'The role of microRNAs in brain cancer is still naive. Some act as oncogene and others as tumor suppressors. Discovery of efficient biomarkers is mandatory to debate that aggressive disease. Bioinformatically selected microRNAs and their targets were investigated to evaluate their putative signature as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in primary glioblastoma multiforme. Expression of a panel of seven microRNAs (hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-326, and hsa-miR-375) and seven target genes ( E2F3, PI3KCA, TOM34, WNT5A, PDCD4, DFFA, and EGFR) in 43 glioblastoma multiforme specimens were profiled compared to non-cancer tissues via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry staining for three proteins (VEGFA, BAX, and BCL2) was performed. Gene enrichment analysis identified the biological regulatory functions of the gene panel in glioma pathway. MGMT ( O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promoter methylation was analyzed for molecular subtyping of tumor specimens. Our data demonstrated a significant upregulation of five microRNAs (hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-221, and hsa-miR-375), three genes ( E2F3, PI3KCA, and Wnt5a), two proteins (VEGFA and BCL2), and downregulation of hsa-miR-34a and three other genes ( DFFA, PDCD4, and EGFR) in brain cancer tissues. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that miR-34a (area under the curve = 0.927) and miR-17 (area under the curve = 0.900) had the highest diagnostic performance, followed by miR-221 (area under the curve = 0.845), miR-21 (area under the curve = 0.836), WNT5A (area under the curve = 0.809), PDCD4 (area under the curve = 0.809), and PI3KCA (area under the curve = 0.800). MGMT promoter methylation status was associated with high miR-221 levels. Moreover, patients with VEGFA overexpression and downregulation of TOM34 and BAX had poor overall survival. Nevertheless, miR-17, miR-221, and miR-326 downregulation were significantly associated with high recurrence rate. Multivariate analysis by hierarchical clustering classified patients into four distinct groups based on gene panel signature. In conclusion, the explored microRNA-target dysregulation could pave the road toward developing potential therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma multiforme. Future translational and functional studies are highly recommended to better understand the complex bio-molecular signature of this difficult-to-treat tumor. labels: #Adult#Area Under Curve#Brain Neoplasms#Cluster Analysis#Female#Glioblastoma#Humans#Male#MicroRNAs#Middle Aged#ROC Curve#Transcriptome'
b'Accurate staging of rectal cancer remains essential for optimal patient selection for combined modality treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We aimed at examining the correlation of cell free DNA with the pathologic stage and subsequent risk of recurrence for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing preoperative chemoradiation. We examined 75 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Blood samples for translational use were drawn prior to rectal surgery. The level of cell free DNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR and expressed as copy number of beta 2 microglobulin. We found a median level of cell free DNA in the AJCC stages I-III of 3100, 8300, and 10,700 copies/mL respectively. For patients with 12 sampled lymph nodes or above, the median level of cell free DNA were 2400 copies/mL and 4400 copies/mL (p = 0.04) for node negative and node positive disease respectively. The median follow-up was 39 months and 11 recurrences were detected (15%). The median level for patients with recurrent disease was 13,000 copies/mL compared to 5200 copies/mL for non-recurrent patients (p = 0.08). We have demonstrated a correlation between the level of total cell free DNA and the pathologic stage and nodal involvement. Furthermore, we have found a trend towards a correlation with the risk of recurrence following resection of localized rectal cancer. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Chemoradiotherapy#DNA#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Neoplasm Staging#Rectal Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome'
b'Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers throughout the world as well as in Bangladesh. This study aimed to correlate the prognostic and/or predictive value of functional polymorphisms in SULT1A1 (rs9282861) and XRCC1 (rs25487) genes and lung cancer risk in Bangladeshi population. A case-control study was conducted which comprises 202 lung cancer patients and 242 healthy volunteers taking into account the age, sex, and smoking status. After isolation of genomic DNA, genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method and the lung cancer risk was evaluated as odds ratio that was adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status. A significant association was found between SULT1A1 rs9282861 and XRCC1 rs25487 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. In case of rs9282861 polymorphism, Arg/His (adjusted odds ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895.06, 95% confidence interval\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893.05-8.41, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) and His/His (adjusted odds ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893.88, 95% confidence interval\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.20-6.82, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) genotypes were strongly associated with increased risk of lung cancer in comparison to the Arg/Arg genotype. In case of rs25487 polymorphism, Arg/Gln heterozygote (adjusted odds ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.57, 95% confidence interval\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.79-7.46, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) and Gln/Gln mutant homozygote (adjusted odds ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.99, 95% confidence interval\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.66-9.36, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) were also found to be significantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer. This study demonstrates that the presence of His allele and Gln allele in case of SULT1A1 rs9282861 and XRCC1 rs25487, respectively, involve in lung cancer prognosis in Bangladeshi population. labels: #Arylsulfotransferase#Bangladesh#Case-Control Studies#DNA-Binding Proteins#Female#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Genotype#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Risk Factors#Smoking#X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1'
b'Since the inception of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure (HF) guidelines in 2006, much has changed in the care for patients with HF. Over the past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations is\xc2\xa0presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores, the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction, exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced therapies as well as end of life considerations. Finally, we acknowledge the remaining gaps in evidence that need to be filled by future research. labels: #Canada#Cardiology#Disease Management#Heart Failure#Humans#Societies, Medical'
b'BACKGROUND: Beginning in February 2012, there was a shortage of injectable furosemide in the province of Ontario, Canada. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the furosemide shortage on heart failure outcomes in Ontario, Canada.METHODS: We determined which hospitals experienced a shortage of injectable furosemide using an online survey. We then used health administrative data to identify all patients who presented to those hospitals with congestive heart failure. Using 40 months of data from before the shortage, we determined the proportion of patients with heart failure expected to die each month. We then used time series analysis to forecast the 30-day mortality rate during the shortage period and compared it with the observed rate. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, transfer to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation during the hospital stay, and risk of 30-day readmission for heart failure.RESULTS: Survey results were obtained for 82% of hospitals, 28 of which experienced a severe shortage of injectable furosemide in the year 2012. The 30-day mortality among patients presenting to these hospitals with congestive heart failure before the shortage period was 11.2%. We forecasted a mortality rate of 11.3% (95% confidence interval, 8.2-14.4) for the shortage period, which was not significantly different from the observed rate of 10.9%. Similarly, we found no significant effect of the shortage on secondary outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: A severe shortage of injectable furosemide did not increase the risk of adverse outcomes among patients who presented to the hospital with congestive heart failure. labels: #Diuretics#Female#Furosemide#Heart Failure#Hospital Mortality#Humans#Length of Stay#Male#Ontario#Retrospective Studies#Survival Rate'
b'BACKGROUND: Studies examining treatment delay and survival after surgical treatment of colon cancer have varied in quality and outcome, with little evidence available regarding the safety of longer surgical treatment wait times.OBJECTIVE: Our study examined the effect of surgical treatment wait times on survival for patients with stage I to III colon cancer.DESIGN: A subset cohort analysis was performed using data from a prospectively maintained database.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Data on all of the patients undergoing elective surgery for stage I to III colon cancer from 2006 to 2015 were collected from a prospectively maintained clinical and administrative database.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined the impact of prolonged wait time to surgery on disease-free and overall survival. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on a treatment wait time of \xe2\x89\xa430 or>30 days and were compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. A subgroup analysis was performed using alternative treatment delay cutoffs of 60 and 90 days.RESULTS: There were 908 patients with stage I to III colon cancer treated over the study period, with a median treatment wait time of 38 days (interquartile range, 21-61 days); 368 patients were treated within 30 days, and 540 were treated beyond 30 days from diagnosis. In adjusted multivariate analysis, a treatment delay of>30 days was not associated with decreased disease-free survival (HR = 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61-1.3); p = 0.52) or overall survival (HR = 0.82 (95% CI, 0.63-1.1); p = 0.16). Likewise, subgroup analysis using alternative treatment delay cutoffs of 60 and 90 days did not demonstrate an adverse effect on survival.LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by retrospective analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer median treatment wait times from diagnosis to surgery, with the majority of patients exceeding 30 days and many experiencing delays of 2 to 3 months, no adverse impact on survival was observed. Patients who require additional consultations or investigations preoperatively may safely have their surgery moderately delayed to minimize their perioperative risk without any evidence that this will compromise treatment outcomes.

b'BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with rectal cancer who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy will develop a complete pathologic tumor response. Complete nodal response is not universal in these patients and is difficult to assess clinically. Quantifying the risk of nodal disease would allow for targeted therapy with either radical resection or "watchful waiting."OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify risk factors for residual nodal disease in ypT0 rectal adenocarcinoma.DESIGN: This is a retrospective case control study.SETTINGS: The National Cancer Database 2006 to 2014 was used to identify patients for this study.PATIENTS: Patients with stage II/III rectal adenocarcinoma who completed chemoradiation therapy followed by resection and who had ypT0 tumors were included. Patients with metastatic disease and<2 lymph nodes evaluated were excluded. Patients were divided into 2 groups: node positive and node negative.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was nodal disease. The secondary outcome was overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 42,257 patients with stage II/III rectal cancer underwent chemoradiation therapy and radical resection; 4170 (9.9%) patients had ypT0 tumors and 395 (9.5%) were node positive. Of patients with clinically node-negative disease (ie, pretreatment imaging), 6.2% were node positive after chemoradiation therapy and resection. In multivariable analysis, factors predictive of nodal disease included increasing (pretreatment) clinical N-stage, high tumor grade (3/4), perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion. Higher clinical T-stage was inversely associated with residual nodal disease. Overall 5-year survival was significantly different between patients with ypN0, ypN1, and ypN2 disease (87.4%, 82.2%, and 62.5%, p = 0.002).LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of clinical detail in the database and the inability to assess recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Ten percent of patients with ypT0 tumors had positive nodes after chemoradiation therapy and resection. Factors associated with residual nodal disease included clinical nodal disease at diagnosis and poor histologic features. Patients with any of these features should consider radical resection regardless of tumor response. Others could be suitable for "watchful waiting" strategies.

b'BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer resection.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers versus far, high-volume centers.DESIGN: This was a population-based study.SETTINGS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal cancer.PATIENTS: Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 18,605 patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a lymph node yield \xe2\x89\xa512 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the long-distance/high-volume group.LIMITATIONS: We lacked data regarding patient and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center. They also had improved 5-year survival.

b"BACKGROUND: Short-term results have shown that transanal total mesorectal excision is safe and effective for patients with mid to low rectal cancers. Transanal total mesorectal excision is considered technically challenging; thus, adoption has been limited to a few academic centers in the United States.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe outcomes after the initiation of a transanal total mesorectal excision program in the setting of an academic colorectal training program.DESIGN: This is a single-center retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent transanal total mesorectal excision from December 2014 to August 2016.SETTING: This study was conducted at an academic center with a colorectal residency program.PATIENTS: Patients with benign and malignant diseases were selected.INTERVENTION: All transanal total mesorectal excisions were performed with abdominal and perineal teams working simultaneously.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were pathologic quality, length of hospital stay, 30-day morbidity, and 30-day mortality.RESULTS: There were 40 patients (24 male). The median age was 55 years (interquartile range, 46.7-63.4) with a median BMI of 29\xe2\x80\x89kg/m (interquartile range, 24.6-32.4). The primary indication was cancer (n = 30), and tumor height from the anal verge ranged from 0.5 to 15\xe2\x80\x89cm. Eighty percent (n = 24) of the patients who had rectal cancer received preoperative chemoradiation. The most common procedures were low anterior resection (67.5%), total proctocolectomy (15%), and abdominoperineal resection (12.5%). Median operative time was 380 minutes (interquartile range, 306-454.4), with no change over time. For patients with malignancy, the mesorectum was complete or nearly complete in 100% of the specimens. A median of 14 lymph nodes (interquartile range, 12-17) were harvested, and 100% of the rectal cancer specimens achieved R0 status. Median length of stay was 4.5 days (interquartile range, 4-7), and there were 6 readmissions (15%). There were no deaths or intraoperative complications.LIMITATIONS: This study's limitations derive from its retrospective nature and single-center location.CONCLUSIONS: A transanal total mesorectal excision program can be safely implemented in a major academic medical center. Quality outcomes and patient safety depend on a comprehensive training program and a coordinated team approach.

b"BACKGROUND: The existing scores reflecting the patient's nutritional and inflammatory status do not include all biomarkers and have been poorly studied in colorectal cancers.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess a new prognostic tool, the Naples prognostic score, comparing it with the prognostic nutritional index, controlling nutritional status score, and systemic inflammation score.DESIGN: This was an analysis of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a university hospital.PATIENTS: A total of 562 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in July 2004 through June 2014 and 468 patients undergoing potentially curative surgery were included. MaxStat analysis dichotomized neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte:monocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index, and the controlling nutritional status score. The Naples prognostic scores were divided into 3 groups (group 0, 1, and 2). The receiver operating characteristic curve for censored survival data compared the prognostic performance of the scoring systems.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival and complication rates in all patients, as well as recurrence and disease-free survival rates in radically resected patients, were measured.RESULTS: The Naples prognostic score correlated positively with the other scoring systems (p<0.001) and worsened with advanced tumor stages (p<0.001). Patients with the worst Naples prognostic score experienced more postoperative complications (all patients, p = 0.010; radically resected patients, p = 0.026). Compared with group 0, patients in groups 1 and 2 had worse overall (group 1, HR = 2.90; group 2, HR = 8.01; p<0.001) and disease-free survival rates (group 1, HR = 2.57; group 2, HR = 6.95; p<0.001). Only the Naples prognostic score was an independent significant predictor of overall (HR = 2.0; p = 0.03) and disease-free survival rates (HR = 2.6; p = 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the Naples prognostic score had the best prognostic performance and discriminatory power for overall (p = 0.02) and disease-free survival (p = 0.04).LIMITATIONS: This is a single-center study, and its validity needs additional external validation.CONCLUSIONS: The Naples prognostic score is a simple tool strongly associated with long-term outcome in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer.

However, risk scores specifically derived from surgical cohorts and designed for patients with C difficile infection are currently unavailable.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a risk of death score for patients with C difficile infection who are being considered for total abdominal colectomy because of the failure of medical therapy.DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study.SETTINGS: This study was conducted with the use of a national database.PATIENTS: All patients undergoing total colectomy for C difficile infection were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2014.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variables similar to the original scoring system were used in multivariable analyses to determine the risk of 30-day mortality for patients, and a model was constructed to estimate the predicted probability of mortality after surgery.RESULTS: Of 532 patients who underwent surgery, 32.7% experienced 30-day postoperative mortality. Patient covariates associated with significantly increased mortality included age greater than 80 years (OR 5.5, p = 0.003), need for preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 3.1, p<0.001), chronic steroid use (OR 2.9, p<0.001), underlying cardiopulmonary disease (OR 2.0, p = 0.001), and acute renal failure (OR=1.7, p = 0.03). These and other comorbidities, including hepatic disease, a cancer diagnosis, and both insulin- and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, were used to construct a model to estimate the predicted probability of mortality, which ranged from 8.0% to 96.1% based on individual comorbidity profiles. These estimates differed substantially when compared with those obtained using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program risk calculator, which estimated the risk of mortality among surgical patients as being consistently lower.LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective design.CONCLUSIONS: Our surgical scoring system allows preoperative risk stratification for patients being evaluated for colectomy for C difficile infection, potentially helping to avoid futile surgery.

b'BACKGROUND: Preoperative bowel preparation with or without oral antibiotics is controversial in terms of postoperative surgical site infections.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics as adjunct therapy to systemic antibiotics with mechanical bowel preparation for preventing surgical site infections in clean contaminated, contaminated, and dirty colorectal procedures.DESIGN: This was a single-center, prospective randomized study.SETTING: This study was conducted at the General Surgery Department at Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University, China, from July 15, 2014 to January 20, 2016.PATIENTS: Patients aged \xe2\x89\xa518 years scheduled for abdominal surgery with clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty wounds were selected.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive preoperative mechanical bowel preparation or mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics.MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the rate of surgical site infections. The secondary outcomes were extra-abdominal complications, duration of postoperative ileus, and readmission rate.RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were allocated to each group. Eight and 26 surgical site infections (8.42% vs 27.3 %, p = 0.004) occurred in the mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation groups. Thirteen extra-abdominal complications were reported: 6 in the mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics group and 7 in the mechanical bowel preparation group (6.3% vs 7.3%, p = 0.77). Postoperative ileus duration did not differ between groups (p = 0.23). There were 4 readmissions in the mechanical bowel preparation group and none in the mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics group (p = 0.04). On multivariable analysis, blood loss \xe2\x89\xa5500\xe2\x80\x89mL (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.27-20.4; p = 0.02), ASA score \xe2\x89\xa53 (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.5; p = 0.01), contaminated types (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.6; p = 0.01), and administration of preoperative oral antibiotics (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.60; p = 0.005) independently affected the incidence of surgical site infections.LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center study.CONCLUSION: Preoperative oral antibiotics, as adjunct therapy to systemic antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation, significantly reduced surgical site infections and minimized the readmission rates in clean contaminated, contaminated, and dirty types of colorectal surgery.

b"BACKGROUND: Approximately half of Crohn's patients require intestinal resection, and many need repeat resections.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the increased risk of clinical anastomotic leak in patients with a history of previous intestinal resection undergoing repeat resection with anastomosis for Crohn's disease.DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected departmental data with 100% capture.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at the department of colorectal surgery in a tertiary care teaching hospital between July 2007 and March 2016.PATIENTS: A cohort of consecutive patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with intestinal resection and anastomosis, excluding patients with proximal fecal diversion, were included. The cohort was divided into 2 groups, those with no previous resection compared with those with previous resection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical anastomotic leak within 30 days of surgery was measured.RESULTS: Of the 206 patients who met criteria, 83 patients had previous intestinal resection (40%). The 2 groups were similar in terms of patient factors, immune-suppressing medication use, and procedural factors. Overall, 20 clinical anastomotic leaks were identified (10% leak rate). There were 6 leaks (5%) detected in patients with no previous intestinal resection and 14 leaks (17%) detected in patients with a history of previous intestinal resection (p<0.005). The OR of anastomotic leak in patients with Crohn's disease with previous resection compared with no previous resection was 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3-9.4). Patients with 1 previous resection (n = 53) had a leak rate of 13%, whereas patients with \xe2\x89\xa52 previous resections (n = 30) had a leak rate of 23%. The number of previous resections correlated with increasing risk for clinical anastomotic leak (correlation coefficient = 0.998).LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study with limited data to perform a multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat intestinal resection in patients with Crohn's disease is associated with an increased rate of anastomotic leakage when compared with initial resection despite similar patient, medication, and procedural factors.

b"BACKGROUND: Defective cell-mediated immunity increases the risk of human papillomavirus-associated anal dysplasia and cancer. There is limited information on anal canal disease in patients with IBD.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess anal/vaginal human papillomavirus and anal dysplasia prevalence in patients with IBD.DESIGN: Patients had an anal examination before routine colonoscopy.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a tertiary IBD referral center.PATIENTS: We studied a convenience sample of sexually active male and female patients with IBD who were not on biological therapy.INTERVENTION: Anal examination, anal and vaginal human papillomavirus testing, anal cytology, and high-resolution anoscopy/biopsy were carried out.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anal and vaginal human papillomavirus types, anal cytology, and biopsy grade were measured.RESULTS: Twenty-five male and 21 female evaluable participants, 31 with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 1 with indeterminate colitis, were predominantly white (91.3%), treatment experienced (76.1%), an average age of 38.1 years (range, 22.0-66.0 y), and had an average length of IBD diagnosis of 9.3 years (range, 1.0-33.0 y). Eighteen (39.1%) had an abnormal perianal examination and 3 (6.5%) had an abnormal digital examination. Forty-one (89.1%) had anal human papillomavirus, 16 with a single type and 25 with multiple types (range, 2-5 types). Human papillomavirus type 16 was most common (65.2%), followed by human papillomavirus types 11 and 45 (37.0% each). Nineteen of 21 (90.5%) women had vaginal human papillomavirus. Overall, 21 (45.7%) had abnormal anal cytology. Thirty three (71.7%) had \xe2\x89\xa51 anal biopsy (9 had multiple), with dysplasia diagnosed in 28 (60.9%) and high-grade and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions diagnosed in 4 (8.7%) and 24 (43.5%).LIMITATIONS: No control group was included, and no detailed sexual history was taken.CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of anal and vaginal human papillomavirus and anal dysplasia was demonstrated in the study population outcomes.

b'BACKGROUND: Decision-making for pulse generator implantation for sacral nerve stimulation in the management of fecal incontinence is based on the results of a test phase. Its duration is still a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an early positive response during the test phase could predict implantation of a permanent sacral nerve pulse generator.DESIGN: This was a short-term observational cohort study. A positive response was defined as a>50% decrease of fecal leaks compared with baseline. A multivariate logistic regression was computed to predict pulse generator implantation after the first week of the test phase.SETTINGS: The study was conducted in 3 national referral centers.PATIENTS: From January 2006 to December 2012, 144 patients with fecal incontinence enrolled in a prospectively maintained database completed a 2- to 3-week bowel diary, at baseline and during test phase.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the clinical decision to implant a pulse generator. The primary predictor was a calculated score including the number of leak episodes, bowel movements, and urgencies and the time to defer defecation expressed in minutes during the first screening test week.RESULTS: After the first, second and third week of the test phase, 81 (56%) of 144, 96 (67%) of 144, and 93 (70%) of 131 patients had a positive test. A permanent pulse generator was implanted in 114. Time to defer defecation increased during the 3 weeks of screening. Urgencies were unchanged. The computed score was predictive of a permanent pulse generator implantation (Se = 72.6% (95% CI, 59.8-83.1); Sp = 100% (95% CI, 78.2-100); c-index = 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78-0.94)).LIMITATIONS: No cost analysis or projection based on our proposal to reduce the test phase has been made.CONCLUSIONS: Permanent pulse generator implantation can be safely proposed early (1-week screening) to fast responders. Nonetheless, permanent implantation may be decided as well in patients exhibiting a delayed response. Whether a rapid response to sacral nerve stimulation could be predictive of a long-term response remains to be determined.

b'BACKGROUND: Regenerating muscle at a time remote from injury requires re-expression of cytokines to attract stem cells to start and sustain the process of repair.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the sustainability of muscle regeneration after treatment with a nonviral plasmid expressing stromal cell-derived factor 1.DESIGN: This was a randomized study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted with animals in a single research facility.INTERVENTIONS: Fifty-six female age-/weight-matched Sprague-Dawley rats underwent excision of the ventral half of the anal sphincter complex. Three weeks later, rats were randomly allocated (n = 8) to one of the following groups: no treatment, 100 \xce\xbcg of plasmid encoding stromal cell-derived factor 1 injected locally, local injection of plasmid and 8\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8910 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and plasmid encoding stromal cell-derived factor 1 injected locally with injection of a gelatin scaffold mixed with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anal manometry, histology, immunohistochemistrym and morphometry were performed 8 weeks after treatment. Protein expression of cytokines CXCR4 and Myf5 was investigated 1 week after treatment (n = 6 per group). ANOVA was used, with p<0.0083 indicating significant differences for anal manometry and p<0.05 for all other statistical analysis.RESULTS: Eight weeks after treatment, all of the groups receiving the plasmid had significantly higher anal pressures than controls and more organized muscle architecture in the region of the defect. Animals receiving plasmid alone had significantly greater muscle in the defect (p = 0.03) than either animals with injury alone (p = 0.02) or those receiving the plasmid, cells, and scaffold (p = 0.03). Both smooth and skeletal muscles were regenerated significantly more after plasmid treatment. There were no significant differences in the protein levels of CXCR4 or Myf5.LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by its small sample size and because stromal cell-derived factor 1 was not blocked.CONCLUSIONS: A plasmid expressing stromal cell-derived factor 1 may be sufficient to repair an injured anal sphincter even long after the injury and in the absence of mesenchymal stem cell or scaffold treatments.

b'Mid-exponential cultures of two traditional biotechnological yeast species, winery Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the less ethanol tolerant bottom-fermenting brewery Saccharomyces pastorianus, were exposed to different concentrations of added ethanol (3, 5 and 8%) The degree of ethanol-induced cell stress was assessed by measuring the cellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), level of lipid peroxidation products, changes in cell lipid content and fatty acid profile. The resveratrol as an antioxidant was found to decrease the ethanol-induced rise of SOD activity and suppress the ethanol-induced decrease in cell lipids. A lower resveratrol concentration (0.5\xc2\xa0mg/l) even reduced the extent of lipid peroxidation in cells. Resveratrol also alleviated ethanol-induced changes in cell lipid composition in both species by strongly enhancing the proportion of saturated fatty acids and contributing thereby to membrane stabilization. Lower resveratrol concentrations could thus diminish the negative effects of ethanol stress on yeast cells and improve their physiological state. These effects may be utilized to enhance yeast vitality in high-ethanol-producing fermentations or to increase the number of yeast generations in brewery. labels: #Antioxidants#Ethanol#Fatty Acids#Lipid Metabolism#Lipid Peroxidation#Lipids#Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Stilbenes#Stress, Physiological#Superoxide Dismutase#Wine'
b'The crude extract isolated from the visceral mass of Anadara granosa, an intertidal bivalve mollusc was tested for inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria of the shrimp and fish viz. Vibrio harveyi and Staphylococcus aureus respectively by agar well diffusion and contact bioautography methods. Maximum inhibitory activity was shown against V. harveyi by methanol and chloroform (9:1) extract. Twelve fractions (1-12) could be separated from the crude extract through column chromatography. Five out of twelve fractions (7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) showed antibacterial activity and they were further run on column chromatography for purity. The fraction no. 9 showed highest antibacterial activity among the five and was subjected to NMR for the proton, C13and H1-H1correlation, IR and mass spectral analysis for structural elucidation.

b'Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used for wine fermentation and bio-fuels production. A S. cerevisiae strain Sc131 isolated from tropical fruit shows good fermentation properties and ethanol tolerance, exhibiting significant potential in Chinese bayberry wine fermentation. In this study, RNA-sequence and RT-qPCR was used to investigate the transcriptome profile of Sc131 in response to ethanol stress. Scanning Electron Microscopy were carried out to observe surface morphology of yeast cells. Totally, 937 genes were identified differential expressed, including 587 up-regulated and 350 down-regulated genes, after 4-h ethanol stress (10% v/v). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that, most genes involved in regulating filamentous growth or pseudohyphal growth were significantly up-regulated in response to ethanol stress. The complex protein quality control machineries, Hsp90/Hsp70 and Hsp104/Hsp70/Hsp40 based chaperone system combining with ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway were both activated to recognize and degrade misfolding proteins. Genes related to biosynthesis and metabolism of two well-known stress-responsive substances trehalose and ergosterol were generally up-regulated, while genes associated with amino acids biosynthesis and metabolism processes were differentially expressed. Moreover, thiamine was also important in response to ethanol stress. This research may promote the potential applications of Sc131 in the fermentation of Chinese bayberry wine. labels: #Amino Acids#Down-Regulation#Ergosterol#Ethanol#Fermentation#Gene Expression Profiling#Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex#Proteolysis#RNA#Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins#Stress, Physiological#Transcriptome#Trehalose#Ubiquitin#Up-Regulation#Wine'
b'Over the past four decades we have witnessed great progress and increasing pregnancy success rates with in\xc2\xa0vitro fertilization. However, this apparent success has been accompanied by the burden of multiple pregnancies. While efforts to reduce the number of embryos transferred have had a salutary impact on the incidence of high order multiple pregnancies, twin gestations have not diminished significantly. Thus, the search for a marker of embryo quality with the goal of selecting the single best embryo for transfer continues to be the major challenge facing our field. The four contributions in this Views and Reviews present several contemporary approaches, both invasive and non-invasive, for evaluating embryo viability. Each group makes the case that recent techniques, including time-lapse microscopy, biomechanical markers for oocytes and embryos, novel non-invasive methods of evaluating embryo metabolism and function as well as measurement of mitochondrial DNA, will allow the identification of the single best embryo for transfer. They describe several promising markers of embryo viability, although the goal of finding the "holy grail" of embryo selection has not yet been realized. labels: #Biomarkers#Blastocyst#Cell Survival#DNA, Mitochondrial#Embryo Implantation#Female#Fertility#Fertilization in Vitro#Genetic Markers#Humans#Infertility#Microscopy#Predictive Value of Tests#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Outcome#Pregnancy, Multiple#Single Embryo Transfer#Time-Lapse Imaging#Treatment Outcome'
b'Objectives: Transmission of polio poses a threat to military forces when deploying to regions where such viruses are endemic. US-born soldiers generally enter service with immunity resulting from childhood immunization against polio; moreover, new recruits are routinely vaccinated with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), supplemented based upon deployment circumstances. Given residual protection from childhood vaccination, risk-based vaccination may sufficiently protect troops from polio transmission.Methods: This analysis employed a mathematical system for polio transmission within military populations interacting with locals in a polio-endemic region to evaluate changes in vaccination policy.Results: Removal of blanket immunization had no effect on simulated polio incidence among deployed military populations when risk-based immunization was employed; however, when these individuals reintegrated with their base populations, risk of transmission to nondeployed personnel increased by 19%. In the absence of both blanket- and risk-based immunization, transmission to nondeployed populations increased by 25%. The overall number of new infections among nondeployed populations was negligible for both scenarios due to high childhood immunization rates, partial protection against transmission conferred by IPV, and low global disease incidence levels.Conclusion: Risk-based immunization driven by deployment to polio-endemic regions is sufficient to prevent transmission among both deployed and nondeployed US military populations. labels: #Computational Biology#Computer Simulation#Humans#Immunization Programs#Incidence#Mathematical Concepts#Military Personnel#Models, Biological#Poliomyelitis#Poliovirus Vaccine, Inactivated#Risk Factors#United States'
b'Besides the influenza virus (IV), several other viruses are responsible for influenza-like illness (ILI). Although human parechoviruses (HPeVs) and enteroviruses (EVs) may impact on ILI, limited data on their epidemiological characteristics are available. During seven consecutive winter seasons (from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017), within the framework of an influenza surveillance system (InfluNet), 593 respiratory swabs were collected from children \xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x80\x89years of age with ILIs. Molecular detection showed that 58.3\xe2\x80\x8a% of swabs were positive for at least one of the viruses under study: 46\xe2\x80\x8a% for IV, 13\xe2\x80\x8a% for EV and 5.4\xe2\x80\x8a% for HPeV. A single virus was identified in 51.3\xe2\x80\x8a% of samples while more than one virus was detected in 7\xe2\x80\x8a% of the samples. The risk of contracting IV was higher than the risk associated with EV, which in turn was higher than the risk of contracting HPeV. The risk of developing an IV infection was twofold greater in children>3\xe2\x80\x89years than in those \xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x80\x89years, who had higher risk of EV/HPeV infection. The frequency of EV/HPeV-positive swabs increased significantly during the 2016-2017 winter season compared to the previous six seasons. Sixteen EV genotypes were identified belonging to species A and B. HPeV-1 was the most frequently detected genotype, followed by -6 and -3. In this study, IV was mainly responsible for ILI, however EV and HPeV were also involved and particularly affected children \xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x80\x89years of age. Influenza surveillance samples could provide us with valuable insight into the epidemiological features of viruses involved in ILI. labels: #Child#Enterovirus#Genetic Variation#Humans#Italy#Molecular Epidemiology#Orthomyxoviridae#Parechovirus#Prevalence#Respiratory Tract Infections'
b"Objectives: Recent commercialization of methods for in situ hybridization using Z-pair probe/branched DNA amplification has led to increasing adoption of this technology for interrogating RNA expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Current practice for FFPE block storage is to maintain them at room temperature, often for many years.Methods: To examine the effects of block storage time on FFPE tissues using a number of RNA in situ probes with the Advanced Cellular Diagnostic's RNAscope assay.Results: We report marked reductions in signals after 5 years and significant reductions often after 1 year. Furthermore, storing unstained slides cut from recent cases (<1 year old) at -20\xc2\xb0C can preserve hybridization signals significantly better than storing the blocks at room temperature and cutting the slides fresh when needed.Conclusions: We submit that the standard practice of storing FFPE tissue blocks at room temperature should be reevaluated to better preserve RNA for in situ hybridization. labels: #Animals#Antigens, Neoplasm#Cold Temperature#Cryopreservation#Humans#In Situ Hybridization#Male#Mice#Paraffin Embedding#Prostatic Neoplasms#RNA#Tissue Array Analysis#Tissue Fixation"
b'Objectives: We sought to test recent guidelines for preserving immunoreactivity of precut slides, to quantify loss of immunoreactivity, and to determine potential for preservation by altering storage conditions.Methods: Precut slides from tissue microarrays were stored under one of several conditions: exposed to ambient air at room temperature, 4\xc2\xb0C, or -20\xc2\xb0C or in a vacuum-sealed container at room temperature, -20\xc2\xb0C, -80\xc2\xb0C, or with paraffin coating. At multiple intervals over 1 year, slides were stained with antibodies against p53, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, Ki-67, synaptophysin, and androgen receptor and evaluated.Results: Compared with time 0, the overall median percentage immunoreactivity was 66% at 6 months and 51% at 1 year. During the experiment, this was as low as 55% for precut slides stored in paraffin coating and up to 87% for those stored at -20\xc2\xb0C. Vacuum sealing was an effective preservative for some antibody targets and detrimental for others. Storage at -80\xc2\xb0C did not have added value.Conclusions: For precut slides, there is a time, storage condition, and antibody-dependent loss of immunoreactivity that could compromise analysis of prognostic, predictive, and diagnostic markers. Our findings support previous recommendations and suggest that the best storage conditions are at -20\xc2\xb0C, without paraffin coating or vacuum sealing. labels: #Epitopes#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Longitudinal Studies#Neoplasms#Paraffin Embedding#Prospective Studies#Specimen Handling#Time Factors#Tissue Array Analysis'
b'BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of operating room headgear in preventing airborne contamination has been called into question. We hypothesized that bouffant style hats would be as effective in preventing bacterial and particulate contamination in the operating room compared with disposable or cloth skull caps, and bouffant style hats would have similar permeability, particle penetration, and porosity compared with skull caps.STUDY DESIGN: Disposable bouffant and skull cap hats and newly laundered cloth skull caps were tested. A mock surgical procedure was used in a dynamic operating room environment. Airborne particulate and microbial contaminants were sampled. Hat fabric was tested for permeability, particle transmission, and pore sizes.RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between disposable bouffant and disposable skull caps with regard to particle or actively sampled microbial contamination. However, when compared with disposable skull caps, disposable bouffant hats did have significantly higher microbial shed at the sterile field, as measured by passive settle plate analysis (p<0.05). When compared with cloth skull caps, disposable bouffants yielded higher levels of 0.5 \xce\xbcm and 1.0 \xce\xbcm particles and significantly higher microbial shed detected with passive analysis. Fabric assessment determined that disposable bouffant hats had larger average and maximum pore sizes compared with cloth skull caps, and were significantly more permeable than either disposable or cloth skull caps.CONCLUSIONS: Disposable bouffant hats had greater permeability, penetration, and greater microbial shed, as assessed by passive microbial analysis compared with disposable skull caps. When compared with cloth skull caps, disposable bouffants yielded greater permeability, greater particulate contamination, and greater passive microbial shed. Disposable style bouffant hats should not be considered superior to skull caps in preventing airborne contamination in the operating room. labels: #Disposable Equipment#Environment, Controlled#Humans#Operating Rooms#Textiles'
b'With ongoing resistance problems against the marketed EGFR inhibitors having a quinazoline core scaffold there is a need for the development of novel inhibitors having a modified scaffold and, thus, expected lower EGFR resistance problems. An additional problem concerning EGFR inhibitor resistance is an observed heterodimerization of EGFR with PDGFR-\xce\xb2 that neutralises the sole inhibitor activity towards EGFR. We developed novel pyrimido[4,5-b]indoles with varied substitution patterns at the 4-anilino residue to evaluate their EGFR and PDGFR-\xce\xb2 inhibiting properties.

b'The \xce\xb2-class carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) from the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, BpsCA\xce\xb2, that is responsible for the tropical disease melioidosis was investigated for its activation with natural and non-natural amino acids and amines. Previously, the \xce\xb3-CA from this bacterium has been investigated with the same library of 19 amines/amino acids, which show very potent activating effects on both enzymes. The most effective BpsCA\xce\xb2 activators were L- and D-DOPA, L- and D-Trp, L-Tyr, 4-amino-L-Phe, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, 2-pyridyl-methylamine, 1-(2-aminoethyl)-piperazine and L-adrenaline with KAs of 0.9-27\xe2\x80\x89nM. Less effective activators were D-His, L- and D-Phe, D-Tyr, 2-(2-aminoethyl)pyridine and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-morpholine with KAs of 73\xe2\x80\x89nM-3.42\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M. The activation of CAs from bacteria, such as BpsCA\xce\xb3/\xce\xb2, has not been considered previously for possible biomedical applications. It would be of interest to perform studies in which bacteria are cultivated in the presence of CA activators, which may contribute to understanding processes connected with the virulence and colonization of the host by pathogenic bacteria. labels: #Amines#Amino Acids#Burkholderia pseudomallei#Carbonic Anhydrases#Molecular Structure'
b'In our present research, we synthesised new thiazolidine-2,4-diones (12-28). All the newly synthesised compounds were evaluated for antiproliferative and antibacterial activity. Antiproliferative evaluation was carried out using normal human skin fibroblasts and tumour cell lines: A549, HepG2, and MCF-7. The IC50values were determined for tested compounds revealing antiproliferative activity. Moreover, safety index (SI) was calculated. Among all tested derivatives, the compound 18 revealed the highest antiproliferative activity against human lung, breast, and liver cancer cells. More importantly, the derivative 18 showed meaningfully lower IC50values when compared to the reference substance, irinotecan, and relatively high SI values. Moreover, newly synthesised compounds were screened for the bacteria growth inhibition in vitro. According to our screening results, most active compound was the derivative 18 against Gram-positive bacteria.

Most of the compounds showed preferential inhibition towards MAO-B. Compound 4, (1-(1-(4-Bromophenyl)ethylidene)-4-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)semicarbazide) emerged as lead candidate (IC50\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.212\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M, SI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89331.04) against MAO-B; whereas compounds 21 1-(5-Bromo-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-4-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)semicarbazide (IC50\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.264\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M) and 17 1-((4-Chlorophenyl) (phenyl)methylene)-4-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)semicarbazide (IC50\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.024\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M) emerged as lead AChE and BuChE inhibitors respectively; with activity of compound 21 almost equivalent to tacrine. Kinetic studies indicated that compound 4 exhibited competitive and reversible MAO-B inhibition while compounds 21 and 17 showed mixed-type of AChE and BuChE inhibition respectively. Docking studies revealed that these compounds were well-accommodated within MAO-B and ChE active sites through stable hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions. This study revealed the requirement of small heteroaryl ring at amino terminal of semicarbazone template for preferential inhibition and selectivity towards MAO-B. Our results suggest that 5-nitrothiazole derived semicarbazones could be further exploited for its multi-targeted role in development of anti-neurodegenerative agents. [Formula: see text] A library of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole derived semicarbazones (4-21) was designed, synthesised and evaluated for in vitro MAO and ChE inhibitory activity. Compounds 4, 21 and 17 (shown) have emerged as lead MAO-B (IC50:0.212\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M, competitive and reversible), AChE (IC50:0.264\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M, mixed and reversible) and BuChE (IC50:0.024\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M, mixed and reversible) inhibitor respectively. SAR studies disclosed several structural aspects significant for potency and selectivity and indicated the role of size of aryl binding site in potency and selectivity towards MAO-B. Antioxidant activity and neurotoxicity screening results further suggested their multifunctional potential for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. labels: #Acetylcholinesterase#Animals#Binding Sites#Brain#Cholinesterase Inhibitors#Dose-Response Relationship, Drug#Drug Design#Mitochondria#Molecular Structure#Monoamine Oxidase#Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors#Particle Size#Rats#Rats, Wistar#Semicarbazones#Structure-Activity Relationship#Thiazoles'
b'Targeting EGFR has proven to be beneficial in the treatment of several types of solid tumours. So, a series of novel 2-(4-oxo-3-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo[g]quinazolin-2-ylthio)-N-substituted acetamide 5-19 were synthesised from the starting material 4-(2-mercapto-4-oxobenzo[g]quinazolin-3(4H)-yl) benzenesulfonamide 4, to be evaluated as dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. The target compounds 5-19, were screened for their cytotoxic activity against A549 lung cancer cell line. The percentage inhibition of EGFR enzyme was measured and compared with erlotinib as the reference drug. Compounds 6, 8, 10, and 16 showed excellent EGFR inhibitory activity and were further selected for screening as dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. The four selected compounds showed IC50ranging from 0.009 to 0.026\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M for EGFR and 0.021 to 0.069\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5M for the HER2 enzyme.

b'The \xce\xb2-carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) from the pathogenic bacterium Clostridium perfringens (CpeCA) was recently characterised kinetically and for its anion inhibition profile. In the search of effective CpeCA inhibitors, possibly useful to inhibit the growth/pathogenicity of this bacterium, we report here an inhibition study of this enzyme with a panel of aromatic, heterocyclic and sugar sulphonamides/sulphamates. Some sulphonamides, such as acetazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, sulthiame and 4-(2-hydroxymethyl-4-nitrophenyl-sulphonamido)ethylbenzenesulphonamide were effective CpeCA inhibitors, with KIs in the range of 37.4-71.6\xe2\x80\x89nM. Zonisamide and saccharin were the least effective such inhibitors, whereas many other aromatic and heterocyclic sulphonamides were moderate - weak inhibitors with KIs ranging between 113 and 8755\xe2\x80\x89nM. Thus, this study provides the basis for developing better clostridial enzyme inhibitors with potential as antiinfectives with a new mechanism of action. labels: #Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors#Carbonic Anhydrases#Clostridium perfringens#Dose-Response Relationship, Drug#Molecular Structure#Structure-Activity Relationship#Sulfonamides'
b'BACKGROUND: Post-market surveillance is needed to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness and safety of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved devices.OBJECTIVES: The authors examined the commercial experience with transcatheter mitral valve repair for the treatment of mitral regurgitation.METHODS: Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgery/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry on patients commercially treated with transcatheter mitral valve repair were analyzed. The study population consisted of 2,952 patients treated at 145 hospitals between November 2013 and September 2015. In 1,867 patients, data were linked to patient-specific Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrative claims for analyses.RESULTS: The median age was 82 years (55.8% men), with a median Society of Thoracic Surgery predicted risk of mortality of 6.1% (interquartile range: 3.7% to 9.9%) and 9.2% (interquartile range: 6.0% to 14.1%) for mitral repair and replacement, respectively. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 2.7%. Acute procedure success occurred in 91.8%. Among the patients with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services linkage data, the mortality at 30\xc2\xa0days and at 1 year was 5.2% and 25.8%, respectively, and repeat hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year occurred in 20.2%. Variables associated with mortality or rehospitalization for heart failure after multivariate adjustment were increasing age, lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, worse post-procedural mitral regurgitation, moderate or severe lung disease, dialysis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that commercial transcatheter mitral valve repair is being performed in the\xc2\xa0United States with acute effectiveness and safety.

b'BACKGROUND: Very late scaffold thrombosis (VLScT) occurs more frequently after bioresorbable scaffold (Absorb BVS\xc2\xa01.1, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) implantation than with metallic everolimus-eluting stents.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate mechanisms underlying VLScT as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT).METHODS: The INVEST (Independent OCT Registry on Very Late Bioresorbable Scaffold Thrombosis) registry is an international consortium of investigators who used OCT to examine patients with VLScT.RESULTS: Between June 2013 and May 2017, 36 patients with 38 lesions who had VLScT underwent OCT at 19 centers. VLScT occurred at a median of 20\xc2\xa0months (interquartile range: 16 to 27\xc2\xa0months) after implantation. At the time of VLScT, 83% of patients received aspirin monotherapy and 17% received dual-antiplatelet therapy. The mechanisms underlying VLScT were (in descending order) scaffold discontinuity (42.1%), malapposition (18.4%), neoatherosclerosis (18.4%), underexpansion or scaffold recoil (10.5%), uncovered struts (5.3%), and edge-related disease progression (2.6%). Discontinuity (odds ratio [OR]: 110; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.5 to 173; p\xc2\xa0<0.001), malapposed struts (OR: 17.0; 95% CI: 14.8 to 19.7; p\xc2\xa0<0.001), and uncovered struts (OR: 7.3; 95% CI: 6.2 to 8.8; p\xc2\xa0<0.001) were more frequent in the thrombosed than the nonthrombosed scaffold regions. In 2 of 16 patients with scaffold discontinuity, intercurrent OCT before VLScT provided evidence of circularly apposed scaffold struts with minimal tissue coverage.CONCLUSIONS: The leading mechanism underlying VLScT was scaffold discontinuity, which suggests an unfavorable resorption-related process, followed by malapposition and neoatherosclerosis. It remains to be determined whether modifications in scaffold design and optimized implantation can mitigate the risk of VLScT.

b'BACKGROUND: Coronary vasomotor dysfunction is an important mechanism for angina in patients with unobstructed coronary arteries.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine sex differences in the prevalence and clinical presentation of vasomotor dysfunction in a European population and to examine sex differences in the dose of acetylcholine leading to a positive acetylcholine provocation test (ACH test).METHODS: Between 2007 and 2014, we included 1,379 consecutive patients with stable angina, unobstructed coronaries and ACH test performed for epicardial vasospasm or coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) due to microvascular spasm. The predictive value of sex, risk factors, symptoms, and noninvasive test results was analyzed by means of logistic regression.RESULTS: The mean patient age was 62 years, and 42% were male. There were 813 patients (59%) with a pathological ACH test, 33% for CMD and 26% for epicardial vasospasm. A pathological test was more common in females (70% vs. 43%; p\xc2\xa0<0.001). In a multivariable logistic regression model the sex difference was statistically significant with a female-male odds ratio for CMD and epicardial vasospasm of 4.2 (95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 5.5; p\xc2\xa0<0.001) and 2.3\xc2\xa0(95% confidence interval: 1.7 to 3.1; p\xc2\xa0<0.001), respectively. Effort-related symptoms, but neither risk factors nor noninvasive stress tests, contributed to predicting a pathological test. Female patients were more sensitive to acetylcholine with vasomotor dysfunction occurring at lower ACH doses compared with male patients.CONCLUSIONS: Vasomotor dysfunction is frequent in patients with angina and unobstructed coronaries in a European population. Female patients have a higher prevalence of vasomotor dysfunction (especially CMD) compared with male\xc2\xa0patients. A pathological ACH test was observed at lower ACH doses in women compared with men. labels: #Acetylcholine#Aged#Angina Pectoris#Coronary Vasospasm#Coronary Vessels#Dose-Response Relationship, Drug#Europe#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Sex Characteristics#Vasodilator Agents#Vasomotor System'
b'BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic myocarditis (EM) is an acute life-threatening inflammatory disease of the heart. Neither large case series nor clinical trials on this specific myocarditis have been reported.OBJECTIVES: Based on a systematic revision of all published histologically proven cases, this study aimed to describe the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of EM.METHODS: The study screened 443 manuscripts in MEDLINE and EMBASE on cases of EM published until June 2017. The\xc2\xa0authors identified 264 patients and included in the main analysis 179 patients admitted to hospital with histologically\xc2\xa0proven EM.RESULTS: Median age was 41 years (interquartile range: 27 to 53 years) with similar prevalence in both sexes; pediatric\xc2\xa0cases (\xe2\x89\xa416 years of age) accounted for 10.1%. The main symptom at presentation was dyspnea (59.4%), with\xc2\xa0peripheral eosinophilia observed in 75.9%. Median left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation was 35% (interquartile range: 25% to 50%). The disorders most frequently associated with EM were hypersensitivity and\xc2\xa0eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which accounted for 34.1% and 12.8% of cases, respectively, whereas\xc2\xa0idiopathic or undefined forms accounted for 35.7% of cases. Steroids were administered in 77.7% of patients. A\xc2\xa0temporary mechanical circulatory support (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa030) was instituted in 16.8% of patients. In-hospital death was 22.3%\xc2\xa0(n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa040), with the highest occurrence in the hypersensitivity form (36.1%; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.026).CONCLUSIONS: EM has a poor prognosis during the acute phase, despite a publication bias that could have led to an\xc2\xa0overestimation of mortality. Associated conditions are identified in approximately 65% of cases.

b'BACKGROUND: Several clinical studies have evaluated the association between ST2 and outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). However, little is known about the predictive value of frequently measured ST2 levels in patients with acute HF.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe the prognostic value of baseline and repeated ST2 measurements in patients\xc2\xa0with acute HF.METHODS: In the TRIUMPH (Translational Initiative on Unique and novel strategies for Management of Patients with Heart failure) clinical cohort study, 496 patients with acute HF were enrolled in 14 hospitals in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2014. Repeated blood samples (7) were drawn during 1-year follow-up. ST2 and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were measured in a central laboratory. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization. Associations between repeated biomarker measurements and the primary endpoint were assessed using a joint model.RESULTS: Median age was 74 years, and 37% of patients were women. The primary endpoint was reached in 188 patients\xc2\xa0(40%) during a median follow-up of 325\xc2\xa0days (interquartile range: 85 to 401). The median baseline ST2 level was 71\xc2\xa0ng/ml (interquartile range: 46 to 102). After adjustment for clinical factors and NT-proBNP, baseline ST2 was associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint, and the hazard ratio per 1 SD increase of the baseline ST2 level (on the log2scale) was 1.30 (95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.56; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.005). When repeated measurements were taken into account, the adjusted hazard ratio per 1 SD increase of the ST2 level (on the log2scale) during follow-up increased to 1.85 (95%\xc2\xa0confidence interval: 1.02 to 3.33; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.044), adjusted for clinical factors and repeated measurements\xc2\xa0of NT-proBNP. Furthermore, ST2 levels appeared to elevate several weeks before the time of the primary\xc2\xa0endpoint.CONCLUSIONS: Repeated ST2 measurements appeared to be a strong predictor of outcome in patients with acute HF, independent of repeatedly measured NT-proBNP. Hence ST2 may be helpful in clinical practice for prognostication and\xc2\xa0treatment monitoring.

b'BACKGROUND: Recently, a new ablation strategy for atrial fibrillation has emerged, which involves the identification of rotors (ie, local drivers) followed by the localized targeting of their core region by ablation. However, this concept has been subject to debate because the mode of arrhythmia termination remains poorly understood, as dedicated models and research tools are lacking. We took a unique optogenetic approach to induce and locally target a rotor in atrial monolayers.METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocyte monolayers expressing a depolarizing light-gated ion channel (Ca2+-translocating channelrhodopsin) were subjected to patterned illumination to induce single, stable, and centralized rotors by optical S1-S2 cross-field stimulation. Next, the core region of these rotors was specifically and precisely targeted by light to induce local conduction blocks of circular or linear shapes. Conduction blocks crossing the core region, but not reaching any unexcitable boundary, did not lead to termination. Instead, electric waves started to propagate along the circumference of block, thereby maintaining reentrant activity, although of lower frequency. If, however, core-spanning lines of block reached at least 1 unexcitable boundary, reentrant activity was consistently terminated by wave collision. Lines of block away from the core region resulted merely in rotor destabilization (ie, drifting).CONCLUSIONS: Localized optogenetic targeting of rotors in atrial monolayers could lead to both stabilization and destabilization of reentrant activity. For termination, however, a line of block is required reaching from the core region to at least 1 unexcitable boundary. These findings may improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in rotor-guided ablation. labels: #Action Potentials#Animals#Animals, Newborn#Atrial Fibrillation#Calcium Channels#Catheter Ablation#Cells, Cultured#Heart Atria#Heart Rate#Myocytes, Cardiac#Optogenetics#Rats, Wistar#Rhodopsin#Time Factors#Transfection'
b'Oral squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most malignant tumors with high mortality rate worldwide. Biomarker discovery is critical for early diagnosis and precision treatment of this disease. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules which often regulate essential biological processes and are good candidates for biomarkers. By integrative analysis of both the cancer-associated gene expression data and microRNA-mRNA network, miR-148b-3p, miR-629-3p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-142-3p were screened as novel diagnostic biomarkers for oral squamous cell carcinoma based on their unique regulatory abilities in the network structure of the conditional microRNA-mRNA network and their important functions. These findings were confirmed by literature verification and functional enrichment analysis. Future experimental validation is expected for the further investigation of their molecular mechanisms. labels: #Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Squamous Cell#Computational Biology#Gene Expression Profiling#Gene Regulatory Networks#Humans#MicroRNAs#Models, Genetic#Mouth Neoplasms#RNA, Messenger'
b'The introduction of forensic autosomal DNA profiles was controversial, but the problems were successfully addressed, and DNA profiling has gone on to revolutionise forensic science. Y-chromosome profiles are valuable when there is a mixture of male-source and female-source DNA, and interest centres on the identity of the male source(s) of the DNA. The problem of evaluating evidential weight is even more challenging for Y profiles than for autosomal profiles. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but they fail to deal adequately with the fact that men with matching Y-profiles are related in extended patrilineal clans, many of which may not be represented in available databases. The higher mutation rates of modern profiling kits have led to increased discriminatory power but they have also exacerbated the problem of fairly conveying evidential value. Because the relevant population is difficult to define, yet the number of matching relatives is fixed as population size varies, it is typically infeasible to derive population-based match probabilities relevant to a specific crime. We propose a conceptually simple solution, based on a simulation model and software to approximate the distribution of the number of males with a matching Y profile. We show that this distribution is robust to different values for the variance in reproductive success and the population growth rate. We also use importance sampling reweighting to derive the distribution of the number of matching males conditional on a database frequency, finding that this conditioning typically has only a modest impact. We illustrate the use of our approach to quantify the value of Y profile evidence for a court in a way that is both scientifically valid and easily comprehensible by a judge or juror. labels: #Chromosomes, Human, Y#DNA#DNA Fingerprinting#Forensic Genetics#Humans#Male#Probability#Reproduction#Software'
b'Short tandem repeats (STRs) are hyper-mutable sequences in the human genome. They are often used in forensics and population genetics and are also the underlying cause of many genetic diseases. There are challenges associated with accurately determining the length polymorphism of STR loci in the genome by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In particular, accurate detection of pathological STR expansion is limited by the sequence read length during whole-genome analysis. We developed TREDPARSE, a software package that incorporates various cues from read alignment and paired-end distance distribution, as well as a sequence stutter model, in a probabilistic framework to infer repeat sizes for genetic loci, and we used this software to infer repeat sizes for 30 known disease loci. Using simulated data, we show that TREDPARSE outperforms other available software. We sampled the full genome sequences of 12,632 individuals to an average read depth of approximately 30\xc3\x97 to 40\xc3\x97 with Illumina HiSeq X. We identified 138 individuals with risk alleles at 15 STR disease loci. We validated a representative subset of the samples (n = 19) by Sanger and by Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we validated the STR calls against known allele sizes in a set of GeT-RM reference cell-line materials (n = 6). Several STR loci that are entirely guanine or cytosines (G or C) have insufficient read evidence for inference and therefore could not be assayed precisely by TREDPARSE. TREDPARSE extends the limit of STR size detection beyond the physical sequence read length. This extension is critical because many of the disease risk cutoffs are close to or beyond the short sequence read length of 100 to 150 bases. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Alleles#Child#Female#Genetics, Population#Genome, Human#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Male#Microsatellite Repeats#Middle Aged#Polymorphism, Genetic#Sequence Analysis, DNA#Software'
b'Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is a group of conditions characterized by the co-occurrence of epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID), typically with developmental plateauing or regression associated with frequent epileptiform activity. The cause of DEE remains unknown in the majority of cases. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 197 individuals with unexplained DEE and pharmaco-resistant seizures and in their unaffected parents. We focused our attention on de novo mutations (DNMs) and identified candidate genes containing such variants. We sought to identify additional subjects with DNMs in these genes by performing targeted sequencing in another series of individuals with DEE and by mining various sequencing datasets. We also performed meta-analyses to document enrichment of DNMs in candidate genes by leveraging our WGS dataset with those of several DEE and ID series. By combining these strategies, we were able to provide a causal link between DEE and the following genes: NTRK2, GABRB2, CLTC, DHDDS, NUS1, RAB11A, GABBR2, and SNAP25. Overall, we established a molecular diagnosis in 63/197 (32%) individuals in our WGS series. The main cause of DEE in these individuals was de novo point mutations (53/63 solved cases), followed by inherited mutations (6/63 solved cases) and de novo CNVs (4/63 solved cases). De novo missense variants explained a larger proportion of individuals in our series than in other series that were primarily ascertained because of ID. Moreover, these DNMs were more frequently recurrent than those identified in ID series. These observations indicate that the genetic landscape of DEE might be different from that of ID without epilepsy. labels: #Brain Diseases#Child#Child, Preschool#Epilepsy#Female#Genome, Human#Genome-Wide Association Study#Humans#Intellectual Disability#Male#Mutation#Recurrence#Seizures'
b'DHX30 is a member of the family of DExH-box helicases, which use ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA secondary structures. Here we identified six different de novo missense mutations in DHX30 in twelve unrelated individuals affected by global developmental delay (GDD), intellectual disability (ID), severe speech impairment and gait abnormalities. While four mutations are recurrent, two are unique with one affecting the codon of one recurrent mutation. All amino acid changes are located within highly conserved helicase motifs and were found to either impair ATPase activity or RNA recognition in different in\xc2\xa0vitro assays. Moreover, protein variants exhibit an increased propensity to trigger stress granule (SG) formation resulting in global translation inhibition. Thus, our findings highlight the prominent role of translation control in development and function of the central nervous system and also provide molecular insight into how DHX30 dysfunction might cause a neurodevelopmental disorder. labels: #Adenosine Triphosphatases#Adolescent#Amino Acids#Cell Line#Cell Line, Tumor#Central Nervous System#Child#Child, Preschool#Developmental Disabilities#Female#HEK293 Cells#Humans#Intellectual Disability#Male#Mutation, Missense#RNA#RNA Helicases'
b'The transatlantic slave trade was the largest forced migration in world history. However, the origins of the enslaved Africans and their admixture dynamics remain unclear. To investigate the demographic history of African-descendant Marron populations, we generated genome-wide data (4.3 million markers) from 107 individuals from three African-descendant populations in South America, as well as 124 individuals from six west African populations. Throughout the Americas, thousands of enslaved Africans managed to escape captivity and establish lasting communities, such as the Noir Marron. We find that this population has the highest proportion of African ancestry (\xe2\x88\xbc98%) of any African-descendant population analyzed to date, presumably because of centuries of genetic isolation. By contrast, African-descendant populations in Brazil and Colombia harbor substantially more European and Native American ancestry as a result of their complex admixture histories. Using ancestry tract-length analysis, we detect different dates for the European admixture events in the African-Colombian (1749 CE; confidence interval [CI]: 1737-1764) and African-Brazilian (1796 CE; CI: 1789-1804) populations in our dataset, consistent with the historically attested earlier influx of Africans into Colombia. Furthermore, we find evidence for sex-specific admixture patterns, resulting from predominantly European paternal gene flow. Finally, we detect strong genetic links between the African-descendant populations and specific source populations in Africa on the basis of haplotype sharing patterns. Although the Noir Marron and African-Colombians show stronger affinities with African populations from the Bight of Benin and the Gold Coast, the African-Brazilian population from Rio de Janeiro has greater genetic affinity with Bantu-speaking populations from the Bight of Biafra and west central Africa. labels: #Africa#African Continental Ancestry Group#Brazil#European Continental Ancestry Group#Female#French Guiana#Gene Flow#Genetics, Population#Genome-Wide Association Study#Haplotypes#Hispanic Americans#Humans#Male#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Suriname'
b'Although genetic correlations between complex traits provide valuable insights into epidemiological and etiological studies, a precise quantification of which genomic regions disproportionately contribute to the genome-wide correlation is currently lacking. Here, we introduce \xcf\x81-HESS, a technique to quantify the correlation between pairs of traits due to genetic variation at a small region in the genome. Our approach requires GWAS summary data only and makes no distributional assumption on the causal variant effect sizes while accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and overlapping GWAS samples. We analyzed large-scale GWAS summary data across 36 quantitative traits, and identified 25 genomic regions that contribute significantly to the genetic correlation among these traits. Notably, we find 6 genomic regions that contribute to the genetic correlation of 10 pairs of traits that show negligible genome-wide correlation, further showcasing the power of local genetic correlation analyses. Finally, we report the distribution of local genetic correlations across the genome for 55 pairs of traits that show putative causal relationships. labels: #Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Genetic Variation#Genome-Wide Association Study#Genomics#Humans#Linkage Disequilibrium#Models, Genetic#Phenotype#Quantitative Trait Loci'
b'The increase in red blood cell mass (polycythemia) due to the reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) of residence at high altitude or other conditions is generally thought to be beneficial in terms of increasing tissue oxygen supply. However, the extreme polycythemia and accompanying increased mortality due to heart failure in chronic mountain sickness most likely reduces fitness. Tibetan highlanders have adapted to high altitude, possibly in part via the selection of genetic variants associated with reduced polycythemic response to hypoxia. In contrast, high-altitude-adapted Quechua- and Aymara-speaking inhabitants of the Andean Altiplano are not protected from high-altitude polycythemia in the same way, yet they exhibit other adaptive features for which the genetic underpinnings remain obscure. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to scan high-altitude Andeans for signals of selection. The genes showing the strongest evidence of selection-including BRINP3, NOS2, and TBX5-are associated with cardiovascular development and function but are not in the response-to-hypoxia pathway. Using association mapping, we demonstrated that the haplotypes under selection are associated with phenotypic variations related to cardiovascular health. We hypothesize that selection in response to hypoxia in Andeans could have vascular effects and could serve to mitigate the deleterious effects of polycythemia rather than reduce polycythemia itself. labels: #Adaptation, Physiological#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Altitude#Altitude Sickness#Cardiovascular System#Female#Genome-Wide Association Study#Haplotypes#Heart Failure#Humans#Hypoxia#Male#Middle Aged#Polycythemia#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Selection, Genetic'
b'Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) is one of the first proteins shown to be essential for normal learning and synaptic plasticity in mice, but its requirement for human brain development has not yet been established. Through a multi-center collaborative study based on a whole-exome sequencing approach, we identified 19 exceedingly rare de novo CAMK2A or CAMK2B variants in 24 unrelated individuals with intellectual disability. Variants were assessed for their effect on CAMK2 function and on neuronal migration. For both CAMK2A and CAMK2B, we identified mutations that decreased or increased CAMK2 auto-phosphorylation at Thr286/Thr287. We further found that all mutations affecting auto-phosphorylation also affected neuronal migration, highlighting the importance of tightly regulated CAMK2 auto-phosphorylation in neuronal function and neurodevelopment.

We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish. The significance of the association, which was p = 2.0\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97 10-5for novel LOF, increased to p = 4.1\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97 10-6for LOF and deleterious missense variants combined, and augmented further after accounting for segregation and de novo inheritance of rare variants (joint p = 2.3\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97 10-7). Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 disruption or knockdown of greb1l in zebrafish caused specific pronephric defects, which were rescued by wild-type human GREB1L mRNA, but not mRNA containing alleles identified in case subjects. Together, our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of kidney malformations in humans, presents multiple candidates, and identifies SLIT3 and GREB1L as genes implicated in the pathogenesis of RHD. labels: #Alleles#Animals#Case-Control Studies#Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats#Congenital Abnormalities#Exome#Female#Genetic Heterogeneity#Genome-Wide Association Study#Genotype#Heredity#Homozygote#Humans#Kidney#Kidney Diseases#Male#Membrane Proteins#Mice#Mutation#Neoplasm Proteins#Phenotype#RNA, Long Noncoding#Urinary Tract#Urogenital Abnormalities#Zebrafish'
b'Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) constitute a major cause of chronic kidney disease in children and 20% of prenatally detected anomalies. CAKUT encompass a spectrum of developmental kidney defects, including renal agenesis, hypoplasia, and cystic and non-cystic dysplasia. More than 50 genes have been reported as mutated in CAKUT-affected case subjects. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to bilateral kidney agenesis (BKA) remain largely elusive. Whole-exome or targeted exome sequencing of 183 unrelated familial and/or severe CAKUT-affected case subjects, including 54 fetuses with BKA, led to the identification of 16 heterozygous variants in GREB1L (growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1-like), a gene reported as a target of retinoic acid signaling. Four loss-of-function and 12 damaging missense variants, 14 being absent from GnomAD, were identified. Twelve of them were present in familial or simplex BKA-affected case subjects. Female BKA-affected fetuses also displayed uterus agenesis. We demonstrated a significant association between GREB1L variants and BKA. By in situ hybridization, we showed expression of Greb1l in the nephrogenic zone in developing mouse kidney. We generated a Greb1l knock-out mouse model by CRISPR-Cas9. Analysis at E13.5 revealed lack of kidneys and genital tract anomalies in male and female Greb1l-/-embryos and a slight decrease in ureteric bud branching in Greb1l+/-embryos. We showed that Greb1l invalidation in mIMCD3 cells affected tubulomorphogenesis in 3D-collagen culture, a phenotype rescued by expression of the wild-type human protein. This demonstrates that GREB1L plays a major role in early metanephros and genital development in mice and humans. labels: #Animals#Child#Congenital Abnormalities#Exome#Female#Fetus#Heterozygote#Humans#Kidney#Kidney Diseases#Male#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mice, Knockout#Mutation#Neoplasm Proteins#Phenotype#Proteins#Urinary Tract#Urogenital Abnormalities'
b'Fibronectin is a master organizer of extracellular matrices (ECMs) and promotes the assembly of collagens, fibrillin-1, and other proteins. It is also known to play roles in skeletal tissues through its secretion by osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and mesenchymal cells. Spondylometaphyseal dysplasias (SMDs) comprise a diverse group of skeletal dysplasias and often manifest as short stature, growth-plate irregularities, and vertebral anomalies, such as scoliosis. By comparing the exomes of individuals with SMD with the radiographic appearance of "corner fractures" at metaphyses, we identified three individuals with fibronectin (FN1) variants affecting highly conserved residues. Furthermore, using matching tools and the SkelDys emailing list, we identified other individuals with de novo\xc2\xa0FN1 variants and a similar phenotype. The severe scoliosis in most individuals and rare developmental coxa vara distinguish individuals with FN1 mutations from those with classical Sutcliffe-type SMD. To study functional consequences of these FN1 mutations on the protein level, we introduced three disease-associated missense variants (p.Cys87Phe [c.260G>T], p.Tyr240Asp [c.718T>G], and p.Cys260Gly [c.778T>G]) into a recombinant secreted N-terminal 70\xc2\xa0kDa fragment (rF70K) and the full-length fibronectin (rFN). The wild-type rF70K and rFN were secreted into the culture medium, whereas all mutant proteins were either not secreted or secreted at significantly lower amounts. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated increased intracellular retention of the mutant proteins. In summary, FN1 mutations that cause defective fibronectin secretion are found in SMD, and we thus provide additional evidence for a critical function of fibronectin in cartilage and bone. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Bone Diseases, Developmental#Bone and Bones#Cartilage#Child#Child, Preschool#Exome#Female#Fibronectins#Fractures, Bone#Humans#Male#Mutation#Osteochondrodysplasias#Phenotype#Scoliosis'
b"Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome (GCMS) is a dysmorphic syndrome characterized by coronal craniosynostosis and severe midface hypoplasia, body and facial hypertrichosis, microphthalmia, short stature, and short distal phalanges. Variable lipoatrophy and cutis laxa are the basis for a progeroid appearance. Using exome and genome sequencing, we identified the recurrent de novo mutations c.650G>A (p.Arg217His) and c.649C>T (p.Arg217Cys) in SLC25A24 in five unrelated girls diagnosed with GCMS. Two of the girls had pronounced neonatal progeroid features and were initially diagnosed with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. SLC25A24 encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane ATP-Mg/Picarrier. In fibroblasts from affected individuals, the mutated SLC25A24 showed normal stability. In contrast to control cells, the probands' cells showed mitochondrial swelling, which was exacerbated upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The same effect was observed after overexpression of the mutant cDNA. Under normal culture conditions, the mitochondrial membrane potential of the probands' fibroblasts was intact, whereas ATP content in the mitochondrial matrix was lower than that in control cells. However, upon H2O2exposure, the membrane potential was significantly elevated in cells harboring the mutated SLC25A24. No reduction of mitochondrial DNA copy number was observed. These findings demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction with increased sensitivity to oxidative stress is due to the SLC25A24 mutations. Our results suggest that the SLC25A24 mutations induce a gain of pathological function and link mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pitransport to the development of skeletal and connective tissue. labels: #Abnormalities, Multiple#Adenosine Triphosphate#Adolescent#Antiporters#Calcium-Binding Proteins#Child#Child, Preschool#Craniofacial Abnormalities#Craniosynostoses#Cutis Laxa#DNA, Mitochondrial#Ductus Arteriosus, Patent#Exome#Female#Fetal Growth Retardation#Fibroblasts#Humans#Hydrogen Peroxide#Hypertrichosis#Infant#Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial#Mitochondria#Mitochondrial Proteins#Mutation#Oxidative Stress#Progeria"
b'A series of simplex cases have been reported under various diagnoses sharing early aging, especially evident in congenitally decreased subcutaneous fat tissue and sparse hair, bone dysplasia of the skull and fingers, a distinctive facial gestalt, and prenatal and postnatal growth retardation. For historical reasons, we suggest naming the entity Fontaine syndrome. Exome sequencing of four unrelated affected individuals showed that all carried the de novo missense variant c.649C>T (p.Arg217Cys) or c.650G>A (p.Arg217His) in SLC25A24, a solute carrier 25 family member coding for calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein (SCaMC-1, also known as SLC25A24). SLC25A24 allows an electro-neutral and reversible exchange of ATP-Mg and phosphate between the cytosol and mitochondria, which is required for maintaining optimal adenine nucleotide levels in the mitochondrial matrix. Molecular dynamic simulation studies predict that p.Arg217Cys and p.Arg217His narrow the substrate cavity of the protein and disrupt transporter dynamics. SLC25A24-mutant fibroblasts and cells expressing p.Arg217Cys or p.Arg217His variants showed altered mitochondrial morphology, a decreased proliferation rate, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ATP-linked mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The results suggest that the SLC25A24 mutations lead to impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis and cause hyperpolarization and increased proton leak in association with an impaired energy metabolism. Our findings identify SLC25A24 mutations affecting codon 217 as the underlying genetic cause of human progeroid Fontaine syndrome. labels: #Adenine#Adenosine Triphosphate#Aging#Antiporters#Bone Diseases, Developmental#Calcium-Binding Proteins#Cytosol#Female#Fetal Death#Fibroblasts#Humans#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Male#Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial#Mitochondria#Mitochondrial Proteins#Molecular Dynamics Simulation#Mutation#Oxygen#Phosphates#Syndrome'
b'Approximately one in every 200 mammalian proteins is anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. These proteins play important roles notably in neurological development and function. To date, more than 20 genes have been implicated in the biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins. GPAA1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment 1) is an essential component of the transamidase complex along with PIGK, PIGS, PIGT, and PIGU (phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis classes K, S, T, and U, respectively). This complex orchestrates the attachment of the GPI anchor to the C terminus of precursor proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we report bi-allelic mutations in GPAA1 in ten individuals from five families. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified two frameshift mutations (c.981_993del [p.Gln327Hisfs\xe2\x88\x97102] and c.920delG [p.Gly307Alafs\xe2\x88\x9711]), one intronic splicing mutation (c.1164+5C>T), and six missense mutations (c.152C>T [p.Ser51Leu], c.160_161delinsAA [p.Ala54Asn], c.527G>C [p.Trp176Ser], c.869T>C [p.Leu290Pro], c.872T>C [p.Leu291Pro], and c.1165G>C [p.Ala389Pro]). Most individuals presented with global developmental delay, hypotonia, early-onset seizures, cerebellar atrophy, and osteopenia. The splicing mutation was found to decrease GPAA1 mRNA. Moreover, flow-cytometry analysis of five available individual samples showed that several GPI-anchored proteins had decreased cell-surface abundance in leukocytes (FLAER, CD16, and CD59) or fibroblasts (CD73 and CD109). Transduction of fibroblasts with a lentivirus encoding the wild-type protein partially rescued the deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins. These findings highlight the role of the transamidase complex in the development and function of the cerebellum and the skeletal system. labels: #Acyltransferases#Adolescent#Adult#Alleles#Atrophy#Bone Diseases, Metabolic#Cerebellum#Child#Child, Preschool#Developmental Disabilities#Epilepsy#Exome#Female#Fibroblasts#Glycosylphosphatidylinositols#Humans#Male#Membrane Glycoproteins#Muscle Hypotonia#Mutation#Pedigree#RNA, Messenger#Seizures'
b'INTRODUCTION: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is featured with the biological properties of strong aggressive behaviors, rapid disease progression, high risk of recurrence and metastasis, and low disease free survival. Patients with this tumor are insensitive to the endocrine therapy and target treatment for HER-2; therefore, chemotherapy is often used as routine treatment in clinical. Because of the fact that a considerable number of patients seek for Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) treatment after operation and chemotherapy and (or) radiotherapy, it is thus need to evaluate the correlation between Chinese herbal medicine treatment and prognosis.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicenter, prospective cohort study started in March 2016 in Beijing. A simple of 220 participants diagnosed with TNBC were recruited from nine hospitals and are followed up every 3 to 6 months till March 2020. Detailed information of participants includes personal information, history of cancer, quality of life, symptoms of traditional Chinese medicine and fatigue status is taken face-to-face at baseline.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval from the Research Ethical Committee of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine affiliated to Capital Medical University (No.2016BL-014-01).

b'The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors of wound infection after open reduction and internal fixation of calcaneal fractures.In all, 299 patients with 318 calcaneal fractures who underwent open reduction and internal fixation by a single surgeon were grouped according to different outcomes. We gathered the data on each patient including sex, age, injury mechanism, body mass index (BMI), time to operation, fracture type, associated injuries, treatment course, tourniquet time, blood loss, bone graft (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no), smoking history, and complications. Univariate analysis and multivariable analysis were used to determine the association between risk factors and wound infection.Patients who met the entry criteria included 267 males and 32 females with a mean age of 38.6 years. Among them, 5.3% (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a17) suffered wound infection, and all of the wounds healed after different treatments. According to the univariate analysis, the patients who developed wound infections were active smokers, more obese (higher BMI), had a longer time from injury to operation, and longer tourniquet time. Multivariate analysis indicated that a higher BMI, delayed operation, and active smoking were independent risk factors for wound infection after open reduction and internal fixation of calcaneal fractures.Patients with calcaneal fractures who were smokers and had a higher BMI had a high risk of wound infections. We suggested that surgeons wait to operate until swellings of the injured foot improved, and we also suggested the operation should be within 14 days after the injury. labels: #Adult#Body Mass Index#Calcaneus#Female#Fracture Fixation, Internal#Fractures, Bone#Humans#Male#Multivariate Analysis#Obesity#Open Fracture Reduction#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Smoking#Surgical Wound Infection#Time Factors#Time-to-Treatment#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: This randomized clinical trial (October 2012-December 2013) compared extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and a vacuum erectile device (VED) for management of erectile dysfunction (ED).METHODS: Consecutive Chinese patients (20-55 years) with ED, abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR), and international index of erectile function-5 items (IIEF-5) score<22 were randomized to receive ESWT or VED (twice weekly, 4 weeks). Primary outcomes were treatment efficacy and success rate 4 weeks after completion of therapy. Secondary outcomes included changes in IIEF-5 score, sex encounter profile (SEP) score, erection hardness score (EHS) and NPTR assessments 4 weeks post-therapy. All enrolled patients (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a30 per group) completed the study. At baseline, age, IIEF-5 score, SEP score, EHS, and NPTR assessments were similar between groups.RESULTS: Four weeks post-therapy, IIEF-5 score increased in the ESWT (15.03\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a3.00 vs. 11.60\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a2.28) and VED (15.10\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a3.06 vs. 11.53\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a2.27) groups, as did SEP score, EHS, and NPTR measures (all P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). Efficacy in the ESWT and VED groups was excellent in 10% and 13.3%, respectively, and moderate in 63.3% and 53.3%, respectively. Treatment success rate in the ESWT and VED groups was 73.3% and 67.7%, respectively.CONCLUSION: VED use and ESWT have comparable efficacies in the treatment of ED in Chinese patients. labels: #Adult#China#Erectile Dysfunction#High-Energy Shock Waves#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Penile Erection#Prospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Treatment Outcome#Vacuum#Young Adult'
b'Our study aimed to evaluate the utility of muscle ultrasound in newborn screening of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and to establish a system of severity grading. We retrospectively selected 35 patients with initial low acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) activity and collected data including muscle ultrasound features, GAA gene mutation, activity/performance, and pathological and laboratory findings. The echogenicity of 6 muscles (the bilateral vastus intermedius, rectus femoris, and sartorius muscles) was compared to that of epimysium on ultrasound and rated either 1 (normal), 2 (mildly increased), or 3 (obviously increased). These grades were used to divide patients into 3 groups. IOPD was present in none of the grade-1 patients, 5 of 9 grade-2 patients, and 5 of 5 grade-3 patients (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Comparing grade-2 plus grade-3 patients to grade-1 patients, muscle ultrasound detected IOPD with a sensitivity and specificity of 100.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 69.2%-100%) and 84.0% (95% CI: 63.9%-95.5%), respectively. The mean number of affected muscles was larger in grade-3 patients than in grade-2 patients (4.2 vs. 2.0, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.005). Mean alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were differed significantly different between grade-3 and grade-1 patients (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Because it permits direct visualization of injured muscles, muscle ultrasound can be used to screen for IOPD. Our echogenicity grades of muscle injury also correlate well with serum levels of muscle-injury biochemical markers. labels: #Alanine Transaminase#Aspartate Aminotransferases#Biomarkers#Creatine Kinase#Female#Glycogen Storage Disease Type II#Humans#Infant, Newborn#L-Lactate Dehydrogenase#Male#Neonatal Screening#Quadriceps Muscle#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Ultrasonography#alpha-Glucosidases'
b'To explore the relationship between the extent of central nervous system (CNS) injury and patient outcomes meanwhile research the potential risk factors associated with neurologic sequelae. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from 117 consecutive patients (86 survivors, 31 nonsurvivors) with exertional heat stroke (EHS) who had been admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) at 48 Chinese hospitals between April 2003 and July 2015. Extent of CNS injury was dichotomized according to Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score (severe 3-8, not severe 9-15). We then assessed differences in hospital mortality based on the extent of CNS injury by comparing 90-day survival time between the patient groups. Exploring the risk factors of neurologic sequelae. The primary outcomewas the 90-day survival ratewhich differed between the 2 groups (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.023). The incidence of neurologic sequelae was 24.4%. For its risk factors, duration of recurrent hyperthermia (OR\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.73, 95% CI: 1.20-2.49, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.003), duration of CNS injury (OR\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.85, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.025), and low GCS in the first 24\xe2\x80\x8ahours after admission (OR\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a2.39, 95% CI: 1.11-5.15, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.025) were selected by multivariable logistic regression. Cooling effect was eliminated as a factor (OR\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a2641.27, 95% CI 0.40-1.73_107, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.079). Significant differences in 90-day survival ratewere observed based on the extent of CNS injury in patients with EHS, and incidence was 24.4% for neurologic sequelae. Duration of recurrent hyperthermia, duration of CNS injury, and low GCS score in the first 24\xe2\x80\x8ahours following admission may be independent risk factors of neurologic sequelae. Cooling effect should be validated in the further studies. labels: #Adult#Female#Fever#Glasgow Coma Scale#Heat Stroke#Hospital Mortality#Humans#Incidence#Intensive Care Units#Logistic Models#Male#Multivariate Analysis#Physical Exertion#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Time Factors#Trauma, Nervous System#Young Adult'
b'Although subjective global assessment (SGA) is a widely used tool for nutritional investigation, the scores are dependent on the inspectors\' subjective opinions, and there are only few studies that directly assessed the usefulness of SGA and modified SGA in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. A total of 365 incident PD patients between 2009 and 2015 were enrolled and measured with SGA and calculated using serum albumin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels for weighted SGA. Cox analyses were performed to delineate the association between SGA or weighted SGA and all-cause mortality, and a receiver-operating characteristic was conducted to reveal the additional benefit of weighted SGA on predicting adverse clinical outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the cumulative survival rate in patients with "Good nutrition" (G1) was significantly higher compared to those with "Mild to severe malnutrition" (G2). G2 was significantly associated with an increase in the mortality even after adjusting for several covariates compared with G1. Moreover, a 1-unit increase in weighted SGA was also significantly correlated with mortality after adjustment of the same covariates, while G2 was not significantly associated with an increase in the mortality among young-aged (under 65 years) groups. Meanwhile, a 1-unit increase in weighted SGA was significantly related to an increase in mortality in all the subgroup analyses. Furthermore, the AUCs of weighted SGAs in all groups were significantly increased compared with those of SGA alone. In conclusions, the evaluation of nutritional status based on SGA in incident PD patients might be useful for predicting mortality. However, weighted SGA with serum albumin and TIBC can provide additional predictive power for mortality compared with SGA alone in incident PD patients. labels: #Adult#Aged#Female#Humans#Iron#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Male#Malnutrition#Middle Aged#Nutrition Assessment#Nutritional Status#Peritoneal Dialysis#Predictive Value of Tests#Proportional Hazards Models#Prospective Studies#Regression Analysis#Serum Albumin#Survival Rate'

b'Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality worldwide. Despite recognition of the importance of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults, limited epidemiologic information is available in South Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the disease burden of hospitalized CAP in adults aged \xe2\x89\xa519 years and its epidemiologic trend using Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) data.This is a retrospective study using the HIRA database from year 2009 to 2013. We estimated the incidence rate and direct medical cost of hospitalized CAP in adults aged \xe2\x89\xa519 years in South Korea. These were further analyzed with respect to age and underlying medical conditions.During 2009 to 2013, 1216,916 hospitalizations were recorded. On average, the annual age-adjusted incidence rate of hospitalized CAP was 626 per 100,000 persons, with the rate increasing with age. When stratified by age- and risk groups, elderly people \xe2\x89\xa575 years showed the highest incidence rate of hospitalized CAP over 5-year study periods. With respect to the risk groups based on underlying medical conditions, incidence rate ratios were 2.04 to 5.86 for the high-risk group versus the low-risk group and 1.28 to 5.49 for the moderate-risk group versus the low-risk group. Overall, mean direct medical cost for hospitalized CAP was 1851 USD per capita during the 5-year period: 1263 USD in the low-risk group, 2353 USD in the moderate-risk group, and 2841 USD in the high-risk group.This study shows that the incidence and medical cost of hospitalized CAP were consistently high over the 5-year study period. In particular, elderly people and adults with underlying medical conditions were at increased risk for hospitalized CAP. labels: #Adult#Age Distribution#Age Factors#Community-Acquired Infections#Cost of Illness#Databases, Factual#Female#Health Care Costs#Hospitalization#Humans#Incidence#Insurance, Health#Male#Middle Aged#Pneumonia#Republic of Korea#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Young Adult'
b'Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly sensitive to radiotherapy. Locally advanced NPC has a relatively poor prognosis if treated with radiotherapy alone. Several studies have demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy confers survival benefit in locally advanced NPC. However, a small proportion of patients are resistant to chemotherapy based on cisplatin. So, it is important to make a valuable and inexpensive schedule for these patients. After 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy that consisted of gemcitabine and cisplatin (80\xe2\x80\x8amg/m, every 3 weeks) or paclitaxel and cisplatin (80\xe2\x80\x8amg/m, every 3 weeks), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate efficacy. A total of 13 patients with extensive nodal disease or/and bulky tumors volume were determined with a stable disease (SD) and enrolled in this study. Cisplatin at a dose of 30\xe2\x80\x8amg/m administered weekly concurrent with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was used to treat these patients resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The efficacy was evaluated by tumor response and the change of tumor volume. After the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), the overall tumor response was a complete response (CR) for 4 of 13 (30.8%) patients and partial response (PR) for 9 of 13 (69.2%) patients. The mean primary tumor volume was reduced by 59.7% and 89.8% at the 24th fraction of IMRT and after the completion of IMRT, respectively. The mean nodal volume was reduced by 63.8% and 93.5% at the 24th fraction of IMRT and after completion of IMRT, respectively. The study showed that weekly cisplatin concurrent with IMRT improved the treatment parameters for locally advanced NPC with resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on cisplatin. It was a valuable and relatively inexpensive schedule to improve the prognosis for these patients. labels: #Adult#Antineoplastic Agents#Carcinoma#Chemoradiotherapy#Cisplatin#Drug Administration Schedule#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms#Prognosis#Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated#Remission Induction#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Tumor Burden'
b"After age 85, upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy may be indicated in 5% to 10% of inpatients, but the risk-benefit ratio is unknown. We studied patients older than 85 years undergoing upper and lower GI endoscopy.We analyzed a retrospective cohort of inpatients older than 85 years between 2004 and 2012, all explored by upper and complete lower GI endoscopy. Initial indications, including iron deficiency anemia (IDA), other anemias, GI bleeding, weight loss, and GI symptoms, were noted, as were endoscopy or anesthesia complications, immediate endoscopic diagnosis, and the ability to modify the patients' therapeutics. Deaths and final diagnosis for initial endoscopic indication were analyzed after at least 12 months.We included 55 patients, 78% women, with a median age, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin, and ferritin levels of 87 (85-99), 56 (24-214) g/L, 8.6 (4.8-12.9) g/dL, and 56 (3-799) \xce\xbcg/L, respectively. IDA was the most frequent indication for endoscopy (60%; n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a33). Immediate diagnoses were found in 64% of the patients (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a35), including 25% with GI cancers (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a14) and 22% with gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a12). Cancer diagnosis was associated with lower reticulocyte count (45 vs. 60\xe2\x80\x8aG/L; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.02). Among the 35 diagnoses, 94% (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a33) led to modifications of the patients' therapeutics, with 29% of the patients deciding on palliative care (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a10). No endoscopic complications lead to death. Follow-up of>12 months was available in 82% (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a45) of the patients; among these patients, 40% (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a27) died after an average 24\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a18 months. Cancer diagnosis was significantly associated with less ulterior red cell transfusion (0% vs. 28%; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.02) and fewer further investigations (6.7% vs. 40%; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.02).Upper and complete lower GI endoscopy in patients older than 85 years appears to be safe, and enables a high rate of immediate diagnosis, with significant modifications of therapeutics. GI cancers represented more than one-third of the endoscopic diagnoses. labels: #Aged, 80 and over#Anemia, Iron-Deficiency#Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal#Female#Gastrointestinal Diseases#Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage#Gastrointestinal Neoplasms#Geriatric Assessment#Humans#Inpatients#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Odds Ratio#Retrospective Studies#Risk Assessment"
b'Emergency air medical transport (EAMT) is indispensable for acutely or critically ill patients in remote areas. We determined patient-level and transport-specific factors associated with all-cause mortality after EAMT.We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using a prospective registry consisting of clinical/medical records. Study inclusion criteria consisted of all adults undergoing EAMT from Kinmen hospital to the ED of Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2012. The primary outcome assessments were 7-day and 30-day mortality.A total of 370 patients transported to TVGH were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 54.5\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a21.5 (SD) years and with a male predominance (71.6%). The average in-transit time was 1.4\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.4\xe2\x80\x8ahours. The 7-day, 30-day, and in-hospital mortality rates were 10.3%, 14.1%, and 14.9%. Among them 33.5% (124/370) were categorized under neurological etiologies, whereas 24.9% (90/370) cardiovascular, followed by 16.2% (60/370) trauma patients. Independent predictors associated with 7-day all-cause mortality were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.043, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.016-1.070), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (OR 0.730, 95% CI 0.650-0.821), and hematocrit level (OR 0.930, 95% CI 0.878-0.985). Independent predictors associated with 30-day all-cause mortality were age (OR 1.028, 95% CI 1.007-1.049), GCS (OR 0.686, 95% CI 0.600-0.785), hematocrit (OR 0.940, 95% CI 0.895-0.988), hemodynamic instability (OR 5.088 95% CI 1.769-14.635), and endotracheal intubation (OR 0.131 95% CI 0.030-0.569). The 7-day and 30-day mortality were not significantly related to transport-specific factors, such as length of flight, type of paramedic crew on board, or day and season of transport. Clinical patient-level factors, as opposed to transport-level factors, were associated with 7- and 30-day all-cause mortality in patients undergoing interfacility EAMT from Kinmen to Taiwan. labels: #Adult#Age Factors#Aged#Air Ambulances#Cause of Death#Critical Illness#Emergency Medical Services#Female#Glasgow Coma Scale#Hospital Mortality#Humans#Intubation, Intratracheal#Male#Middle Aged#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Prospective Studies#Registries#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sex Factors#Taiwan#Time Factors#Transportation of Patients'
b'Early estimation of mortality risk in patients with trauma is essential. In this study, we evaluate the validity of the Emergency Trauma Score (EMTRAS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma. Furthermore, we compared the REMS and the EMTRAS with 2 other scoring systems: the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and Injury Severity score (ISS).We performed a retrospective chart review of 6905 patients with trauma reported between July 2011 and June 2016 at a large national university hospital in South Korea. We analyzed the associations between patient characteristics, treatment course, and injury severity scoring systems (ISS, RTS, EMTRAS, and REMS) with in-hospital mortality. Discriminating power was compared between scoring systems using the areas under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 3.1%. Higher EMTRAS and REMS scores were associated with hospital mortality (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). The ROC curve demonstrated adequate discrimination (AUC = 0.957 for EMTRAS and 0.9 for REMS). After performing AUC analysis followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, EMTRAS was significantly superior to REMS and ISS in predicting in-hospital mortality (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), but not significantly different from the RTS (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.057). The other scoring systems were not significantly different from each other.The EMTRAS and the REMS are simple, accurate predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma. labels: #Adult#Aged#Area Under Curve#Emergency Medicine#Female#Hospital Mortality#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Predictive Value of Tests#ROC Curve#Reproducibility of Results#Republic of Korea#Retrospective Studies#Risk Assessment#Trauma Severity Indices#Wounds and Injuries'
b'Several risk factors for pancreatic fistula had been widely reported, but there was no research focusing on the exocrine output of remnant gland.During the study period of January 2015 to September 2016, 82 patients accepted pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD, end-to-end dunking pancreaticojejunostomy with internal stent tube). All the data were collected, including preoperative medical status, operative course, final pathology, gland texture, pancreatic duct diameter, size of the stent, length of pancreatic juice in the stent tube, width of the pancreatic stump, diameter of the jejunum and the status of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). POPF was defined according to International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria.The diameter of pancreatic duct in the POPF group was significantly smaller than that in the group without POPF (1.99 vs 2.90\xe2\x80\x8amm, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000). The length of pancreatic juice in the stent tube in the POPF group was significantly longer than that in the group without POPF (18.04 vs 6.92\xe2\x80\x8acm, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.014). There were more pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases and hard glands in the group without POPF. The length of pancreatic juice in the clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) group was significantly longer than that in the grade A group (32.4 vs 9.21\xe2\x80\x8acm, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000). Multivariate analysis identified gland texture and length of pancreatic juice as independent predictors for pancreatic fistula. Multivariate analysis also identified the length of pancreatic juice as an independent predictor for CR-POPF.The length of pancreatic juice in the stent tube might be a useful predictive factor of POPF after PD, especially for CR-POPF. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal#Female#Humans#Jejunum#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Pancreas#Pancreas, Exocrine#Pancreatic Fistula#Pancreatic Juice#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Pancreaticoduodenectomy#Pancreaticojejunostomy#Postoperative Complications#Postoperative Period#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Stents#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'The initial diagnosis of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is based on nervous system clinical manifestations. The use of biomarkers to monitor brain injury and evaluate neuroprotective effects allows early intervention and treatment. This study was designed to determine the short-term prognostic significance of urinary S100B calcium-binding protein (S100B) in asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia.An observational prospective study was conducted over a period of 5 years in 31 newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy who received therapeutic hypothermia. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A (13 newborns with a normal neurological examination before discharge) and Group B (18 newborns who died during admission or had an abnormal neurologic examination before discharge). Urinary S100B was the main variable, serum S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were considered as secondary variables, and all of them were assessed on the first 3 days of life. The newborns were subsequently divided into groups with normal and abnormal electrophysiological and imaging findings.Mean urinary S100B levels were significantly higher in group B than group A on day 1 (10.58\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a14.82 vs 4.65\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a9.16\xe2\x80\x8a\xce\xbcg/L, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.031) and day 2 (5.16\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a7.63 vs 0.88\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a2.53, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.002). The optimal cutoff for urinary S100B on day 1 was>1.11\xe2\x80\x8a\xce\xbcg/L of (sensitivity, 100%; specificity 60%) for the prediction of neonatal death and\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a0.66\xe2\x80\x8a\xce\xbcg/L (sensitivity 83% and specificity 70%) for the prediction of a normal neurological examination before discharge. It was not possible to calculate cutoffs with a similar accuracy for serum S100B or NSE. Urinary S100B on day 1 was higher in patients with abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings (7.89\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a8.09 vs 4.49\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a9.14, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.039) and abnormal positron emission tomography findings (8.60\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a9.29 vs 4.30\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a8.28, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.038). There were no significant differences in S100B levels between patients with normal and abnormal electroencephalography results.Urinary S100B measured in the first days of life can predict neonatal death and short-term prognosis in asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia. The method is convenient, noninvasive, and has a higher sensitivity and specificity than measurement of serum S100B or NSE. labels: #Biomarkers#Electroencephalography#Female#Humans#Hypothermia, Induced#Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain#Infant, Newborn#Male#Neurologic Examination#Perinatal Death#Phosphopyruvate Hydratase#Prognosis#Prospective Studies#S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit#Sensitivity and Specificity'
b'High viral load is an independent risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Antiviral therapy can reduce but not eliminate the risk of HCC. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for HCC development in CHB patients during antiviral therapy.CHB patients with HBV DNA level \xe2\x89\xa510\xe2\x80\x8acopies/mL, with or without compensated cirrhosis receiving adefovir were followed up every 6 months for 10 years (2004-2014). The primary endpoint was the development of HCC. The cumulative incidence and risk factors of HCC were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.At baseline, 28 of the 120 patients (23.3%) were cirrhotic. One patient developed HCC within 1 year, and therefore 119 patients were analyzed. At the end-point of follow-up, 59.7% (71/119) patients achieved virological remission (VR). Overall, 16 patients developed HCC, giving a 10-year cumulative incidence of 15.73%. Multivariate analysis showed that cirrhosis at baseline and failure to achieve VR were significant risk factors for HCC. The 10-year incidence of HCC was significantly higher in cirrhotic than noncirrhotic patients (43.16% vs. 7.05%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.0001). For cirrhotic patients, the 10-year incidence of HCC was significantly higher in patients without VR than those with VR (62.24% vs. 27.78%, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0139).Cirrhosis at baseline and failure to achieve VR during antiviral therapy were significant risk factors for HCC development in CHB patients. Effective viral suppression is necessary to reduce HCC development in cirrhotic CHB patients. labels: #Adenine#Adult#Antiviral Agents#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Hepatitis B virus#Hepatitis B, Chronic#Humans#Incidence#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Liver Cirrhosis#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Organophosphonates#Proportional Hazards Models#Prospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sustained Virologic Response#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome#Viral Load'
b'RATIONALE: Salmonella enterica subsp arizonae is a common gut inhabitant of reptiles (snakes are the most common reservoir, but it also occurs in turtles). Alhough human cases owing to this organism are exceedingly rare, it may occasionally infect young infants and immunocompromised individuals with a history of intimate associations with reptiles. Our case is the 20th one among the infections with S arizonae in children, but the 2nd one of otitis and the first of mastoiditis. The other cases had different anatomical locations, such as gastroenteritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, ankle infection, wound infection, and sinusitis.PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: We report a rare case of otitis with Salmonella in a previously healthy adolescent, which was most likely acquired after bathing in a lake. The ear infection was complicated with mastoiditis. Audiometric testing showed a moderately conductive hearing loss (60\xe2\x80\x8adB on pure-tone average).INTERVENTION: Standard therapy for S arizonae was initiated. The surgery revealed a "hidden" cholesteatoma. Surgical management comprised of canal wall up mastoidectomy with attico-antrotomy and posterior tympanotomy followed by tympanoplasty.OUTCOMES: Daily postoperative dressing care of the incision, along with antibiotic lavage of the external auditory canal packing, ensured a favorable evolution. The functional gain was important; the 1-month postsurgical pure tone audiogram indicated nearly normal hearing (a mean of 25\xe2\x80\x8adB for air conduction thresholds).LESSON: Salmonella enterica serotype arizonae is a rare cause of human infection, being a common organism in reptiles, like snakes and turtles. Young children are at a particular risk for acquiring such infections. Our study might encourage further epidemiologic investigations into these infections to generate a more effective strategy among public health agencies. labels: #Adolescent#Humans#Lakes#Male#Mastoiditis#Otitis Media#Salmonella Infections#Salmonella arizonae'
b'Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is associated with long lengths of stay (LOS); however, it is not known whether the effect is equal across different chief complaints.The aim of the study was to compare the effect of crowding on LOS in the 10 most common medical or surgical chief complaints in the ED.All adult visits to a university hospital ED on weekdays between 8 AM and 9 PM in 2012 (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a19,200) were stratified based on chief complaint and triage priority. The ED bed occupancy rate was measured and crowding was defined as an occupancy rate over one. The impact of crowding on LOS was calculated for the different groups.During crowding, LOS was longer among all chief complaints (P \xe2\x89\xa4.01) (except for high-acuity patients with wounds, where the study group was very small). During crowding, LOS increased the most among patients with extremity pain/swelling (145% among high-acuity patients, 125% among low-acuity patients) and flank pain (87% among high-acuity patients, 117% among low-acuity patients) and the least among patients with chest pain (32% among high-acuity patients, 45% among low-acuity patients) or arrhythmia (37% among high-acuity patients, 52% among low-acuity patients).The effect of ED crowding on LOS is unequal across different chief complaints. These findings could be used to improve the processing of specific chief complaints in the ED. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Cohort Studies#Cross-Sectional Studies#Crowding#Emergency Service, Hospital#Female#Hospitals, University#Humans#Length of Stay#Male#Middle Aged#Patient Acuity#Time Factors#Triage#Young Adult'
b'This study aimed to observe the change in nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels and analyzed its related factors in adults with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance).This case-controlled study included 56 adults with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 74 adults with prediabetes. The cases and controls were age and gender-matched. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were performed. All patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after 8 hours of fasting, and the levels of glucose, insulin, lipids, and uric acid were measured.The levels of non-HDL-C (3.63\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.92 vs 3.27\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a1.00\xe2\x80\x8ammol/L) were significantly higher in prediabetic subjects than in NGT subjects (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). Non-HDL-C positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.253, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.004), triglyceride (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.204, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.020), and uric acid (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.487, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000). After multivariate analysis, uric acid continued to be significantly associated with non-HDL-C (\xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.006, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000).Non-HDL-C is elevated in adults with prediabetes.

b'PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to explore surgical strategies for effectively treating spine fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and investigate the postoperative outcomes.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 9 patients with AS that was complicated by spine fractures, who underwent surgery at our spine and spinal cord clinic between 2005 and 2012. The surgical methods included posterior instrumentation and bone grafting, with or without decompression. Fracture healing and neurological function recovery were observed postoperatively. The average follow-up period was 45.1 months (range: 24-60).RESULTS: The 9 patients included 7 men and 2 women. Eight patients were treated with long posterior fixation. One patient underwent combined long posterior fixation and anterior bone grafting. The neurological function of these patients improved significantly to varying degrees after surgery, and fracture union and segmental instability of the lumbar vertebrae were radiologically confirmed at the 1-month and 2-year follow-up intervals. Severe surgery-related complications were not observed.CONCLUSIONS: Posterior instrumentation with bone grafting was a satisfying method for treating spine fractures in patients with AS. labels: #Adult#Bone Transplantation#Combined Modality Therapy#Decompression, Surgical#Female#Fracture Fixation#Humans#Lumbar Vertebrae#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Spinal Fractures#Spondylitis, Ankylosing#Treatment Outcome'
b'Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Due to the poor prognosis for patients not responding to first-line steroids treatment, improvements in aGVHD therapy are needed. Everolimus is a promising candidate that combines immunosuppressive properties with anti-neoplastic effects. Here, we retrospectively reviewed the efficacy of everolimus with steroids as primary treatment in 13 patients with grade II to grade IV aGVHD after HSCT. Among them, 12 (92.3%) had complete response to everolimus with steroids without additional immunosuppressive agents. The median duration of therapy was 76 days (range 20-110). Asymptomatic hypertriglyceridemia was the most common therapy complication (69.2%), but treatment interruption was not needed. Thrombotic microangiopathy was rare (7.7%), but can be quickly solved by stopping everolimus and cyclosporine treatment. Other toxicities were manageable. Two patients developed chronic GVHD (15.4%), limited in one and extensive in the other. The overall survival was 76.9% with a median follow-up of 3.4 years after HSCT (range 0.7-5.7). Accordingly, everolimus with steroids were feasible for patients with aGVHD after HSCT as primary treatment. Further large-scale studies are required. labels: #Acute Disease#Adolescent#Child#Child, Preschool#Cyclosporine#Drug Therapy, Combination#Everolimus#Feasibility Studies#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Graft vs Host Disease#Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation#Humans#Hypertriglyceridemia#Immunosuppressive Agents#Infant#Male#Pilot Projects#Retrospective Studies#Steroids#Thrombotic Microangiopathies#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: We investigated the sudden onset of static equilibrium dysfunction caused by cochlear implantation (CI) in congenital hearing loss patients.METHOD: Twenty-five patients were selected from a cohort of unilateral CI recipients to form the CI group. Static posturography was performed 1 to 3 days before and 3 to 5 days after CI. Each patient underwent the test with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) for 30\xe2\x80\x8aseconds, separately. Another group of age- and sex-matched patients with no history of hearing impairment undergoing unrelated surgeries formed the control group, and were examined with the same tests pre- and post-surgery. A third group of patients undergoing middle ear surgery formed the otitis media (OM) group. Postural sway parameters including sway velocity (SV) in the X-axis, SV in the Y-axis, length of sway locus length (LNG), and environmental area (ENV) were measured and recorded.RESULTS: Comparison of pre-surgery posturographical parameters between the CI and control groups revealed no significant differences. Significant differences were found in most parameters in pre- and post-surgery comparisons in the CI group. Mean SV values in the X-axis pre- and post-surgery were 8.48 and 11.52\xe2\x80\x8amm/s, respectively, in the EO condition (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05), and 14.94 and 20.16\xe2\x80\x8amm/s, respectively, in the EC condition (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). In the Y-axis, mean SV values were 15.36 and 20.24\xe2\x80\x8amm/s pre- and post-surgery, respectively, in the EC condition (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). The LNG values in the CI group pre- and post-surgery were 319.60 and 469.88\xe2\x80\x8amm in the EO condition (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05), and 571.40 and 764.12\xe2\x80\x8amm in the EC condition (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). No significant functional equilibrium change was observed in the control group between pre- and post-surgery (P\xe2\x80\x8a>\xe2\x80\x8a.05) except SV in the X-axis and LNG in the EO condition (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). No significant pre- and post-surgery differences were found in the OM group.CONCLUSION: CI appeared to influence static equilibrium function within 1 week post-surgery. This influence was greater when eyes were closed. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Case-Control Studies#Child#Cochlear Implantation#Cochlear Implants#Female#Hearing Loss#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Postural Balance#Sensation Disorders#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'RATIONALE: The fundamental pathogenesis of Beh\xc3\xa7et disease (BD) is still unclear and controversial. Many cases of oral aphthous ulcers and genital ulcers related to BD are reported; nevertheless, idiopathic giant esophageal ulcers related to BD are rare. A rare case for esophageal ulcers related to BD is presented.PATIENT CONCERNS: In China, BD is represented with esophageal involvement which is called esophageal BD (EBD).DIAGNOSES: A 56-year-old man diagnosed to the Gastroenterology Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, for multiple discrete, elliptical esophageal ulcers related to BD.INTERVENTIONS: The esophageal ulcers were treated with corticosteroid treatment for 12 weeks.OUTCOME: The esophageal ulcers were cured.LESSONS: Our report might give further strength to avoiding the erroneous diagnosis or missed diagnosis for EBD, which is different from esophageal carcinoma, esophageal tuberculosis and esophageal Crohns disease. labels: #Adrenal Cortex Hormones#Behcet Syndrome#Esophageal Diseases#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Rare Diseases#Treatment Outcome#Ulcer'
b'RATIONALE: The multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as cediranib, sunitinib and pazopanib have been reported to be effective for alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). The efficacy of pazopanib for the patient with lingual ASPS has yet to be reported.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-year old man presented with articulation disorder and swelling of the tongue. Diagnosis of lingual ASPS was made after incisional biopsy and complete excision of the mass was performed. Three months later, he presented with a protruding mental region.DIAGNOSES: Computed tomography revealed mental region mass and lung metastasis.INTERVENTIONS: After the failure of combination therapy of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, pazopanib was administered.OUTCOMES: Shrinkage of both the mental region and lung mass continued for more than two months, but regrowth was confirmed at the fourth month.LESSONS: Lingual ASPS is an exceedingly rare subset of ASPS with distinct molecular and histological characteristics and appropriate therapy remains to be established. Our findings suggest a possible therapeutic strategy for lingual ASPS. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Humans#Male#Pyrimidines#Sarcoma, Alveolar Soft Part#Sulfonamides#Tongue Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'RATIONALE: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a relatively rare but potentially disabling disease, and the classical presentation of it includes an acute onset of severe, sometimes radiating back or neck pain, followed by signs and symptoms of rapidly evolving nerve root or spinal cord compression.PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report a 26-year-old female patient presented with weakness in bilateral lower extremities, progressing to intense paraplegia and anesthesia without recent medical history of trauma, infection, surgery, or drug use.DIAGNOSIS: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of spinal cord was planned and a posterior epidural hematoma of the thoracic spine was observed.INTERVENTIONS: A posterior decompression and hematoma evacuation was performed after diagnosis immediately. Early rehabilitation program of the specific kind spinal cord injury was formulated and implemented.OUTCOMES: The patient finally can handle basic living activities, such as completing wheelchair locomotion, transferring from bed to wheelchair independently after 3 months of rehabilitation.LESSONS: SSEH is a rarely occurring case in emergency. Acute chest pain and paraplegia could be the initial presentation of acute spinal epidural hemorrhage, but the diagnosis of patient without classical manifestations is still a challenge for doctors. Early diagnosis, prompt decompression, and individualized rehabilitation program can improve the prognosis and outcome. labels: #Activities of Daily Living#Adult#Decompression, Surgical#Female#Hematoma, Epidural, Spinal#Humans#Paraplegia#Paresis#Thoracic Vertebrae#Treatment Outcome#Wheelchairs'
b'Depression and suicidal ideation are prevalent mental health problems in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD. However, the association between mental health problems and kidney disease has been investigated in severe cases only. Thus, this study evaluated the relationship between mental health problems and renal function in a community-based prospective cohort study comprising patients with mild to moderate kidney disease. A total of 44,938 participants who were participated in Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV, V, and VI from 2007 to 2014 were enrolled. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation. The study outcome was the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideations assessed by self-reporting surveys. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between renal function and outcomes. The mean age of the study subjects was 49.2\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a16.6 years, and the mean eGFR was 94.0\xe2\x80\x8amL/min/1.73\xe2\x80\x8am. The prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation increased with decreasing eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of depression increased in subjects with eGFR<45\xe2\x80\x8amL/min/1.73\xe2\x80\x8am [odds ratio (OR) 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.98]. The risk of suicidal ideation gradually increased in groups with eGFR<90\xe2\x80\x8amL/min/1.73\xe2\x80\x8am (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20), even after adjustments for confounding variables. In conclusion, depression and suicidal ideation are related closely with renal dysfunction. The risk of having depression and suicidal ideation increased even in patient with mild renal dysfunction. Therefore, evaluation and management strategies regarding mental health problems should be taken into account throughout all stages of CKD. labels: #Adult#Depression#Disease Progression#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Nutrition Surveys#Odds Ratio#Prevalence#Prospective Studies#Renal Insufficiency, Chronic#Republic of Korea#Risk Factors#Suicidal Ideation#Time Factors'
b'BACKGROUND: Uterine niche is defined as a triangular anechoic structure at the site of the scar or a gap in the myometrium at the site of a previous caesarean section. The main clinical manifestations are postmenstrual spotting and intrauterine infection, which may seriously affect the daily life of nonpregnant women. Trials have shown an excellent safety and efficacy for the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a therapeutic option for scar reconstruction. Therefore, this study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of using MSCs in the treatment for the uterine niche.METHODS/DESIGN: This phase II clinical trial is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with 2 arms. One hundred twenty primiparous participants will be randomly (1:1 ratio) assigned to receive direct intramuscular injection of MSCs (a dose of 1*10 cells in 1\xe2\x80\x8amL of 0.9% saline) (MSCs group) or an identical-appearing 1\xe2\x80\x8amL of 0.9% saline (placebo-controlled group) near the uterine incision. The primary outcome of this trial is to evaluate the proportion of participants at 6 months who is found uterine niche in the uterus by transvaginal utrasonography. Adverse events will be documented in a case report form. The study will be conducted at the Department of Obstetric of Southern Medical University Affiliated Maternal&Child Health Hospital of Foshan.DISCUSSION: This trial is the first investigation of the potential for therapeutic use of MSCs for the management of uterine niche after cesarean delivery.CONCLUSION: This protocol will help to determine the efficacy and safety of MSCs treatment in uterine niche and bridge the gap with regards to the current preclinical and clinical evidence.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02968459 (Clinical Trials.gov: http://clinicaltrials.gov/). labels: #Adult#Cesarean Section#Cicatrix#Clinical Protocols#Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation#Double-Blind Method#Female#Humans#Injections, Intramuscular#Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation#Postoperative Complications#Pregnancy#Prospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Uterine Diseases#Uterus'
b"RATIONALE: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alveolar surfactant protein in alveolar spaces. Secondary PAP can result from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).PATIENT CONCERNS: But most reports described a single case; here we reported 2 cases of PAP secondary to MDS. One case developed secondary PAP at the same time as MDS, and the other developed during the course of MDS.DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis of PAP was made by bronchoalveolar lavage and based on the identification of periodic acid-Schiff-positive proteinaceous material. Chest high resolution CT (HRCT) scans showed variable distribution of ground glass opacities, but crazy-paving appearance was not seen in our 2 cases.INTERVENTIONS: Because the patients' general conditions were poor, whole lung lavage was not used in the 2 cases.OUTCOMES: And the 2 cases' prognoses were poor.LESSONS: In conclusion, pulmonary physicians should suspect the possibility of secondary PAP when they encounter unexplained pulmonary infiltrates with some hematologic or infectious disease that shows diffuse bilateral GGO on an HRCT scan. labels: #Adult#Aged#Bronchoalveolar Lavage#Female#Humans#Male#Myelodysplastic Syndromes#Prognosis#Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis"
b'We retrospectively compared overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with single (3-5\xe2\x80\x8acm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A treated by surgical resection (SR), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Of the 38,167 HCC patients registered between 2008 and 2010 at Korea Central Cancer Registry, National Cancer Center of South Korea, 13% patients were randomly abstracted, and 4596 patients could be analyzed. Of these 4596 patients, 337 patients with single 3 to 5\xe2\x80\x8acm sized HCC with BCLC stage A were enrolled. OSs and PFSs among SR (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a151), RFA (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a36), and TACE groups (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a150) were compared, respectively. Propensity score (PS) weighting was used to adjust differences among 3 groups.Median follow-up duration was 45 months (range, 1-73 months). After PS weighting, the cumulative OS rates were significantly higher in the SR (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and RFA (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.027) groups than in the TACE group, respectively, but not statistically different between SR and RFA groups (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.116). The cumulative PFS rates were significantly higher in the SR (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and RFA (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) groups than in the TACE group, respectively. TACE (hazard ratio [HR] 2.46, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), serum albumin (HR 0.57, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.002), and tumor size (HR 1.66, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001) were predictors for OS. TACE (HR 3.14, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), serum bilirubin (HR 1.38, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.020), and tumor size (HR 1.32, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.024) were predictors for PFS.RFA has better OS and PFS rates than TACE, and provides comparable survival outcomes compared with SR in single (3-5\xe2\x80\x8acm) HCC with BCLC stage A. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Catheter Ablation#Chemoembolization, Therapeutic#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Hepatectomy#Humans#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Propensity Score#Proportional Hazards Models#Registries#Republic of Korea#Retrospective Studies#Survival Rate#Treatment Outcome'
b"Because of the aging population and the shortage of standardized institutional solutions for long-term care (LTC) in China, family caregivers in Beijing are increasingly called upon to provide home care for disabled older adults. Caregivers face a heavy care burden, and decreased physical and mental health (MH). This study aims to describe health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and to identify its predictors for Chinese family caregivers of disabled older adults.A total of 766 caregivers were recruited from 5 communities in the Dongcheng District of Beijing. Measures included the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) scales, and the Chinese Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) analysis was used to identify the predictors.HMR analysis showed that each block of independent variables (demographic characteristics of disabled older adults, demographic characteristics of caregivers, caregiving context, and subjective caregiver burden) had contributed significantly to caregivers' physical and mental quality of life. Subjective caregiver burden explained the greatest amount of total variance in all MH subscales and the 2nd greatest amount of variance in most physical subscales. Therefore, subjective caregiver burden was the strongest predictor of HRQoL.Our findings suggest that a decrease in caregiver burden can improve caregivers' HRQoL, and additional social support is important in decreasing the impact of caregiving on HRQoL. Importantly, an LTC system should be established in China as soon as possible. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Beijing#Caregivers#Cost of Illness#Cross-Sectional Studies#Disabled Persons#Female#Health Status#Health Surveys#Humans#Long-Term Care#Male#Middle Aged#Quality of Life#Regression Analysis#Social Support"
b'Lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) is promising in determining prognosis and treatment strategies, but the application of LVI as a histopathological criterion in breast cancer patients especially those of different subgroups is controversial. This research aims to evaluate the prognostic value of LVI assessed by D2-40 not only in patients with early invasive breast cancer but also in lymph node-negative, lymph node-positive, luminal A-like, luminal B-like, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative subgroups.The study cohort included 255 patients with a median follow-up of 101 months. Immunohistochemical staining for D2-40 was performed to identify LVI.LVI was present in 64 (25.1%), 15 (12.1%), 49 (37.4%), 19 (20.9%), 23 (27.7%), 13 (31.7%), and 9 (22.5%), respectively, in the whole cohort, lymph node-negative, lymph node-positive, luminal A-like, luminal B-like, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative patients. LVI was associated with large tumor size (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.04), high histological grade (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.004), involved lymph node (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), and high expression of Ki-67 (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.003). No significant difference was found among patients with different subtypes and LVI status. The presence of LVI was significantly associated with adverse disease-free survival in the whole cohort (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), lymph node-negative (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), lymph node-positive (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), luminal A-like (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), and luminal B-like patients (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) in both of the univariate and multivariate survival analysis.This study indicated that the presence of LVI stained by D2-40 provided independent prognostic information not only in the whole cohort but also in the subgroup of patients with lymph node-negative, lymph node-positive, luminal A-like, and luminal B-like diseases, which may make a case for routine clinical assessment of LVI using D2-40. labels: #Adult#Aged#Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived#Biomarkers, Tumor#Breast Neoplasms#China#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Lymphatic Metastasis#Lymphatic Vessels#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Prognosis'
b'RATIONALE: Infantile desmoid fibromatosis of the postcricoid area is a rare disease and is characterized by a proliferation of fibrous tissue with non-metastasis, local infiltration, and a high rate of recurrence after surgical resection. Currently, ultrasound is scarcely used in the hypopharynx and larynx area.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 4-year-old boy presented with hoarseness, deep voice and snoring for 2\xe2\x88\xbc4 years without any surgical history. On sonography, the lesion was found in the postcricoid area, and the left larynx showed impaired mobility in real time observation. Complete excision with a negative margin in this pivotal anatomic area is impossible, and necessitates a long-time surveillance.DIAGNOSES: Infantile desmoid fibromatosis of the postcricoid area was diagnosed according to surgery and histopathology.INTERVENTIONS: Local excision was carried out to relieve the upper airway narrowing.OUTCOMES: Relieved hoarseness and snoring were reported on the latest follow-up. A residual lesion was seen in the surgical bed and maintained a stable extent on ultrasound and MR imaging after a year.LESSONS: Considering the non-radiation merit and diagnostic ability, ultrasonography is advocated as a valuable supplementary imaging method to CT, MR and laryngoscopy in the juvenile larynx and hypopharynx. labels: #Child, Preschool#Cricoid Cartilage#Fibromatosis, Aggressive#Hoarseness#Humans#Laryngeal Neoplasms#Male#Ultrasonography'
b'Iron is an intracellular element whose accumulation in the body is associated with tissue damage. This study examines the effect of iron on pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its "response to treatment." At the end of the first year of treatment, bone marrow iron store (BMIS) was evaluated in children with ALL and the relationship between iron store and minimal residual disease was investigated. Moreover, the 3-year disease-free survival (3-DFS) of patients was determined. Patients\' BMIS were compared with that of subjects with normal bone marrow. The study examined 93 children, including 78 Pre-B and 15 T-cell ALL patients. BMIS did not differ between the children with ALL and those with no evidence of cancer. BMIS was increased in 26.6% of patients at the end of the first year of treatment. Drug resistance and BM relapses were more prevalent in cases with high BMIS in both Pre-B and T-cell groups. Bone marrow iron store is not considered a risk factor for childhood ALL. However, high levels of BMIS are associated with poor response to treatment and the risk of relapse. Bone marrow iron store control during treatment can therefore help achieve better outcomes and improve the chances of recovery. labels: #Adolescent#Antineoplastic Agents#Bone Marrow#Child#Child, Preschool#Drug Resistance, Neoplasm#Female#Humans#Infant#Iron#Male#Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma#Treatment Outcome'
b'RATIONALE: Tumor chemotherapy could weaken the immune system of patients, which might enhance the body sensitivities to the exogenous pathogens, among which the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should be concerned because of the higher chances of infection and the severe outcomes, especially in East Asia. The titer level of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) higher than 10\xe2\x80\x8aIU/L is considered to offer immunocompetent individuals adequate protection. However, whether this level is enough to the tumor patients during chemotherapy remains unclear.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 58-year-old female lymphoma patient was admitted to our hospital for asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and abnormal liver function lasting over 1 week and diagnosed as acute hepatitis B. The patient just finished a course of chemotherapy with CHOP regimen and had recent record (78.61\xe2\x80\x8aIU/L) of HBsAb positive. The only risk of infection we could found was that the patient had received blood transfusion shortly after chemotherapy from a donor who was recovering from an asymptomatic acute HBV infection.INTERVENTION: The patient was administered with entecavir and glycyrrhizic acid agent, and then the disease was resolved successfully with hepatitis B surface antigen serological conversion.LESSONS: Tumor chemotherapy might have weakened the immune system of the patient and enhanced the body sensitivities to hepatitis B virus, then led to the infection. We concluded that HBsAb-positive status, at least "weakly positive," might not enough to provide protection for tumor patients on chemotherapy though this level was enough for health individuals and donors recuperating from subclinical acute hepatitis B might be another potential risk of HBV infection. labels: #Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Antiviral Agents#Cyclophosphamide#Doxorubicin#Female#Guanine#Hepatitis B#Hepatitis B Antibodies#Hepatitis B Surface Antigens#Hepatitis B virus#Humans#Lymphoma#Middle Aged#Prednisolone#Transfusion Reaction#Vincristine'
b'Early rehabilitation after surgery for patellar fracture is challenging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of titanium cable cerclage for patellar fracture in early functional activity.We reviewed a series of 24 patients treated at our hospital with titanium cable. Functional exercises were started early. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months.Fifteen were males and 9 were females. Fracture occurred in the right knee in 13 patients and in the left knee in 11 patients. The most common mode of injury involves a tumble. None of the patients presented with any postoperative complications. The management resulted in satisfactory outcomes.Titanium cable cerclage offers a new strategy in treating patellar fracture. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Bone Wires#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Fracture Fixation, Internal#Fractures, Bone#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Patella#Retrospective Studies#Titanium#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'Surgical methods for type II odontoid fracture can be classified into 2 main groups: anterior or posterior approach. A more effective way to achieve bone fusion with the lowest possible surgical risk is needed. Therefore, the aim of our study was to describe and evaluate a novel technique, cable-dragged reduction/cantilever beam internal fixation for the treatment of type II odontoid fracture.This was a retrospective study enrolled 34 patients underwent posterior cable-dragged reduction/cantilever-beam internal fixation surgery. Medical records, rates of reduction, the location of the instrumentation and fracture healing during follow-up were analyzed. Once fracture healing was obtained, instrumentation was removed. Neck pain (scored using a visual analog scale [VAS]), neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and neck disability index (NDI) were recorded before and after removing the instrumentation during follow-up.The mean duration of follow up was 22.8\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a5.3 months. There was no iatrogenic damage to nerves or blood vessels. Radiographic evaluation showed complete reduction in the 20 patients with fracture displacement and satisfactory fracture healing in all 34 cases. Titanium cable breakage was observed in 4 patients after fracture healing. After removal of instrumentation, significant improvements were seen in neck-pain VAS score, neck stiffness, patient satisfaction, and NDI (all P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01).Posterior cable-dragged reduction/cantilever-beam internal fixation was an optimal salvage maneuver to conventional surgical methods such as anterior screw fixation and C1-C2 screw-rod system. The operative difficulty and incidence of nerve and vascular injury were reduced. Its major disadvantage is the exposure and screw-setting at C3, which is left intact in traditional surgery, and it is suitable only for patients with intact C1 posterior arches. labels: #Adult#Bone Wires#Closed Fracture Reduction#Female#Fracture Fixation, Internal#Fracture Healing#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neck Pain#Odontoid Process#Pain Measurement#Retrospective Studies#Salvage Therapy#Spinal Fractures#Titanium#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'RATIONALE: The nasoseptal flap has been widely used to reconstruct skull base defects with excellent success rates. Recently, there were several attempts to use this flap for other defects. Patient concerns: We present the case of the nasoseptal flap reconstruction after oropharyngeal cancer resection.DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of this patient was oropharyngeal T3 squamous cell carcinoma.INTERVENTIONS: The surgical resection included the right radical tonsillectomy, uvular, and part of the soft palate and hard palate. The nasoseptal flap was sutured to the oropharyngeal defect.OUTCOMES: In spite of the radiation therapy, the nasoseptal flap was well healed to the oropharyngeal defect.LESSONS: We suggest that the nasoseptal flap may be a feasible reconstruction option for oropharyngeal defect after oropharyngeal cancer resection. labels: #Aged#Carcinoma, Squamous Cell#Humans#Male#Nasal Septum#Oropharyngeal Neoplasms#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Surgical Flaps#Treatment Outcome'
b'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for spirometry parameters have been limited to forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and their ratio. This study examined to identify genetic variants associated with maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), an important spirometry parameter presenting inspiratory muscle strength.A total of 8842 Korean subjects participated in the Korean Association REsource Consortium were used to identify nucleotide variants associated with MVV and other spirometry parameters through a GWAS. Genetic associations were determined by employing a mixed model that can control background polygenic effects.The analysis revealed 3 nucleotide variants associated with MVV (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a5\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8a10). One (rs1496255) was also associated with FVC and FEV1. The other 2 variants were identified only for MVV and located in the genes of LOC102724340 (rs41434646) and FHIT (rs9833533). In particular, FHIT represses transcriptional activity of \xce\xb2-catenin, a critical protein for growth of skeletal muscle, and thus might have influenced the level of MVV.The current study revealed 2 novel nucleotide variants as genetic association signals for MVV. The association signals were suggested specific for neuromuscular diseases with a restrictive ventilatory impairment. Further studies are required to understand underlying mechanisms for their influence to restrictive lung diseases. labels: #Acid Anhydride Hydrolases#Asian Continental Ancestry Group#Carrier Proteins#Female#Forced Expiratory Volume#Genetic Variation#Genome-Wide Association Study#Humans#Lung#Lung Diseases#Male#Maximal Voluntary Ventilation#Membrane Glycoproteins#Neoplasm Proteins#Republic of Korea#Spirometry#Vital Capacity'
b'Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (PTGBD+LC) is one treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acute cholecystitis (AC). However, the impact of PTGBD on operative difficulties in performing LC is controversial. We designed this retrospective study to clarify the surgical outcomes after PTGBD+LC for the management of patients with moderate to severe AC.The medical records of 85 patients who underwent LC for moderate to severe AC from January 2013 to September 2016 were evaluated. They were divided into 2 groups based on the type of management: group A received PTGBD+LC, and group B received LC without drainage. We compared the patient characteristics, laboratory data which were obtained immediately before surgery or PTGBD at index admission, and surgical outcomes between the 2 groups. We also evaluated possible predictive factors associated with prolonged operative duration after PTGBD+LC.Patients in group A were older and had more comorbidities than those in group B. The laboratory tests obtained at index admission in group A showed higher serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and alkaline phosphatase, and lower albumin levels than those in group B. The surgical outcomes after LC were similar between the 2 groups. However, operative duration was significantly shorter in group A (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.012). In group A, a higher serum level of CRP was a predictive factor for a prolonged operation (hazard ratio 1.126; 95% confidence interval 1.012-1.253; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.029). In conclusion, PTGBD+LC can shorten the operative duration in patients with moderate to severe AC, which might improve surgical outcomes in elderly patients with comorbidities, and elevated CRP values predicted a prolonged operation after PTGBD. labels: #Aged#Aged, 80 and over#C-Reactive Protein#Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic#Cholecystitis, Acute#Combined Modality Therapy#Drainage#Elective Surgical Procedures#Female#Gallbladder#Humans#Liver#Male#Middle Aged#Operative Time#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Treatment Outcome'
b'RATIONALE: More mature or older women are more likely to undergo in vitro fertilization and embryo implant. These women have a greater chance of receiving ergonovine therapy because of a suspected abortion. We present this case report to call attention to a latent lethal adverse effect in everyday obstetric practice using ergonovine. It requires more attention and close monitoring PATIENT CONCERNS:: We presented the case of a 38-year-old female patient with general weakness and mild chest tightness after ergonovine use.DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed as transient sick sinus syndrome and complete atrioventricular block with junctional escape rhythm after diagnostic work up.INTERVENTIONS: Conservative treatment with discontinuation of ergonovine and bed rest.OUTCOMES: Her sinus rhythm returned to normal the day after ergonovine was discontinued. The patient remained symptom-free since recovery of her sinus rhythm.LESSONS: Ergonovine may cause symptomatic and lethal bradyarrhythmia. Withdrawal of the causative medication and adequate supportive care can lead to a favorable outcome in these patients. More related cases should be reported. Further evaluation for treatment and prognosis are necessary. labels: #Adult#Atrioventricular Block#Bed Rest#Conservative Treatment#Ergonovine#Female#Humans#Oxytocics#Sick Sinus Syndrome#Treatment Outcome'
b'This protocol is an extension to: Nat. Protoc. 8, 491-500 (2013); doi:10.1038/nprot.2013.020; published online 14 February 2013RBDmap is a method for identifying, in a proteome-wide manner, the regions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) engaged in native interactions with RNA. In brief, cells are irradiated with UV light to induce protein-RNA cross-links. Following stringent denaturing washes, the resulting covalently linked protein-RNA complexes are purified with oligo(dT) magnetic beads. After elution, RBPs are subjected to partial proteolysis, in which the protein regions still bound to the RNA and those released to the supernatant are separated by a second oligo(dT) selection. After sample preparation and mass-spectrometric analysis, peptide intensity ratios between the RNA-bound and released fractions are used to determine the RNA-binding regions. As a Protocol Extension, this article describes an adaptation of an existing Protocol and offers additional applications. The earlier protocol (for the RNA interactome capture method) describes how to identify the active RBPs in cultured cells, whereas this Protocol Extension also enables the identification of the RNA-binding domains of RBPs. The experimental workflow takes 1 week plus 2 additional weeks for proteomics and data analysis. Notably, RBDmap presents numerous advantages over classic methods for determining RNA-binding domains: it produces proteome-wide, high-resolution maps of the protein regions contacting the RNA in a physiological context and can be adapted to different biological systems and conditions. Because RBDmap relies on the isolation of polyadenylated RNA via oligo(dT), it will not provide RNA-binding information on proteins interacting exclusively with nonpolyadenylated transcripts. Applied to HeLa cells, RBDmap uncovered 1,174 RNA-binding sites in 529 proteins, many of which were previously unknown. labels: #Algorithms#Binding Sites#Gene Expression#HeLa Cells#Humans#Mass Spectrometry#Oligodeoxyribonucleotides#Protein Binding#Proteolysis#Proteomics#RNA, Messenger#RNA-Binding Motifs#RNA-Binding Proteins#Ultraviolet Rays'
b'We describe a sensitive, robust, high-throughput method for quantifying the ability of metastatic tumor cells to colonize a secondary organ. Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients, and successful colonization of the secondary organ is the rate-limiting step in the metastatic process; thus, experimental methods that can be used to interrogate the key factors required for this critical step are of great importance. The experimental metastasis assay we detail here includes tail-vein injection of cancer cells into the mouse and determination of the resulting secondary organ colonization, primarily in the lung, 10 d post dosing. This assay can be used to investigate factors that regulate metastatic colonization both at the tumor-cell-intrinsic level (via manipulation of the tumor cells before injection) and at the tumor-cell-extrinsic level (such as the tissue microenvironment, via the use of genetically modified (GM) mice or agents such as antibodies or drugs). Using this method, we have robustly screened more than 950 GM mouse lines to identify novel microenvironmental regulators of metastatic colonization. The experimental details discussed here include choosing of appropriate cell numbers, handling of the cells, selection of recipient animals and injection techniques. Furthermore, we discuss key experimental design considerations, including the choice of the method used to determine metastatic burden and statistical analysis of the results, as well as provide troubleshooting tips and identification of factors that contribute to experimental variability. labels: #Animals#Breast Neoplasms#CRISPR-Cas Systems#Cell Line, Tumor#Colorectal Neoplasms#Female#Gene Editing#High-Throughput Screening Assays#Humans#Injections, Intravenous#Lung Neoplasms#Melanoma, Experimental#Mice#Mice, Transgenic#Neoplasm Metastasis#Neoplasm Transplantation'
b'During 2014, 120,000 persons in the United States and Puerto Rico began treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (i.e., kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation) (1). Among these persons, 44% (approximately 53,000 persons) had diabetes listed as the primary cause of ESRD (ESRD-D) (1). Although the number of persons initiating ESRD-D treatment each year has increased since 1980 (1,2), the ESRD-D incidence rate among persons with diagnosed diabetes has declined since the mid-1990s (2,3). To determine whether ESRD-D incidence has continued to decline in the United States overall and in each state, the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, CDC analyzed 2000-2014 data from the U.S. Renal Data System and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. During that period, the age-standardized ESRD-D incidence among persons with diagnosed diabetes declined from 260.2 to 173.9 per 100,000 diabetic population (33%), and declined significantly in most states, DC, and Puerto Rico. No state experienced an increase in ESRD-D incidence rates. Continued awareness of risk factors for kidney failure and interventions to improve diabetes care might sustain and improve these trends. labels: #Adult#Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System#Diabetes Complications#Humans#Incidence#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Puerto Rico#Risk Factors#United States'
b'PROBLEM/CONDITION: Many rural residents work in the field of agriculture; however, employment in nonagricultural jobs also is common. Because previous studies in rural communities often have focused on agricultural workers, much less is known about the occupational exposures in other types of jobs in rural settings. Characterizing airborne occupational exposures that can contribute to respiratory diseases is important so that differences between rural and urban working populations can be assessed.REPORTING PERIOD: 1994-2011.DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: This investigation used data from the baseline questionnaire completed by adult rural residents participating in the Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS). The distribution of jobs and occupational exposures to vapor-gas, dust, and fumes (VGDF) among all participants was analyzed and stratified by farming status (current, former, and never) then compared with a cohort of urban workers from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Occupational exposure in the last job was assessed with a job-exposure matrix (JEM) developed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The COPD JEM assesses VGDF exposure at levels of none or low, medium, and high.RESULTS: The 1,699 KCRHS (rural) participants were more likely to have medium or high occupational VGDF exposure (43.2%) at their last job than their urban MESA counterparts (15.0% of 3,667 participants). One fifth (20.8%) of the rural participants currently farmed, 43.1% were former farmers, and approximately one third (36.1%) had never farmed. These three farming groups differed in VGDF exposure at the last job, with the prevalence of medium or high exposure at 80.2% for current farmers, 38.7% for former farmers, and 27.4% for never farmers, and all three percentages were higher than the 15.0% medium or high level of VGDF exposure for urban workers.INTERPRETATION: Rural workers, including those who had never farmed, were more likely to experience occupational VGDF exposure than urban workers.PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The occupational exposures of rural adults assessed using the COPD JEM will be used to investigate their potential association with obstructive respiratory health problems (e.g., airflow limitation and chronic bronchitis). This assessment might highlight occupations in need of preventive interventions. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Air Pollutants, Occupational#Cohort Studies#Dust#Female#Gases#Humans#Iowa#Male#Middle Aged#Occupational Diseases#Occupational Exposure#Occupations#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive#Rural Population#Surveys and Questionnaires#Urban Population#Young Adult'
b"Preliminary estimates of U.S. drug overdose deaths exceeded 60,000 in 2016 and were partially driven by a fivefold increase in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (excluding methadone), from 3,105 in 2013 to approximately 20,000 in 2016 (1,2). Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50-100 times more potent than morphine, is primarily responsible for this rapid increase (3,4). In addition, fentanyl analogs such as acetylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and carfentanil are being detected increasingly in overdose deaths (5,6) and the illicit opioid drug supply (7). Carfentanil is estimated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine (8). Estimates of the potency of acetylfentanyl and furanylfentanyl vary but suggest that they are less potent than fentanyl (9). Estimates of relative potency have some uncertainty because illicit fentanyl analog potency has not been evaluated in humans. This report describes opioid overdose deaths during July-December 2016 that tested positive for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or U-47700, an illicit synthetic opioid, in 10 states participating in CDC's Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) program.* Fentanyl analogs are similar in chemical structure to fentanyl but not routinely detected because specialized toxicology testing is required. Fentanyl was detected in at least half of opioid overdose deaths in seven of 10 states, and 57% of fentanyl-involved deaths also tested positive for other illicit drugs, such as heroin. Fentanyl analogs were present in>10% of opioid overdose deaths in four states, with carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl identified most frequently. Expanded surveillance for opioid overdoses, including testing for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, assists in tracking the rapidly changing illicit opioid market and informing innovative interventions designed to reduce opioid overdose deaths. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Benzamides#Drug Overdose#Female#Fentanyl#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#United States#Young Adult"
b'In 1988, the World Health Assembly launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) (1). Among the three wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. Since 2014, detection of WPV1 has been limited to three countries, with 37 cases in 2016 and 11 cases in 2017 as of September 27. The>99.99% decline worldwide in polio cases since the launch of the GPEI is attributable to the extensive use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in mass vaccination campaigns and comprehensive national routine immunization programs. Despite its well-established safety record, OPV use can be associated with rare emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (2). VDPVs can also emerge among persons with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can replicate for years in some persons with PIDs. In addition, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can emerge very rarely among immunologically normal vaccine recipients and their contacts in areas with inadequate OPV coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. This report updates previous summaries regarding VDPVs (3). During January 2016-June 2017, new cVDPV outbreaks were identified, including two in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (eight cases), and another in Syria (35 cases), whereas the circulation of cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria resulted in cVDPV2 detection linked to a previous emergence. The last confirmed case from the 2015-2016 cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Laos occurred in January 2016. Fourteen newly identified persons in 10 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs, and three previously reported patients in the United Kingdom and Iran (3) were still excreting type 2 iVDPV (iVDPV2) during the reporting period. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates that cannot be classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in 10 countries. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for new VDPV infections. labels: #Child#Child, Preschool#Disease Outbreaks#Female#Global Health#Humans#Immunocompromised Host#Infant#Male#Poliomyelitis#Poliovirus#Poliovirus Vaccine, Oral#Serotyping#Sewage#Vaccines, Attenuated'
b"Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe pediatric diarrhea globally, estimated to have caused 120,000 deaths among children aged<5 years in sub-Saharan Africa in 2013 (1). In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended rotavirus vaccination for all infants worldwide (2). Two rotavirus vaccines are currently licensed globally: the monovalent Rotarix vaccine (RV1, GlaxoSmithKline; 2-dose series) and the pentavalent RotaTeq vaccine (RV5, Merck; 3-dose series). This report describes progress of rotavirus vaccine introduction (3), coverage (using estimates from WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF]) (4), and impact on pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations in the WHO African Region. By December 2016, 31 (66%) of 47 countries in the WHO African Region had introduced rotavirus vaccine, including 26 that introduced RV1 and five that introduced RV5. Among these countries, rotavirus vaccination coverage (completed series) was 77%, according to WHO/UNICEF population-weighted estimates. In 12 countries with surveillance data available before and after vaccine introduction, the proportion of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations that were rotavirus-positive declined 33%, from 39% preintroduction to 26% following rotavirus vaccine introduction. These results support introduction of rotavirus vaccine in the remaining countries in the region and continuation of rotavirus surveillance to monitor impact. labels: #Africa#Child, Preschool#Feces#Humans#Immunization Programs#Immunization Schedule#Infant#Population Surveillance#Rotavirus#Rotavirus Infections#Rotavirus Vaccines#World Health Organization"
b'Vaccination is the most effective intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases in young children (1). Data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) were used to assess coverage with recommended vaccines (2) among children aged 19-35 months in the United States. Coverage remained \xe2\x89\xa590% for \xe2\x89\xa53 doses of poliovirus vaccine (91.9%), \xe2\x89\xa51 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91.1%), \xe2\x89\xa51 dose of varicella vaccine (90.6%), and \xe2\x89\xa53 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) (90.5%). Coverage in 2016 was approximately 1-2 percentage points lower than in 2015 for \xe2\x89\xa53 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), \xe2\x89\xa53 doses of poliovirus vaccine, the primary Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) series, \xe2\x89\xa53 HepB doses, and \xe2\x89\xa53 and \xe2\x89\xa54 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), with no changes for other vaccines. More direct evaluation of trends by month and year of birth (3) found no change in coverage by age 2 years among children included in combined data from the 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (born January 2012 through January 2015). The observed decreases in annual estimates might result from random differences in vaccination coverage by age 19 months between children sampled in 2016 and those sampled in 2015, among those birth cohorts eligible to be sampled in both survey years. For most vaccines, 2016 coverage was lower among non-Hispanic black* (black) children than among non-Hispanic white (white) children, and for children living below the federal poverty level\xe2\x80\xa0compared with those living at or above the poverty level. Vaccination coverage was generally lower among children insured by Medicaid (2.5-12.0 percentage points), and was much lower among uninsured children (12.4-24.9 percentage points), than among children with private insurance. The Vaccines for Children\xc2\xa7(VFC) program was designed to increase access to vaccines among children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Greater awareness and facilitating use of VFC might be helpful in reducing these disparities. Efforts should also be focused on minimizing breaks in continuity of health insurance and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during visits to health care providers. Despite the observed disparities and small changes in coverage from 2015, vaccination coverage among children aged 19-35 months remained high and stable in 2016. labels: #Child, Preschool#Ethnic Groups#Health Care Surveys#Humans#Immunization Schedule#Infant#Insurance, Health#Poverty#United States#Vaccination#Vaccines'
b'Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are photosynthetic, aquatic organisms found in fresh, brackish, and marine water around the world (1). Rapid proliferation and accumulation of potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria characterize one type of harmful algal bloom (HAB). HABs have the potential to cause illness in humans and animals (2,3); however, the epidemiology of these illnesses has not been well characterized. Statewide in 2015, a total of 139 HABs were identified in New York, 97 (70%) of which were confirmed through laboratory analysis; 77 independent beach closures were ordered at 37 beaches on 20 different bodies of water. To better characterize HAB-associated illnesses, during June-September 2015, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) implemented a pilot surveillance system in 16 New York counties. Activities included the collection of data from environmental HAB reports, illness reports, poison control centers, and syndromic surveillance, and increased outreach to the public, health care providers, and veterinarians. During June-September, 51 HAB-associated illnesses were reported, including 35 that met the CDC case definitions*; 32 of the cases occurred in humans and three in dogs. In previous years, New York never had more than 10 HAB-associated illnesses reported statewide. The pilot surveillance results from 16 counties during a 4-month period suggest that HAB-associated illnesses might be more common than previously reported. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Animals#Child#Child, Preschool#Disease#Dog Diseases#Dogs#Female#Harmful Algal Bloom#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#New York#Pilot Projects#Population Surveillance#Young Adult'
b"In 2016, 55 jurisdictions in 49 states and six cities in the United States* used immunization information systems (IISs) to collect and manage immunization data and support vaccination providers and immunization programs. To monitor progress toward achieving IIS program goals, CDC surveys jurisdictions through an annual self-administered IIS Annual Report (IISAR). Data from the 2013-2016 IISARs were analyzed to assess progress made in four priority areas: 1) data completeness, 2) bidirectional exchange of data with electronic health record systems, 3) clinical decision support for immunizations, and 4) ability to generate childhood vaccination coverage estimates. IIS participation among children aged 4 months through 5 years increased from 90% in 2013 to 94% in 2016, and 33 jurisdictions reported \xe2\x89\xa595% of children aged 4 months through 5 years participating in their IIS in 2016. Bidirectional messaging capacity in IISs increased from 25 jurisdictions in 2013 to 37 in 2016. In 2016, nearly all jurisdictions (52 of 55) could provide automated provider-level coverage reports, and 32 jurisdictions reported that their IISs could send vaccine forecasts to providers via Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging, up from 17 in 2013. Incremental progress was made in each area since 2013, but continued effort is needed to implement these critical functionalities among all IISs. Success in these priority areas, as defined by the IIS Functional Standards (1), bolsters clinicians' and public health practitioners' ability to attain high vaccination coverage in pediatric populations, and prepares IISs to develop more advanced functionalities to support state/local immunization services. Success in these priority areas also supports the achievement of federal immunization objectives, including the use of IISs as supplemental sampling frames for vaccination coverage surveys like the National Immunization Survey (NIS)-Child, reducing data collection costs, and supporting increased precision of state-level estimates. labels: #Child, Preschool#Health Care Surveys#Humans#Immunization#Immunization Programs#Infant#Information Systems#Program Evaluation#United States"
b'Natural sounds convey perceptually relevant information over multiple timescales, and the necessary extraction of multi-timescale information requires the auditory system to work over distinct ranges. The simplest hypothesis suggests that temporal modulations are encoded in an equivalent manner within a reasonable intermediate range. We show that the human auditory system selectively and preferentially tracks acoustic dynamics concurrently at 2 timescales corresponding to the neurophysiological theta band (4-7 Hz) and gamma band ranges (31-45 Hz) but, contrary to expectation, not at the timescale corresponding to alpha (8-12 Hz), which has also been found to be related to auditory perception. Listeners heard synthetic acoustic stimuli with temporally modulated structures at 3 timescales (approximately 190-, approximately 100-, and approximately 30-ms modulation periods) and identified the stimuli while undergoing magnetoencephalography recording. There was strong intertrial phase coherence in the theta band for stimuli of all modulation rates and in the gamma band for stimuli with corresponding modulation rates. The alpha band did not respond in a similar manner. Classification analyses also revealed that oscillatory phase reliably tracked temporal dynamics but not equivalently across rates. Finally, mutual information analyses quantifying the relation between phase and cochlear-scaled correlations also showed preferential processing in 2 distinct regimes, with the alpha range again yielding different patterns. The results support the hypothesis that the human auditory system employs (at least) a 2-timescale processing mode, in which lower and higher perceptual sampling scales are segregated by an intermediate temporal regime in the alpha band that likely reflects different underlying computations. labels: #Acoustic Stimulation#Auditory Perception#Behavior#Biomarkers#Electroencephalography#Evoked Potentials, Auditory#Female#Gamma Rhythm#Humans#Male#Nervous System Physiological Phenomena#Theta Rhythm#Time Factors#Young Adult'
b'Divergence of upstream regulatory pathways of the transcription factor Doublesex (Dsx) serves as a basis for evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in animals. However, little is known about the regulation of Dsx in environmental sex determination. In the crustacean Daphnia magna, environmental sex determination is implemented by male-specific expression of the Dsx ortholog, Dsx1. Transcriptional regulation of Dsx1 comprises at least three phases during embryogenesis: non-sex-specific initiation, male-specific up-regulation, and its maintenance. Herein, we demonstrate that the male-specific up-regulation is controlled by the bZIP transcription factor, Vrille (Vri), an ortholog of the circadian clock genes-Drosophila Vri and mammalian E4BP4/NFIL3. Sequence analysis of the Dsx1 promoter/enhancer revealed a conserved element among two Daphnia species (D. magna and D. pulex), which contains a potential enhancer harboring a consensus Vri binding site overlapped with a consensus Dsx binding site. Besides non-sex-specific expression of Vri in late embryos, we found male-specific expression in early gastrula before the Dsx1 up-regulation phase begins. Knockdown of Vri in male embryos showed reduction of Dsx1 expression. In addition, transient overexpression of Vri in early female embryos up-regulated the expression of Dsx1 and induced male-specific trait. Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas9 disrupted the enhancer on genome in males, which led to the reduction of Dsx1 expression. These results indicate that Vri was co-opted as a transcriptional activator of Dsx1 in environmental sex determination of D. magna. The data suggests the remarkably plastic nature of gene regulatory network in sex determination. labels: #Animals#Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors#CRISPR-Cas Systems#Cloning, Molecular#DNA-Binding Proteins#Daphnia#Enhancer Elements, Genetic#Female#Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental#Gene Regulatory Networks#Genetic Loci#Genotyping Techniques#Male#Promoter Regions, Genetic#Sequence Analysis, DNA#Sex Determination Processes'
b'Several conditions associated with reduced gastric acid secretion confer an altered risk of developing a gastric malignancy. Helicobacter pylori-induced atrophic gastritis predisposes to gastric adenocarcinoma, autoimmune atrophic gastritis is a precursor of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours, whereas proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use does not affect stomach cancer risk. We hypothesised that each of these conditions was associated with specific alterations in the gastric microbiota and that this influenced subsequent tumour risk. 95 patients (in groups representing normal stomach, PPI treated, H. pylori gastritis, H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis and autoimmune atrophic gastritis) were selected from a cohort of 1400. RNA extracted from gastric corpus biopsies was analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing (MiSeq). Samples from normal stomachs and patients treated with PPIs demonstrated similarly high microbial diversity. Patients with autoimmune atrophic gastritis also exhibited relatively high microbial diversity, but with samples dominated by Streptococcus. H. pylori colonisation was associated with decreased microbial diversity and reduced complexity of co-occurrence networks. H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis resulted in lower bacterial abundances and diversity, whereas autoimmune atrophic gastritis resulted in greater bacterial abundance and equally high diversity compared to normal stomachs. Pathway analysis suggested that glucose-6-phospahte1-dehydrogenase and D-lactate dehydrogenase were over represented in H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis versus autoimmune atrophic gastritis, and that both these groups showed increases in fumarate reductase. Autoimmune and H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis were associated with different gastric microbial profiles. PPI treated patients showed relatively few alterations in the gastric microbiota compared to healthy subjects. labels: #Achlorhydria#Adult#Aged#Autoimmune Diseases#Cluster Analysis#Cohort Studies#England#Female#Gastric Mucosa#Gastritis, Atrophic#Gastrointestinal Microbiome#Helicobacter Infections#Helicobacter pylori#Hospitals, University#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Proton Pump Inhibitors#Risk#Stomach Neoplasms'
b'Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Despite recent developments in norovirus propagation in cell culture, these viruses are still challenging to grow routinely. Moreover, little is known on how norovirus infects the host cells, except that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are important binding factors for infection and cell entry. Antibodies that bind at the HBGA pocket and block attachment to HBGAs are believed to neutralize the virus. However, additional neutralization epitopes elsewhere on the capsid likely exist and impeding the intrinsic structural dynamics of the capsid could be equally important. In the current study, we investigated a panel of Nanobodies in order to probe functional epitopes that could trigger capsid rearrangement and/ or interfere with HBGA binding interactions. The precise binding sites of six Nanobodies (Nano-4, Nano-14, Nano-26, Nano-27, Nano-32, and Nano-42) were identified using X-ray crystallography. We showed that these Nanobodies bound on the top, side, and bottom of the norovirus protruding domain. The impact of Nanobody binding on norovirus capsid morphology was analyzed using electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. We discovered that distinct Nanobody epitopes were associated with varied changes in particle structural integrity and assembly. Interestingly, certain Nanobody-induced capsid morphological changes lead to the capsid protein degradation and viral RNA exposure. Moreover, Nanobodies employed multiple inhibition mechanisms to prevent norovirus attachment to HBGAs, which included steric obstruction (Nano-14), allosteric interference (Nano-32), and violation of normal capsid morphology (Nano-26 and Nano-85). Finally, we showed that two Nanobodies (Nano-26 and Nano-85) not only compromised capsid integrity and inhibited VLPs attachment to HBGAs, but also recognized a broad panel of norovirus genotypes with high affinities. Consequently, Nano-26 and Nano-85 have a great potential to function as novel therapeutic agents against human noroviruses. labels: #Antibodies, Neutralizing#Antibody Affinity#Antiviral Agents#Binding Sites, Antibody#Binding, Competitive#Blood Group Antigens#Capsid#Capsid Proteins#Cross Reactions#Crystallography, X-Ray#Dynamic Light Scattering#Epitopes#Kinetics#Microscopy, Electron, Transmission#Models, Molecular#Norovirus#Protein Conformation#Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs#Single-Domain Antibodies#Thermodynamics'
b'OBJECTIVES: To identify groups at risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, patterns of antimicrobial resistance, and the proportion of patients with MRSA infections but no history of recent hospitalisation.DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Case series of 39 231 patients with S. aureus isolates from specimens processed by the Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD) public pathology provider during 2008-2014.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of MRSA infections among people with S. aureus isolates; antimicrobial susceptibility of MRSA isolates; origin of MRSA infections (community- or health care-associated); demographic factors associated with community-associated MRSA infections.RESULTS: There were 71 736 S. aureus-positive specimens during the study period and MRSA was isolated from 19.3% of first positive specimens. Most patients (56.9%) from whom MRSA was isolated had not been admitted to a public hospital in the past year. Multiple regression identified that patients with community-associated MRSA were more likely to be younger (under 40), Indigenous Australians (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% CI, 2.3-2.8), or a resident of an aged care facility (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.8-5.8). The proportion of MRSA isolates that included the dominant multi-resistant strain (AUS-2/3-like) declined from 29.6% to 3.4% during the study period (P<0.001), as did the rates of hospital origin MRSA in two of the major hospitals in the region.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MRSA in the HNELHD region decreased during the study period, and was predominantly acquired in the community, particularly by young people, Indigenous Australians, and residents of aged care facilities. While the dominance of the multi-resistant strain decreased, new strategies for controlling infections in the community are needed to reduce the prevalence of non-multi-resistant strains. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Age Distribution#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Child#Child, Preschool#Community-Acquired Infections#Female#Hospitals, Public#Humans#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Male#Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#New South Wales#Oceanic Ancestry Group#Public Health#Regression Analysis#Seasons#Sex Distribution#Staphylococcal Infections#Young Adult'
b'OBJECTIVES: To describe trends in the age-specific incidence of serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Australia, 1999-2015.DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Analysis in February 2017 of de-identified notification data from the Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System of all notifications of IMD in Australia with a recorded diagnosis date during 1999-2015.Major outcomes: IMD notification rates in Australia, 1999-2015, by age, serogroup, Indigenous status, and region.RESULTS: The incidence of meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) disease declined progressively from 1.52 cases per 100 000 population in 2001 to 0.47 per 100 000 in 2015. During 2006-2015, MenB accounted for 81% of IMD cases with a known serogroup; its highest incidence was among infants under 12 months of age (11.1 [95% CI, 9.81-12.2] per 100 000), children aged 1-4 years (2.82 [95% CI, 2.52-3.15]per 100 000), and adolescents aged 15-19 years (2.40 [95% CI, 2.16-2.67] per 100 000). Among the 473 infants under 2 years of age with MenB, 43% were under 7 months and 69% under 12 months of age. The incidence of meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) disease prior to the introduction of the MenC vaccine in 2003 was much lower in infants than for MenB (2.60 cases per 100 000), the rate peaking in people aged 15-19 years (3.32 per 100 000); the overall case fatality rate was also higher (MenC, 8%; MenB, 4%). The incidence of MenB disease was significantly higher among Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australians during 2006-2015 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 3.8; 95% CI, 3.3-4.5).CONCLUSIONS: Based on disease incidence at its current low endemic levels, priority at risk age/population groups for MenB vaccination include all children between 2 months and 5 years of age, Indigenous children under 10 years of age, and all adolescents aged 15-19 years. Given marked variation in meningococcal disease trends over time, close scrutiny of current epidemiologic data is essential. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Age Distribution#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Australia#Child#Child, Preschool#Epidemiological Monitoring#Female#Humans#Incidence#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Male#Meningitis, Meningococcal#Meningococcal Vaccines#Middle Aged#Neisseria meningitidis#Oceanic Ancestry Group#Serogroup#Vaccination#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: Persistent low-level hemolysis (LLH) during continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support is associated with subsequent thrombosis. Free hemoglobin from ongoing hemolysis scavenges nitric oxide (NO) to create an NO deficiency which can augment platelet function leading to a prothrombotic state. The phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, potentiates NO signaling to inhibit platelet function. Accordingly, we investigated the association of sildenafil administration and thrombotic events in patients with LLH during Heart Mate II support.METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-center review of all patients implanted with a Heart Mate II who survived to discharge (n=144). LLH was defined by a discharge lactate dehydrogenase level of 400 to 700 U/L. Patients were categorized as (1) LLH not on sildenafil, (2) LLH on sildenafil, (3) no LLH not on sildenafil, and (4) no LLH on sildenafil. Age, sex, platelet count, and mean platelet volume were similar between groups. Seventeen patients had either device thrombosis or ischemic stroke. Presence of LLH was associated with a greater risk of thrombosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 15; 95% confidence interval, 4.5-50;P<0.001 versus no LLH, not on sildenafil). This risk was reduced in patients with LLH on sildenafil (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-16.1;P=0.61). Device thrombosis and ischemic stroke were associated with an increase in mean platelet volume (9.6\xc2\xb10.5 to 10.9\xc2\xb10.8 fL,P<0.001). Patients with LLH not on sildenafil had a greater increase in mean platelet volume in comparison to those with LLH on sildenafil (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil is associated with reduced device thrombosis and ischemic stroke during ongoing LLH on Heart Mate II support. labels: #Brain Ischemia#Chi-Square Distribution#Disease-Free Survival#Heart Failure#Heart-Assist Devices#Hemolysis#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Mean Platelet Volume#Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors#Proportional Hazards Models#Prosthesis Design#Protective Factors#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sildenafil Citrate#Stroke#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome'
b"BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1) is a progressive, monogenic motor neuron disease with an onset during infancy that results in failure to achieve motor milestones and in death or the need for mechanical ventilation by 2 years of age. We studied functional replacement of the mutated gene encoding survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) in this disease.METHODS: Fifteen patients with SMA1 received a single dose of intravenous adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying SMN complementary DNA encoding the missing SMN protein. Three of the patients received a low dose (6.7\xc3\x971013vg per kilogram of body weight), and 12 received a high dose (2.0\xc3\x971014vg per kilogram). The primary outcome was safety. The secondary outcome was the time until death or the need for permanent ventilatory assistance. In exploratory analyses, we compared scores on the CHOP INTEND (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders) scale of motor function (ranging from 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating better function) in the two cohorts and motor milestones in the high-dose cohort with scores in studies of the natural history of the disease (historical cohorts).RESULTS: As of the data cutoff on August 7, 2017, all 15 patients were alive and event-free at 20 months of age, as compared with a rate of survival of 8% in a historical cohort. In the high-dose cohort, a rapid increase from baseline in the score on the CHOP INTEND scale followed gene delivery, with an increase of 9.8 points at 1 month and 15.4 points at 3 months, as compared with a decline in this score in a historical cohort. Of the 12 patients who had received the high dose, 11 sat unassisted, 9 rolled over, 11 fed orally and could speak, and 2 walked independently. Elevated serum aminotransferase levels occurred in 4 patients and were attenuated by prednisolone.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SMA1, a single intravenous infusion of adeno-associated viral vector containing DNA coding for SMN resulted in longer survival, superior achievement of motor milestones, and better motor function than in historical cohorts. Further studies are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of this gene therapy.

b"BACKGROUND: There is limited information regarding the effects of spaceflight on the anatomical configuration of the brain and on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces.METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare images of 18 astronauts' brains before and after missions of long duration, involving stays on the International Space Station, and of 16 astronauts' brains before and after missions of short duration, involving participation in the Space Shuttle Program. Images were interpreted by readers who were unaware of the flight duration. We also generated paired preflight and postflight MRI cine clips derived from high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of 12 astronauts after long-duration flights and from 6 astronauts after short-duration flights in order to assess the extent of narrowing of CSF spaces and the displacement of brain structures. We also compared preflight ventricular volumes with postflight ventricular volumes by means of an automated analysis of T1-weighted MRIs. The main prespecified analyses focused on the change in the volume of the central sulcus, the change in the volume of CSF spaces at the vertex, and vertical displacement of the brain.RESULTS: Narrowing of the central sulcus occurred in 17 of 18 astronauts after long-duration flights (mean flight time, 164.8 days) and in 3 of 16 astronauts after short-duration flights (mean flight time, 13.6 days) (P<0.001). Cine clips from a subgroup of astronauts showed an upward shift of the brain after all long-duration flights (12 astronauts) but not after short-duration flights (6 astronauts) and narrowing of CSF spaces at the vertex after all long-duration flights (12 astronauts) and in 1 of 6 astronauts after short-duration flights. Three astronauts in the long-duration group had optic-disk edema, and all 3 had narrowing of the central sulcus. A cine clip was available for 1 of these 3 astronauts, and the cine clip showed upward shift of the brain.CONCLUSIONS: Narrowing of the central sulcus, upward shift of the brain, and narrowing of CSF spaces at the vertex occurred frequently and predominantly in astronauts after long-duration flights. Further investigation, including repeated postflight imaging conducted after some time on Earth, is required to determine the duration and clinical significance of these changes.

b'BACKGROUND: Among adolescents with type 1 diabetes, rapid increases in albumin excretion during puberty precede the development of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, long-term risk factors for renal and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that adolescents with high levels of albumin excretion might benefit from angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins, drugs that have not been fully evaluated in adolescents.METHODS: We screened 4407 adolescents with type 1 diabetes between the ages of 10 and 16 years of age and identified 1287 with values in the upper third of the albumin-to-creatinine ratios; 443 were randomly assigned in a placebo-controlled trial of an ACE inhibitor and a statin with the use of a 2-by-2 factorial design minimizing differences in baseline characteristics such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes. The primary outcome for both interventions was the change in albumin excretion, assessed according to the albumin-to-creatinine ratio calculated from three early-morning urine samples obtained every 6 months over 2 to 4 years, and expressed as the area under the curve. Key secondary outcomes included the development of microalbuminuria, progression of retinopathy, changes in the glomerular filtration rate, lipid levels, and measures of cardiovascular risk (carotid intima-media thickness and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and asymmetric dimethylarginine).RESULTS: The primary outcome was not affected by ACE inhibitor therapy, statin therapy, or the combination of the two. The use of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a lower incidence of microalbuminuria than the use of placebo; in the context of negative findings for the primary outcome and statistical analysis plan, this lower incidence was not considered significant (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.94). Statin use resulted in significant reductions in total, low-density lipoprotein, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, in triglyceride levels, and in the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1, whereas neither drug had significant effects on carotid intima-media thickness, other cardiovascular markers, the glomerular filtration rate, or progression of retinopathy. Overall adherence to the drug regimen was 75%, and serious adverse events were similar across the groups.CONCLUSIONS: The use of an ACE inhibitor and a statin did not change the albumin-to-creatinine ratio over time.

b'BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder that is caused by an insufficient level of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that modifies pre-messenger RNA splicing of the SMN2 gene and thus promotes increased production of full-length SMN protein.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 3 efficacy and safety trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. The primary end points were a motor-milestone response (defined according to results on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination) and event-free survival (time to death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation). Secondary end points included overall survival and subgroup analyses of event-free survival according to disease duration at screening. Only the first primary end point was tested in a prespecified interim analysis. To control the overall type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical testing strategy was used for the second primary end point and the secondary end points in the final analysis.RESULTS: In the interim analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (21 of 51 infants [41%] vs. 0 of 27 [0%], P<0.001), and this result prompted early termination of the trial. In the final analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (37 of 73 infants [51%] vs. 0 of 37 [0%]), and the likelihood of event-free survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation, 0.53; P=0.005). The likelihood of overall survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.37; P=0.004), and infants with a shorter disease duration at screening were more likely than those with a longer disease duration to benefit from nusinersen. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Among infants with spinal muscular atrophy, those who received nusinersen were more likely to be alive and have improvements in motor function than those in the control group. Early treatment may be necessary to maximize the benefit of the drug.

b'The Pantanal is a hotspot for arbovirus studies in South America. Various medically important flaviviruses and alphaviruses have been reported in domestic and wild animals in the region. To expand the knowledge of local arbovirus circulation, a serosurvey for 14 Brazilian orthobunyaviruses was conducted with equines, sheep and free-ranging caimans. Sera were tested for specific viral antibodies using plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Monotypic reactions were detected for Maguari, Xingu, Apeu, Guaroa, Murutucu, Oriboca, Oropouche and Nepuyo viruses. Despite the low titers for most of the orthobunyaviruses tested, the detection of monotypic reactions for eight orthobunyaviruses suggests the Pantanal as a region of great orthobunyavirus diversity. The present data, in conjunction with previous studies that detected a high diversity of other arboviruses, ratify the Pantanal as an important natural reservoir for sylvatic and medically important arboviruses in Brazil. labels: #Alligators and Crocodiles#Animals#Animals, Domestic#Animals, Wild#Antibodies, Neutralizing#Antibodies, Viral#Brazil#Bunyaviridae Infections#Horse Diseases#Horses#Orthobunyavirus#Seroepidemiologic Studies#Sheep#Sheep Diseases'
b'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This risk is magnified by certain antiretrovirals, particularly the protease inhibitor ritonavir, but the pathophysiology of this connection is unknown. We postulated that a major mechanism for antiretroviral-associated cardiac disease is pathologic fibrosis linked to platelet activation with release and activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\xce\xb21, and that these changes could be modeled in a murine system. We also sought to intervene utilizing inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) as proof-of-concept for therapeutics capable of regulating TGF-\xce\xb21 signaling and collagen autophagy. We demonstrate decreased cardiac function indices, including cardiac output, ejection fraction and stroke volume, and prominent cardiac fibrosis, in mice exposed to pharmacological doses of ritonavir. Cardiac output and fibrosis correlated with plasma TGF-\xce\xb21 levels. Mice with targeted deletion of TGF-\xce\xb21 in megakaryocytes/platelets (PF4CreTgfb1flox/flox) were partially protected from ritonavir-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. Inhalation of low dose CO (250ppm), used as a surrogate for upregulation of inducible heme oxygenase/endogenous CO pathways, suppressed ritonavir-induced cardiac fibrosis. This occurred in association with modulation of canonical (Smad2) and non-canonical (p38) TGF-\xce\xb21 signaling pathways. In addition, CO treatment suppressed the M1 pro-inflammatory subset of macrophages and increased M2c regulatory cells in the hearts of RTV-exposed animals. The effects of CO were dependent upon autophagy as CO did not mitigate ritonavir-induced fibrosis in autophagy-deficient LC3-/- mice. These results suggest that platelet-derived TGF-\xce\xb21 contributes to ritonavir-associated cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis, extending the relevance of our findings to other antiretrovirals that also activate platelets. The anti-fibrotic effects of CO are linked to alterations in TGF-\xce\xb21 signaling and autophagy, suggesting a proof-of-concept for novel interventions in HIV/antiretroviral therapy-mediated cardiovascular disease. labels: #Animals#Blood Platelets#Carbon Monoxide#Cardiac Output#Echocardiography#Fibrosis#HIV Protease Inhibitors#Heart Diseases#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mice, Knockout#Myocardium#Ritonavir#Stroke Volume#Transforming Growth Factor beta1'
b'Asthma represents an episodic and fluctuating behavior characterized with decreased complexity of respiratory dynamics. Several evidence indicate that asthma severity or control is associated with alteration in variability of lung function. The pathophysiological basis of alteration in complexity of breathing pattern in asthma has remained poorly understood. Regarding the point that Rho-kinase is involved in pathophysiology of asthma, in present study we investigated the effect of Rho-kinase inhibition on complexity of respiratory dynamics in a guinea pig model of asthma. Male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 12 series of inhalations with ovalbumin or saline. Animals were treated by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (1mM aerosols) prior to each allergen challenge. We recorded respiration of conscious animals using whole-body plethysmography. Exposure to ovalbumin induced lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling including goblet cell hyperplasia, increase in the thickness of airways smooth muscles and subepithelial collagen deposition. Complexity analysis of respiratory dynamics revealed a dramatic decrease in irregularity of respiratory rhythm representing less complexity in asthmatic guinea pigs. Inhibition of Rho-kinase reduced the airway remodeling and hyperreponsiveness, but had no significant effect on lung inflammation and complexity of respiratory dynamics in asthmatic animals. It seems that airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling do not significantly affect the complexity of respiratory dynamics. Our results suggest that inflammation might be the probable cause of shift in the respiratory dynamics away from the normal fluctuation in asthma. labels: #Amides#Animals#Asthma#Disease Models, Animal#Guinea Pigs#Male#Plethysmography, Whole Body#Pyridines#Respiration#Respiratory Physiological Phenomena#rho-Associated Kinases'
b"This study aimed to explore an evidence-based nursing practice model of CRF management in hospitalized adult patients using the PARIHS evidence-implementation framework as the theoretical structure to provide guidance for similar nursing practices. The implementation of guideline evidence into clinical practice was conducted on the oncology and radiotherapy wards of a university-affiliated hospital. The process of integrating the guideline into the symptom management system of cancer patients was described. The impact of the evidence implementation was evaluated from three aspects: organizational innovations and outcome measures associated with nurses and with patients pre- and post-evidence implementation. During the implementation of evidence into practice on the wards, a nursing process, health education, a quality control sheet and CRF training courses were established. Through this implementation, compliance with evidence related to CRF increased significantly on the two wards, with that of ward B being higher than that of ward A. Regarding nursing outcomes, nursing knowledge, attitude and behavior scores with respect to CRF nursing care increased substantially after its application on the two wards, and the ward B nurses' scoring was higher than that of the ward A nurses. Qualitative analysis concerning the nurses suggested that leadership, patient concern about CRF management, and the need for professional development were the main motivators of the application, whereas the shortage and mobility of nursing human resources and insufficient communication between doctors and nurses were the main barriers. Additionally, most nurses felt more professional and confident about their work. Regarding patient outcomes, patient knowledge, attitude and behavior scores regarding CRF self-management increased significantly. Patients' post-implementation CRF was alleviated compared with the pre-implementation treatment cycle. The PARIHS framework may provide instructive guidance for the incorporation of evidence into practice, and the process-oriented framework might provide greater operational utility of the application. labels: #Adult#Attitude of Health Personnel#Evidence-Based Nursing#Fatigue#Female#Hospitalization#Humans#Middle Aged#Neoplasms#Oncology Nursing#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult"
b'Recent developments in high throughput genomic assays have opened up the possibility of testing hundreds and thousands of genes simultaneously. However, adhering to the regular statistical assumptions regarding the null distributions of test statistics in such large-scale multiple testing frameworks has the potential of leading to incorrect significance testing results and biased inference. This problem gets worse when one combines results from different independent genomic experiments with a possibility of ending up with gross false discoveries of significant genes. In this article, we develop a meta-analysis method of combining p-values from different independent experiments involving large-scale multiple testing frameworks, through empirical adjustments of the individual test statistics and p-values. Even though, it is based on various existing ideas, this specific combination is novel and potentially useful. Through simulation studies and real genomic datasets we show that our method outperforms the standard meta-analysis approach of significance testing in terms of accurately identifying the truly significant set of genes. labels: #Data Interpretation, Statistical#Empirical Research#Gene Expression#Genes#Genomics#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Meta-Analysis as Topic#Models, Statistical#Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis#Statistics as Topic'
b'BACKGROUND: Sleep-related problems are known risk factors for road accidents. However, very few studies have investigated the role played by insomnia and its components, and no data are available for a population of occupational drivers at risk, such as the truck driver category.OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence and impact of insomnia on motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and near-miss accidents (NMAs) in 949 truck drivers.DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.RESULTS: Insomnia affected 27.5% of the sample. Compared to other drivers, in the 3 years prior to the study, truck drivers with insomnia had reported a significantly higher number of MVAs; they had also reported a greater number of NMAs in the previous 6 months. After correction for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, short sleep duration, and other concurrent diseases, insomniac truck drivers had an almost two-fold risk of driving accidents (OR: 1.82, CI 95%:1.33-2.49) and a more than three-fold increased risk of near-miss accidents (OR: 3.35, CI95%:2.06-5.45) compared to non-insomniac drivers.CONCLUSION: Insomnia emerged as an independent risk factor for MVAs and NMAs. We strongly advise screening commercial drivers for signs and symptoms of insomnia in order to improve health and safety on the road. labels: #Accidents, Traffic#Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Automobile Driving#Cross-Sectional Studies#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Motor Vehicles#Occupational Diseases#Prevalence#Risk Factors#Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders#Surveys and Questionnaires#Young Adult'
b'Laboratory mice play a tremendous role in biomedical research in studies on immunology, infection, cancer and therapy. In the course of standardization of mice used in animal experiments, health monitoring constitutes an important instrument towards microbiological standardization. Infections with murine astroviruses (MuAstV) were only recently discovered and are, therefore, still relatively unknown in laboratory animal science. In rodent health monitoring viral infections within a population are commonly assessed in terms of specific antibodies by serological testing, as active infection and excretion of virus is often temporary and can easily be missed. So far only ongoing infections with astroviruses can be detected by PCR. The objective of this work was the development of a sensitive and specific MuAstV multiplex serological assay with a high-throughput capability to be used in routine testing of laboratory mice. Four different MuAstV proteins were recombinantly expressed and used as antigens. The best reacting antigen, the capsid spike protein VP27, was selected and tested with a panel of 400 sera of mice from units with a known MuAstV status. Assay sensitivity and specificity resulted in 98.5% and 100%, respectively, compared to RT-PCR results. Eventually this assay was used to test 5529 serum samples in total, during routine diagnostics at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg between 2015 and 2017. High sero-prevalence rates of up to 98% were detected in units with open cages indicating that the virus is highly infectious and circulates within these populations virtually infecting all animals regardless of the mouse strain. In addition, data collected from 312 mice purchased from commercial breeders and from 661 mice from 58 research institutes in 15 countries worldwide allowed the conclusion that MuAstV is widespread in contemporary laboratory mouse populations. labels: #Animals#Animals, Laboratory#Antibodies, Viral#Astroviridae#Astroviridae Infections#Mice#Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction#Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction#Sensitivity and Specificity#Seroepidemiologic Studies#Serologic Tests'
b'Adenocarcinoma of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a severe disease. Patients carrying EGFR mutations may benefit from EGFR targeted therapies (e.g.: gefitinib). Recently, it has been shown that sialidase NEU3 directly interacts and regulates EGFR. In this work, we investigate the effect of sialidase NEU3 overexpression on EGFR pathways activation and EGFR targeted therapies sensitivity, in a series of lung cancer cell lines. NEU3 overexpression, forced after transfection, does not affect NSCLC cell viability. We demonstrate that NEU3 overexpression stimulates the ERK pathway but this activation is completely abolished by gefitinib treatment. The Akt pathway is also hyper-activated upon NEU3 overexpression, but gefitinib is able only to decrease, and not to abolish, such activation. These findings indicate that NEU3 can act directly on the ERK pathway through EGFR and both directly and indirectly with respect to EGFR on the Akt pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a healthy mucosa cell line (with EGFR wild-type gene sequence) is slightly sensitive to gefitinib, especially in the presence of NEU3 overexpression, thus hypothesizing that NEU3 overexpressing patients may benefit from EGFR targeted therapies also in absence of EGFR point mutations. Overall, the expression of NEU3 may be a novel diagnostic marker in NSCLC because, by its ability to stimulate EGFR downstream pathways with direct and indirect mechanisms, it may help in the identification of patients who can profit from EGFR targeted therapies in absence of EGFR activating mutations or from new combinations of EGFR and Akt inhibitors. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Blotting, Western#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Membrane#Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Neuraminidase#Protein-Tyrosine Kinases#Quinazolines#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor#Signal Transduction'
b'Recent studies have highlighted the importance of local environmental factors to determine the fine-scale heterogeneity of malaria transmission and exposure to the vector. In this work, we compare a classical GLM model with backward selection with different versions of an automatic LASSO-based algorithm with 2-level cross-validation aiming to build a predictive model of the space and time dependent individual exposure to the malaria vector, using entomological and environmental data from a cohort study in Benin. Although the GLM can outperform the LASSO model with appropriate engineering, the best model in terms of predictive power was found to be the LASSO-based model. Our approach can be adapted to different topics and may therefore be helpful to address prediction issues in other health sciences domains. labels: #Algorithms#Animals#Anopheles#Humans#Malaria#Models, Statistical'
b"INTRODUCTION: Primary Sj\xc3\xb6gren's Syndrome (pSS) affects exocrine glands such as those producing the tear film, leading to dry and painful eyes, but is also associated with fatigue. The experience of fatigue in pSS, and its relationship with sicca symptoms, is poorly understood.METHODS: Twenty people diagnosed with pSS were recruited to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview about their symptoms experience. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.RESULTS: People with pSS described physical tiredness, mental fatigue and ocular fatigue. Mental fatigue was characterised by difficulties in attention, particularly, the ability to follow conversations and short-term memory problems. Participants linked their experience of fatigue to feeling of depression, frustration, irritation and anxiety, and therefore, fatigue was suggested to have had a large impact on their psychological well-being. People with pSS also described a range of ocular symptoms including pain, dryness, and itching, which were compounded by fatigue. For some, eye fatigue was pervasive, and daily activities involving the eyes such as reading, using the computer and driving were impaired. In some cases, the level of ocular discomfort was so severe it prevented sleep, which in turn impacted on general fatigue levels.CONCLUSIONS: People with pSS experience fatigue in a range of ways; physical, mental and ocular fatigue were described. Fatigue was suggested to exacerbate other ocular symptoms, posed serious physical limitations and caused psychological distress. Further research into the nature of fatigue and ocular symptoms in pSS is required. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Asthenopia#Fatigue#Female#Humans#Interviews as Topic#Middle Aged#Qualitative Research#Sjogren's Syndrome#Young Adult"
b'Wing morphology strongly affects flight performance which may consequently decline during feather moult due to the creation of feather gaps in the wing. Hence, the size and shape of moult-related wing gap may directly affect flight capacity. Here I examined the rare divergent primary moult sequence compared to the more common descendant moult sequence. In the divergent moult, the focus of primary moult is shifted from P1 (primary feather numbered descendantly) to another primary between P2 and P5, and then primaries are moulted in two concurrent waves, one descendant and the other ascendant. The result of this rare moult sequence is the splitting of the wing gap to two smaller gaps. Using a large moult database including 6,763 individuals of 32 Western Palaearctic passerine species, I found evidence of divergent moult only among 27 individuals of 12 species. I examined the speed of wing-feather moult for each individual that moulted divergently compared to a control group of individuals at the same moult stage which moulted following the common descending sequence. The results indicate that the sequence of primary moult and moult speed are correlated. Individuals which moulted divergently moulted their primaries with higher moult speed than descendant moulters. The applicability of this study is weakened by the dearth of moult data, thus making it difficult to draw conclusions for a large range of species. Ornithologists and bird ringers are therefore encouraged to collect more basic moult data during their field study. labels: #Animals#Feathers#Flight, Animal#Israel#Molting#Passeriformes#Songbirds#Time Factors#Wings, Animal'
b'Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone with many varied functions including regulation of blood calcium levels, cell proliferation, immunity, and reproduction in mammals. Vitamin D is activated by 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) and 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and is degraded by 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1). Vitamin D is transported by vitamin D-binding protein (group-specific component, GC) through the bloodstream and regulates cellular actions by binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR). In this study, we determined the expression and regulation of vitamin D-related molecules and the role of vitamin D at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs. Vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes CYP2R1, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1, vitamin D binding protein GC, and vitamin D receptor VDR were expressed in the endometrium in a pregnancy stage-specific manner as well as in conceptus and chorioallantoic tissues during pregnancy. VDR protein was localized to endometrial and trophoblastic cells. Concentrations of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, in the endometrial tissues were higher during early pregnancy than in mid- to late pregnancy, while plasma concentrations of calcitriol were highest during late pregnancy. Furthermore, calcitriol affected the expression of several genes related to conceptus implantation, vitamin D metabolism, calcium ion regulation, PG metabolism, and calcium-binding proteins in endometrial tissue explants. These results show that CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, GC, and VDR were expressed at the maternal-conceptus interface, endometrial calcitriol levels were regulated during pregnancy, and calcitriol modulated the expression of endometrial genes, suggesting that calcitriol may play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy by regulating endometrial function in pigs. labels: #25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase#Animals#Cholestanetriol 26-Monooxygenase#Chorioallantoic Membrane#Endometrium#Female#Gene Expression Regulation#Pregnancy#Receptors, Calcitriol#Swine#Vitamin D#Vitamin D-Binding Protein#Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase'
b'BACKGROUND: Besides inclusion in 1st line regimens against tuberculosis (TB), pyrazinamide (PZA) is used in 2nd line anti-TB regimens, including in the short regimen for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients. Guidelines and expert opinions are contradictory about inclusion of PZA in case of resistance. Moreover, drug susceptibility testing (DST) for PZA is not often applied in routine testing, and the prevalence of resistance is unknown in several regions, including in most African countries.METHODS: Six hundred and twenty-three culture isolates from rifampicin-resistant (RR) patients were collected in twelve Sub-Saharan African countries. Among those isolates, 71% were from patients included in the study on the Union short-course regimen for MDR-TB in Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Niger, and Rwanda PZA resistance, and the rest (29%) were consecutive isolates systematically stored from 2014-2015 in Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo. Besides national guidelines, the isolates were tested for PZA resistance through pncA gene sequencing.RESULTS: Over half of these RR-TB isolates (54%) showed a mutation in the pncA gene, with a significant heterogeneity between countries. Isolates with fluoroquinolone resistance (but not with injectable resistance or XDR) were more likely to have concurrent PZA resistance. The pattern of mutations in the pncA gene was quite diverse, although some isolates with an identical pattern of mutations in pncA and other drug-related genes were isolated from the same reference center, suggesting possible transmission of these strains.CONCLUSION: Similar to findings in other regions, more than half of the patients having RR-TB in West and Central Africa present concomitant resistance to PZA. Further investigations are needed to understand the relation between resistance to PZA and resistance to fluoroquinolones, and whether continued use of PZA in the face of PZA resistance provides clinical benefit to the patients. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Africa South of the Sahara#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Amidohydrolases#Antitubercular Agents#Child#Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Pyrazinamide#Rifampin#Tuberculosis, Pulmonary#Young Adult'
b"Panoramic views of natural environments provide visually navigating animals with two kinds of information: they define locations because image differences increase smoothly with distance from a reference location and they provide compass information, because image differences increase smoothly with rotation away from a reference orientation. The range over which a given reference image can provide navigational guidance (its 'catchment area') has to date been quantified from the perspective of walking animals by determining how image differences develop across the ground plane of natural habitats. However, to understand the information available to flying animals there is a need to characterize the 'catchment volumes' within which panoramic snapshots can provide navigational guidance. We used recently developed camera-based methods for constructing 3D models of natural environments and rendered panoramic views at defined locations within these models with the aim of mapping navigational information in three dimensions. We find that in relatively open woodland habitats, catchment volumes are surprisingly large extending for metres depending on the sensitivity of the viewer to image differences. The size and the shape of catchment volumes depend on the distance of visual features in the environment. Catchment volumes are smaller for reference images close to the ground and become larger for reference images at some distance from the ground and in more open environments. Interestingly, catchment volumes become smaller when only above horizon views are used and also when views include a 1 km distant panorama. We discuss the current limitations of mapping navigational information in natural environments and the relevance of our findings for our understanding of visual navigation in animals and autonomous robots. labels: #Animals#Ecosystem#Environment#Models, Theoretical#Photography#Spatial Navigation"
b'BACKGROUND: Despite the immense literature related to diverse human electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters, very few studies have focused on the reliability of these measures. Some of the most studied components (i.e., P3 or MMN) have received more attention regarding the stability of their main parameters, such as latency, amplitude or topography. However, spectral modulations have not been as extensively evaluated considering that different analysis methods are available. The main aim of the present study is to assess the reliability of the latency, amplitude and topography of event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the alpha band (10-14 Hz) observed in a cognitive task (visual oddball). Topography reliability was analysed at different levels (for the group, within-subjects individually and between-subjects individually).RESULTS: The latency for alpha ERD showed stable behaviour between two sessions, and the amplitude exhibited an increment (more negative) in the second session. Alpha ERD topography exhibited a high correlation score between sessions at the group level (r = 0.903, p<0.001). The mean value for within-subject correlations was 0.750 (with a range from 0.391 to 0.954). Regarding between-subject topography comparisons, some subjects showed a highly specific topography, whereas other subjects showed topographies that were more similar to those of other subjects.CONCLUSION: ERD was mainly stable between the two sessions with the exception of amplitude, which exhibited an increment in the second session. Topography exhibits excellent reliability at the group level; however, it exhibits highly heterogeneous behaviour at the individual level. Considering that the P3 was previously evaluated for this group of subjects, a direct comparison of the correlation scores was possible, and it showed that the ERD component is less reliable in individual topography than in the ERP component (P3). labels: #Adult#Alpha Rhythm#Brain#Cognition#Electroencephalography#Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization#Evoked Potentials#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Reproducibility of Results#Young Adult'
b'Neuroprosthetics research in amputee patients aims at developing new prostheses that move and feel like real limbs. Targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is such an approach and consists of rerouting motor and sensory nerves from the residual limb towards intact muscles and skin regions. Movement of the myoelectric prosthesis is enabled via decoded electromyography activity from reinnervated muscles and touch sensation on the missing limb is enabled by stimulation of the reinnervated skin areas. Here we ask whether and how motor control and redirected somatosensory stimulation provided via TMSR affected the maps of the upper limb in primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, as well as their functional connections. To this aim, we tested three TMSR patients and investigated the extent, strength, and topographical organization of the missing limb and several control body regions in M1 and S1 at ultra high-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, we analysed the functional connectivity between M1 and S1 and of both these regions with fronto-parietal regions, known to be important for multisensory upper limb processing. These data were compared with those of control amputee patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 12). We found that M1 maps of the amputated limb in TMSR patients were similar in terms of extent, strength, and topography to healthy controls and different from non-TMSR patients. S1 maps of TMSR patients were also more similar to normal conditions in terms of topographical organization and extent, as compared to non-targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation patients, but weaker in activation strength compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity in TMSR patients between upper limb maps in M1 and S1 was comparable with healthy controls, while being reduced in non-TMSR patients. However, connectivity was reduced between S1 and fronto-parietal regions, in both the TMSR and non-TMSR patients with respect to healthy controls. This was associated with the absence of a well-established multisensory effect (visual enhancement of touch) in TMSR patients. Collectively, these results show how M1 and S1 process signals related to movement and touch are enabled by targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation. Moreover, they suggest that TMSR may counteract maladaptive cortical plasticity typically found after limb loss, in M1, partially in S1, and in their mutual connectivity. The lack of multisensory interaction in the present data suggests that further engineering advances are necessary (e.g. the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prostheses) to enable prostheses that move and feel as real limbs. labels: #Adult#Aged#Amputation#Artificial Limbs#Brain Mapping#Electromyography#Female#Functional Neuroimaging#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Middle Aged#Motor Cortex#Movement#Muscle, Skeletal#Neuronal Plasticity#Skin#Somatosensory Cortex#Touch#Upper Extremity'
b'The presynaptic, high-affinity choline transporter is a critical determinant of signalling by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at both central and peripheral cholinergic synapses, including the neuromuscular junction. Here we describe an autosomal recessive presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome presenting with a broad clinical phenotype due to homozygous choline transporter missense mutations. The clinical phenotype ranges from the classical presentation of a congenital myasthenic syndrome in one patient (p.Pro210Leu), to severe neurodevelopmental delay with brain atrophy (p.Ser94Arg) and extend the clinical outcomes to a more severe spectrum with infantile lethality (p.Val112Glu). Cells transfected with mutant transporter construct revealed a virtually complete loss of transport activity that was paralleled by a reduction in transporter cell surface expression. Consistent with these findings, studies to determine the impact of gene mutations on the trafficking of the Caenorhabditis elegans choline transporter orthologue revealed deficits in transporter export to axons and nerve terminals. These findings contrast with our previous findings in autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy of a dominant-negative frameshift mutation at the C-terminus of choline transporter that was associated with significantly reduced, but not completely abrogated choline transporter function. Together our findings define divergent neuropathological outcomes arising from different classes of choline transporter mutation with distinct disease processes and modes of inheritance. These findings underscore the essential role played by the choline transporter in sustaining acetylcholine neurotransmission at both central and neuromuscular synapses, with important implications for treatment and drug selection. labels: #Animals#Animals, Genetically Modified#Atrophy#Axons#Brain#Caenorhabditis elegans#Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins#Child, Preschool#Female#HEK293 Cells#Homozygote#Humans#Infant#Male#Membrane Transport Proteins#Mutation, Missense#Myasthenic Syndromes, Congenital#Neurodevelopmental Disorders#Pedigree#Presynaptic Terminals#Protein Transport#Symporters'
b"Objectives: To describe the disease characteristics, continuous course and long-term outcome and to evaluate predictors of outcome in JIA in Greece.Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 17 years' prospective data on JIA. Outcome assessment included radiographic (modified Sharp-van der Heidje score), articular and extra-articular damage (Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index), functional ability (HAQ Disability Index), and the cumulative percentage time spent in a state of active disease and also in clinical remission off medication (CR) (according to Wallace's criteria).Results: One hundred and two (72 females) patients under regular follow-up were enrolled. The disease age of onset [mean (SD)] was 7.7 (4) years, the interval from onset to last visit was 17.2 (6.7) years and the patients' current age was 25 (5.9) years. At the last follow-up visit, 53 patients (52%) had disease activity, while 23.5% were in CR. The cumulative percentage time spent in a state of active disease and CR over the disease course was 52.6 and 17.8%, respectively. Polyarticular subtype of onset and longer disease activity during the first 5 years were independent predictors of worse outcome. Additional telephone-based interviews of 205 former JIA patients who had been lost to follow-up as adults were performed to extend the interpretation of our findings to a broader JIA population. Almost half (47.6%) of the total cohort of 307 patients were found to be in CR at the final evaluation and 69.7% had no disability.Conclusion: The available data indicate that JIA as a whole is a heterogeneous disease with significant variability in course and long-term outcome. labels: #Activities of Daily Living#Adolescent#Adult#Antibodies, Antinuclear#Antirheumatic Agents#Arthritis, Juvenile#Blood Sedimentation#C-Reactive Protein#Cohort Studies#Disease Progression#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Greece#Humans#Male#Peptides, Cyclic#Prognosis#Remission Induction#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors#Uveitis#Young Adult"
b'OBJECTIVE: Clinicians treating older patients with bipolar disorder with mood stabilizers need evidence from age-specific randomized controlled trials. The authors describe findings from a first such study of late-life mania.METHOD: The authors compared the tolerability and efficacy of lithium carbonate and divalproex in 224 inpatients and outpatients age 60 or older with bipolar I disorder who presented with a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode. Participants were randomly assigned, under double-blind conditions, to treatment with lithium (target serum concentration, 0.80-0.99 mEq/L) or divalproex (target serum valproate concentration, 80-99 \xce\xbcg/mL) for 9 weeks. Participants with an inadequate response after 3 weeks received open adjunctive risperidone. The authors hypothesized that divalproex would be better tolerated and more efficacious than lithium. Tolerability was assessed based on a measure of sedation and on the proportions of participants achieving target concentrations. Efficacy was assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).RESULTS: Attrition rates were similar for lithium and divalproex (14% and 18% at week 3 and 51% and 44% at week 9, respectively). The groups did not differ significantly in sedation. Participants in the lithium group tended to experience more tremor. Similar proportions of participants in the lithium and divalproex groups achieved target concentrations (57% and 56%, respectively). A longitudinal mixed model of improvement (change from baseline in YMRS score) favored lithium (change in score, 3.90; 97.5% CI=1.71, 6.09). Nine-week response rates did not differ significantly between the lithium and divalproex groups (79% and 73%, respectively). The need for adjunctive risperidone was low and similar between groups (17% and 14%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Both lithium and divalproex were adequately tolerated and efficacious; lithium was associated with a greater reduction in mania scores over 9 weeks. labels: #Aged#Antimanic Agents#Antipsychotic Agents#Bipolar Disorder#Double-Blind Method#Drug Therapy, Combination#Female#Humans#Lithium Carbonate#Male#Middle Aged#Risperidone#Treatment Outcome#Valproic Acid'
b'Objective\xc2\xa0To determine if circulating concentrations of vitamin D are causally associated with risk of cancer.Design\xc2\xa0Mendelian randomisation study.Setting\xc2\xa0Large genetic epidemiology networks (the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON), the Genetic and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), and the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortiums, and the MR-Base platform).Participants\xc2\xa070\xe2\x80\x89563 cases of cancer (22\xe2\x80\x89898 prostate cancer, 15\xe2\x80\x89748 breast cancer, 12\xe2\x80\x89537 lung cancer, 11\xe2\x80\x89488 colorectal cancer, 4369 ovarian cancer, 1896 pancreatic cancer, and 1627 neuroblastoma) and 84\xe2\x80\x89418 controls.Exposures\xc2\xa0Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2282679, rs10741657, rs12785878 and rs6013897) associated with vitamin D were used to define a multi-polymorphism score for circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations.Main outcomes measures\xc2\xa0The primary outcomes were the risk of incident colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma, which was evaluated with an inverse variance weighted average of the associations with specific polymorphisms and a likelihood based approach. Secondary outcomes based on cancer subtypes by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology were also examined.Results\xc2\xa0There was little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with risk of any of the seven cancers or their subtypes. Specifically, the odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations were 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.10) for colorectal cancer, 1.05 (0.89 to 1.24) for breast cancer, 0.89 (0.77 to 1.02) for prostate cancer, and 1.03 (0.87 to 1.23) for lung cancer. The results were consistent with the two different analytical approaches, and the study was powered to detect relative effect sizes of moderate magnitude (for example, 1.20-1.50 per 25 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D for most primary cancer outcomes. The Mendelian randomisation assumptions did not seem to be violated.Conclusions\xc2\xa0There is little evidence for a linear causal association between circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of various types of cancer, though the existence of causal clinically relevant effects of low magnitude cannot be ruled out. These results, in combination with previous literature, provide evidence that population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency and subsequent widespread vitamin D supplementation should not currently be recommended as a strategy for primary cancer prevention. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Case-Control Studies#Colorectal Neoplasms#Female#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Genetic Variation#Genome-Wide Association Study#Humans#Incidence#Lung Neoplasms#Male#Mendelian Randomization Analysis#Neoplasms#Neuroblastoma#Ovarian Neoplasms#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Prostatic Neoplasms#Risk Assessment#Vitamin D#Vitamin D Deficiency'
b"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and population impact of the national implementation of the Study of Technology to Accelerate Research (STAR) intervention for childhood obesity.METHODS: In the STAR cluster-randomized trial, 6- to 12-year-old children with obesity seen at pediatric practices with electronic health record (EHR)-based decision support for primary care providers and self-guided behavior-change support for parents had significantly smaller increases in BMI than children who received usual care. We used a microsimulation model of a national implementation of STAR from 2015 to 2025 among all pediatric primary care providers in the United States with fully functional EHRs to estimate cost, impact on obesity prevalence, and cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: The expected population reach of a 10-year national implementation is \xe2\x88\xbc2 million children, with intervention costs of $119 per child and $237 per BMI unit reduced. At 10 years, assuming maintenance of effect, the intervention is expected to avert 43\xe2\x80\x89000 cases and 226\xe2\x80\x89000 life-years with obesity at a net cost of $4085 per case and $774 per life-year with obesity averted. Limiting implementation to large practices and using higher estimates of EHR adoption improved both cost-effectiveness and reach, whereas decreasing the maintenance of the intervention's effect worsened the former.CONCLUSIONS: A childhood obesity intervention with electronic decision support for clinicians and self-guided behavior-change support for parents may be more cost-effective than previous clinical interventions. Effective and efficient interventions that target children with obesity are necessary and could work in synergy with population-level prevention strategies to accelerate progress in reducing obesity prevalence. labels: #Body Mass Index#Child#Cost-Benefit Analysis#Decision Making, Computer-Assisted#Early Medical Intervention#Electronic Health Records#Female#Humans#Male#Pediatric Obesity#United States"
b'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Growth is an important criterion to evaluate health in childhood and adolescence, especially in patients depending on special dietary treatment. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inherited disease of amino acid metabolism. Patients with PKU depend on a special phenylalanine-restricted diet, low in natural protein. The study aimed to evaluate growth, growth rate, and target height in 224 patients with PKU.METHODS: Retrospective, longitudinal analysis of standardized, yearly measurements of height, weight, and calculated growth rate (SD score [SDS]) of patients with PKU aged 0 to 18 years were conducted by using the national computerized CrescNet database. Inclusion was restricted to patients carried to term with a confirmed diagnosis of PKU or mild hyperphenylalaninemia determined by newborn screening and early treatment initiation.RESULTS: From birth to adulthood, patients with PKU were significantly shorter than healthy German children (height SDS at 18 years: -0.882 \xc2\xb1 0.108,P<.001). They missed their target height by 3 cm by adulthood (women:P= .02) and 5 cm (men:P= .01). In patients receiving casein hydrolysate during childhood, this was more pronounced compared with patients receiving amino acid mixtures (P<.001). Growth rate was significantly reduced during their first 2 years of life and in puberty (growth rate SDS: -1.1 to -0.5 m/year,P<.001 and -0.5;P<.02).CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosed, treated, and continuously monitored patients with PKU showed reduced height from birth onward. During the last 2 decades, this phenomenon attenuated, probably because of advances in PKU therapy related to protein supplements and special low-protein foods. labels: #Adolescent#Body Height#Body Weight#Child#Child Development#Child, Preschool#Cohort Studies#Dietary Proteins#Female#Germany#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Phenylketonurias#Retrospective Studies'
b'PARP inhibitors (PARPi) kill BRCA1/2-mutated cancers, which become resistant when DNA repair functions are restored.

b"With the aim to create a library of compounds with potential bioactivities by combining special characteristics of two important groups such as nucleobases and carbohydrates, twenty 1,4-disubstituted-triazole nucleosides were synthesized in good yields (80-94%) using the copper catalyzed 'Click' reaction between azido-modified pento- or hexopyranoses and alkyne-bearing pyrimidine or purine nucleobases. Structural elucidation was made with the assistance of spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, 1D-, 2D-NMR, and ESI-TOFMS. All the synthesized triazole nucleosides were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, Hep3B, PC-3) by using the MTT assay. Particularly, compounds 3a and 1b were identified as potential hits against Hep3B cell. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Cell Line, Tumor#Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic#Humans#Purine Nucleosides#Pyrans#Pyrimidine Nucleosides#Triazoles"
b'Vocal learning, the substrate of human language acquisition, has rarely been described in other mammals. Often, group-specific vocal dialects in wild populations provide the main evidence for vocal learning. While social learning is often the most plausible explanation for these intergroup differences, it is usually impossible to exclude other driving factors, such as genetic or ecological backgrounds. Here, we show the formation of dialects through social vocal learning in fruit bats under controlled conditions. We raised 3 groups of pups in conditions mimicking their natural roosts. Namely, pups could hear their mothers\' vocalizations but were also exposed to a manipulation playback. The vocalizations in the 3 playbacks mainly differed in their fundamental frequency. From the age of approximately 6 months and onwards, the pups demonstrated distinct dialects, where each group was biased towards its playback. We demonstrate the emergence of dialects through social learning in a mammalian model in a tightly controlled environment. Unlike in the extensively studied case of songbirds where specific tutors are imitated, we demonstrate that bats do not only learn their vocalizations directly from their mothers, but that they are actually influenced by the sounds of the entire crowd. This process, which we term "crowd vocal learning," might be relevant to many other social animals such as cetaceans and pinnipeds. labels: #Acoustics#Animals#Animals, Newborn#Auditory Perception#Chiroptera#Female#Learning#Vocalization, Animal'
b'BACKGROUND: Gonorrhoea is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections in England. Over 41,000 cases were recorded in 2015, more than half of which occurred in men who have sex with men (MSM). As the bacterium has developed resistance to each first-line antibiotic in turn, we need an improved understanding of fitness benefits and costs of antibiotic resistance to inform control policy and planning. Cefixime was recommended as a single-dose treatment for gonorrhoea from 2005 to 2010, during which time resistance increased, and subsequently declined.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a stochastic compartmental model representing the natural history and transmission of cefixime-sensitive and cefixime-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in MSM in England, which was applied to data on diagnoses and prescriptions between 2008 and 2015. We estimated that asymptomatic carriers play a crucial role in overall transmission dynamics, with 37% (95% credible interval CrI 24%-52%) of infections remaining asymptomatic and untreated, accounting for 89% (95% CrI 82%-93%) of onward transmission. The fitness cost of cefixime resistance in the absence of cefixime usage was estimated to be such that the number of secondary infections caused by resistant strains is only about half as much as for the susceptible strains, which is insufficient to maintain persistence. However, we estimated that treatment of cefixime-resistant strains with cefixime was unsuccessful in 83% (95% CrI 53%-99%) of cases, representing a fitness benefit of resistance. This benefit was large enough to counterbalance the fitness cost when 31% (95% CrI 26%-36%) of cases were treated with cefixime, and when more than 55% (95% CrI 44%-66%) of cases were treated with cefixime, the resistant strain had a net fitness advantage over the susceptible strain. Limitations include sparse data leading to large intervals on key model parameters and necessary assumptions in the modelling of a complex epidemiological process.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first estimates of the fitness cost and benefit associated with resistance of the gonococcus to a clinically relevant antibiotic. Our findings have important implications for antibiotic stewardship and public health policies and, in particular, suggest that a previously abandoned antibiotic could be used again to treat a minority of gonorrhoea cases without raising resistance levels. labels: #Anti-Bacterial Agents#Asymptomatic Infections#Bisexuality#Cefixime#Cephalosporin Resistance#Cost-Benefit Analysis#England#Gonorrhea#Health Policy#Homosexuality, Male#Humans#Male#Models, Biological#Neisseria gonorrhoeae'
b"BACKGROUND: Disinvestment (removal, reduction, or reallocation) of routinely provided health services can be difficult when there is little published evidence examining whether the services are effective or not. Evidence is required to understand if removing these services produces outcomes that are inferior to keeping such services in place. However, organisational imperatives, such as budget cuts, may force healthcare providers to disinvest from these services before the required evidence becomes available. There are presently no experimental studies examining the effectiveness of allied health services (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work) provided on weekends across acute medical and surgical hospital wards, despite these services being routinely provided internationally. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of removing weekend allied health services from acute medical and surgical wards using a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority research design.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trials between 1 February 2014 and 30 April 2015 among patients on 12 acute medical or surgical hospital wards spread across 2 hospitals. The hospitals involved were 2 metropolitan teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data from n = 14,834 patients were collected for inclusion in Trial 1, and n = 12,674 in Trial 2. Trial 1 was a disinvestment-specific non-inferiority stepped-wedge trial where the 'current' weekend allied health service was incrementally removed from participating wards each calendar month, in a random order, while Trial 2 used a conventional non-inferiority stepped-wedge design, where a 'newly developed' service was incrementally reinstated on the same wards as in Trial 1. Primary outcome measures were patient length of stay (proportion staying longer than expected and mean length of stay), the proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event, and the proportion with an unplanned readmission within 28 days of discharge. The 'no weekend allied health service' condition was considered to be not inferior if the 95% CIs of the differences between this condition and the condition with weekend allied health service delivery were below a 2% increase in the proportion of patients who stayed in hospital longer than expected, a 2% increase in the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days, a 2% increase in the proportion who had any adverse event, and a 1-day increase in the mean length of stay. The current weekend allied health service included physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, dietetics, social work, and allied health assistant services in line with usual care at the participating sites. The newly developed weekend allied health service allowed managers at each site to reprioritise tasks being performed and the balance of hours provided by each professional group and on which days they were provided. Analyses conducted on an intention-to-treat basis demonstrated that there was no estimated effect size difference between groups in the proportion of patients staying longer than expected (weekend versus no weekend; estimated effect size difference [95% CI], p-value) in Trial 1 (0.40 versus 0.38; estimated effect size difference 0.01 [-0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.31, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin), but the proportion staying longer than expected was greater with the newly developed service compared to its no weekend service control condition (0.39 versus 0.40; estimated effect size difference 0.02 [0.01 to 0.04], p = 0.04, CI was completely below non-inferiority margin) in Trial 2. Trial 1 and 2 findings were discordant for the mean length of stay outcome (Trial 1: 5.5 versus 6.3 days; estimated effect size difference 1.3 days [0.9 to 1.8], p<0.001, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: 5.9 versus 5.0 days; estimated effect size difference -1.6 days [-2.0 to -1.1], p<0.001, CI was completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between conditions for the proportion who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days in either trial (Trial 1: 0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.18, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin; Trial 2: -0.01 [-0.02 to 0.01], p = 0.62, CI completely below non-inferiority margin). There was no difference between conditions in the proportion of patients who experienced any adverse event in Trial 1 (0.01 [-0.01 to 0.03], p = 0.33, CI was both above and below non-inferiority margin), but a lower proportion of patients had an adverse event in Trial 2 when exposed to the no weekend allied health condition (-0.03 [-0.05 to -0.004], p = 0.02, CI completely below non-inferiority margin). Limitations of this research were that 1 of the trial wards was closed by the healthcare provider after Trial 1 and could not be included in Trial 2, and that both withdrawing the current weekend allied health service model and installing a new one may have led to an accommodation period for staff to adapt to the new service settings. Stepped-wedge trials are potentially susceptible to bias from naturally occurring change over time at the service level; however, this was adjusted for in our analyses.CONCLUSIONS: In Trial 1, criteria to say that the no weekend allied health condition was non-inferior to current weekend allied health condition were not met, while neither the no weekend nor current weekend allied health condition demonstrated superiority. In Trial 2, the no weekend allied health condition was non-inferior to the newly developed weekend allied health condition across all primary outcomes, and superior for the outcomes proportion of patients staying longer than expected, proportion experiencing any adverse event, and mean length of stay.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613001231730 and ACTRN12613001361796. labels: #After-Hours Care#Allied Health Personnel#Australia#Dietetics#Health Services#Hospital Units#Hospitalization#Humans#Length of Stay#Linear Models#Multilevel Analysis#Occupational Therapy#Patient Readmission#Physical Therapy Specialty#Social Work"
b"Stone cell content is thought to be one of the key determinants for fruit quality in pears. However, the molecular mechanism of stone cell development remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the stone cell clusters (SCCs) distribution and area in 'Dangshan Su' (with abundant stone cells) were higher as compared to 'Lianglizaosu' (low stone cell content bud sport of 'Dangshan Su') based on the histochemical staining, and the correlations of lignin content with stone cell content and SCC area was significant. The fruits of 'Dangshan Su' and 'Lianglizaosu' at three different developmental stages (23 and 55 days after flowering and mature) were sampled for comparative transcriptome analysis to explore the metabolic pathways associated with stone cell development. A total of 42444 unigenes were obtained from two varieties, among which 7203 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparison of the six transcriptomes. Specifically, many DEGs associated with lignin biosynthesis were identified, including coumaroylquinate 3-monooxygenase (C3H), shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD), as well as genes related to carbon metabolism, such as sorbitol dehydrogenase-like (SDH-like) and ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK). At the peak of the stone cell content (55 days after flowering), the expression level of these genes in 'Dangshan Su' was significantly increased compared with 'Lianglizaosu', indicating that these genes were closely related to stone cell development. We validated the transcriptional levels of 33 DEGs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The results were consistent with the transcriptome analysis, indicating the reliability of transcriptome data. In addition, subcellular localization analysis of three DEGs in lignin synthesis (PbC3H, PbF5H and PbPOD) revealed that these proteins are mainly distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of stone cell formation. labels: #Fruit#Gene Expression Profiling#Gene Expression Regulation, Plant#Genetic Association Studies#Lignin#Metabolic Networks and Pathways#Pyrus#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Sequence Analysis, DNA"
b'The nuclear genome harbours hundreds to several thousand copies of ribosomal DNA. Despite their essential role in cellular ribogenesis few studies have addressed intrapopulation, interpopulation and interspecific levels of rDNA variability in wild plants. Some studies have assessed the extent of rDNA variation at the sequence and copy-number level with large sampling in several species. However, comparable studies on rDNA site number variation in plants, assessed with extensive hierarchical sampling at several levels (individuals, populations, species) are lacking. In exploring the possible causes for ribosomal loci dynamism, we have used the diploid genus Anacyclus (Asteraceae) as a suitable system to examine the evolution of ribosomal loci. To this end, the number and chromosomal position of 45S rDNA sites have been determined in 196 individuals from 47 populations in all Anacyclus species using FISH. The 45S rDNA site-number has been assessed in a significant sample of seed plants, which usually exhibit rather consistent features, except for polyploid plants. In contrast, the level of rDNA site-number variation detected in Anacyclus is outstanding in the context of angiosperms particularly regarding populations of the same species. The number of 45S rDNA sites ranged from four to 11, accounting for 14 karyological ribosomal phenotypes. Our results are not even across species and geographical areas, and show that there is no clear association between the number of 45S rDNA loci and the life cycle in Anacyclus. A single rDNA phenotype was detected in several species, but a more complex pattern that included intra-specific and intra-population polymorphisms was recorded in A. homogamos, A. clavatus and A. valentinus, three weedy species showing large and overlapping distribution ranges. It is likely that part of the cytogenetic changes and inferred dynamism found in these species have been triggered by genomic rearrangements resulting from contemporary hybridisation. labels: #Asteraceae#Chromosomes, Plant#DNA, Ribosomal#Diploidy#Genetic Variation#In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence#Karyotyping#RNA, Ribosomal'
b'Purpose: Centripetal retinal degeneration in choroideremia (CHM) leads to early visual field restriction and late central vision loss. The latter marks an acute decline in quality of life but visual prognostication remains challenging. We investigated visual function in CHM by correlating best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), microperimetry and multimodal imaging.Methods: Fifty-six consecutive CHM patients attending Oxford Eye Hospital were examined with BCVA, 10-2 microperimetry, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence (AF). Microperimetry was repeated in 21 eyes and analyzed with Bland-Altman. Kaplan-Meier survival plots of eyes retaining 20/20 BCVA were created. Intereye symmetry was assessed.Results: Microperimetry coefficient of repeatability was 1.45 dB. Survival analysis showed an indistinguishable pattern between eyes (median survival 39 years). Macular sensitivity showed a similar decline in right and left eyes, with half-lives of 13.6 years. Zonal analysis showed faster decline nasal to the fovea. Intereye symmetry was more consistent for microperimetry sensitivity (r = 0.95, P<0.001) than BCVA (r = 0.42, P = 0.0006). Near normal foveal sensitivity was maintained when the fovea was at least 2500 \xce\xbcm from the advancing edge of AF.Conclusions: BCVA is a marker of central degeneration and can provide valuable information about the position of the remaining retina as well as a measure of the impact on daily living. Microperimetry represents the global macular region. Both visual functions showed a high degree of intereye symmetry, particularly in early stages, indicating the fellow eye can provide a suitable control for assessing interventions to one eye. The findings may help to tailor visual prognosis and interpret outcomes of trials. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Child#Choroideremia#Female#Fluorescein Angiography#Fundus Oculi#Genetic Therapy#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Multimodal Imaging#Tomography, Optical Coherence#Visual Acuity#Visual Field Tests#Visual Fields#Young Adult'
b'Purpose: To investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of ripasudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, using endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats.Methods: Endotoxin-induced uveitis was induced by footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ripasudil was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour before and after LPS injection. The aqueous humor was collected 24 hours after injection, and the infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were determined. Infiltrating cells in the iris ciliary body (ICB) and adherent leukocytes in retinal vessels were evaluated. The mRNA levels of IL-1\xce\xb2, IL-6, TNF-\xce\xb1, and MCP-1 in the retina and ICB were determined. A mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of ripasudil, and the expression of MCP-1 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-\xce\xbaB was analyzed.Results: Ripasudil significantly reduced infiltrating cells and protein exudation in the aqueous humor, as well as the number of infiltrating cells in the ICB and adherent leukocytes in retinal vessels in EIU. Additionally, the protein level of MCP-1 in the aqueous humor and mRNA levels of IL-1\xce\xb2, IL-6, TNF-\xce\xb1, MCP-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the ICB and retina were suppressed by ripasudil. The production of MCP-1 and nuclear translocation of NF-\xce\xbaB in RAW264.7 cells were also suppressed by ripasudil.Conclusions: The Rho/ROCK pathway plays a role in adhesion molecule expression and inflammatory cell infiltration in EIU, and ripasudil is a potent anti-inflammatory agent against ocular inflammatory diseases, including acute uveitis and possibly uveitic glaucoma. labels: #Animals#Aqueous Humor#Cells, Cultured#Cytokines#Disease Models, Animal#Endotoxins#Injections, Intraperitoneal#Isoquinolines#Male#Rats#Rats, Wistar#Retina#Sulfonamides#Uveitis#rho-Associated Kinases'
b'Purpose: To assess vitreous levels of inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins (NTs) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and elucidate their potential roles.Methods: A prospective study was performed on 50 vitreous samples obtained from patients with DR (n = 22) and the nondiabetic controls (n = 28). All patients were candidates for vitrectomy. Inflammatory cytokine and NT levels were determined with ELISA.

Similarly, the levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1\xce\xb2 (P<0.0001), IL-6 (P = 0.0005), IL-8 (P<0.0001), and TNF-\xce\xb1 (P<0.0001) were also higher in eyes with DR. Interestingly, inflammatory cytokine and NT levels, particularly TNF-\xce\xb1 (P<0.05), IL-8 (P<0.004), NT-3 (P = 0.012), NGF (P = 0.04), GDNF (P = 0.005), and CNTF (P = 0.002), were higher in eyes with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) than in eyes with active proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Cytokine stimulation of M\xc3\xbcller glia resulted in production of NTs, and GDNF treatment reduced photoreceptor cell death in response to inflammation and oxidative stress.Conclusions: Together, our study demonstrated that patients with DR have higher levels of both inflammatory cytokines and NTs in their vitreous. M\xc3\xbcller glia could be the potential source of NTs under inflammatory conditions to exert neuroprotection. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Biomarkers#Cells, Cultured#Cytokines#Diabetic Retinopathy#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Nerve Growth Factors#Prospective Studies#Vitreous Body'
b'BACKGROUND: The objective of our investigation is to study the relationship between the rs4939827 SNP in the SMAD7 gene, Mediterranean diet pattern and the risk of colorectal cancer.METHODS: We examined 1087 cases of colorectal cancer and 2409 population controls with available DNA samples from the MCC-Spain study, 2008-2012. Descriptive statistical analyses, and multivariate logistic mixed models were performed. The potential synergistic effect of rs4939827 and the Mediterranean diet pattern was evaluated with logistic regression in different strata of of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the genotype.RESULTS: High adherence to Mediterrenean diet was statistically significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk. A decreased risk for CRC cancer was observed for the CC compared to the TT genotype (OR\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.65 and 95% CI\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.51-0.81) of the rs4939827 SNP Also, we could show an association between the Mediterranean diet pattern (protective factor) and rs4939827. Although the decreased risk for the CC genotype was slightly more pronounced in subjects with high adherence to Mediterrenean diet, there was no statistically significant synergistic effect between genotype CC and adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern factors.CONCLUSION: The SMAD7 gene and specifically the allele C could be protective for colorectal cancer. An independent protective association was also observed between high adherence Mediterranean diet pattern and CRC risk. Findings form this study indicate that high adherence to Mediterranean diet pattern has a protective role for CRC cancer probably involving the Tumor Growth Factor- \xce\xb2 pathway in this cancer. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinogenesis#Case-Control Studies#Colorectal Neoplasms#Diet, Mediterranean#Female#Gene-Environment Interaction#Genetic Association Studies#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Genotype#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Smad7 Protein#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: The influence of e-cigarette use on smoking initiation is a highly controversial issue, with limited longitudinal data available for examining temporal associations. We examined e-cigarette use and its association with cigarette-smoking initiation at 1-year follow-up within a large cohort of Canadian secondary school students.METHODS: We analyzed data from students in grades 9-12 who participated in 2 waves of COMPASS, a cohort study of purposefully sampled secondary schools in Ontario and Alberta, Canada, at baseline (2013/14) and 1-year follow-up (2014/15). We assessed cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use at baseline and follow-up using self-completed surveys. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to examine correlates of past 30-day e-cigarette use at baseline and smoking initiation between waves within the longitudinal sample.RESULTS: Past 30-day e-cigarette use increased from 2013/14 to 2014/15 (7.2% v. 9.7%,p<0.001), whereas past 30-day cigarette smoking decreased slightly (11.4% v. 10.8%,p= 0.02). Among the 44 163 students evaluated at baseline, past 30-day e-cigarette use was strongly associated with smoking status and smoking susceptibility. In the longitudinal sample (n= 19 130), past 30-day use of e-cigarettes at baseline was associated with initiation of smoking a whole cigarette (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.68-2.66) and with initiation of daily smoking (adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41-2.28) at follow-up.INTERPRETATION: E-cigarette use was strongly associated with cigarette smoking behaviour, including smoking initiation at follow-up. The causal nature of this association remains unclear, because common factors underlying the use of both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may also account for the temporal order of initiation. labels: #Adolescent#Adolescent Behavior#Alberta#Behavior, Addictive#Cohort Studies#Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems#Female#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Ontario#Peer Group#Risk Factors#Self Report#Smoking#Tobacco Use Disorder'
b'BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have demonstrated that patients receiving bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) conduits during coronary artery bypass grafting have better long-term survival than those receiving a single internal mammary artery (SIMA), data on risk of repeat revascularization are more limited. In this analysis, we compare the timing, frequency, and type of repeat coronary revascularization among patients receiving BIMA and SIMA.METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 47 984 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries performed from 1992 to 2014 among 7 medical centers reporting to a prospectively maintained clinical registry. Among the study population, 1482 coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries with BIMA were identified, and 1297 patients receiving BIMA were propensity-matched to 1297 patients receiving SIMA. The primary end point was freedom from repeat coronary revascularization.RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 (IQR, 7.4-17.7) years. Patients were well matched by age, body mass index, major comorbidities, and cardiac function. There was a higher freedom from repeat revascularization among patients receiving BIMA than among patients receiving SIMA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.94];P=0.009). Among the matched cohort, 19.4% (n=252) of patients receiving SIMA underwent repeat revascularization, whereas this frequency was 15.1% (n=196) among patients receiving BIMA (P=0.004). The majority of repeat revascularization procedures were percutaneous coronary interventions (94.2%), and this did not differ between groups (P=0.274). Groups also did not differ in the ratio of native versus graft vessel percutaneous coronary intervention (P=0.899), or regarding percutaneous coronary intervention target vessels; the most common targets in both groups were the right coronary (P=0.133) and circumflex arteries (P=0.093). In comparison with SIMA, BIMA grafting was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality at 12 years of follow-up (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91];P=0.001), and there was no difference in in-hospital morbidity.CONCLUSIONS: BIMA grafting was associated with a reduced risk of repeat revascularization and an improvement in long-term survival and should be considered more frequently during coronary artery bypass grafting. labels: #Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Coronary Artery Bypass#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Male#Mammary Arteries#Middle Aged#Registries#Retrospective Studies#Survival Rate'
b'BACKGROUND: Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot provides symptomatic benefit and right ventricular (RV) volume reduction. However, data on the rate of ventricular structural and functional adaptation are scarce. We aimed to assess immediate and midterm post-PVR changes and predictors of reverse remoeling.METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (age \xe2\x89\xa516 y; mean age, 35.8\xc2\xb110.1 y; 38 male) undergoing PVR were prospectively recruited for cardiovascular magnetic resonance performed before PVR (pPVR), immediately after PVR (median, 6 d), and midterm after PVR (mPVR; median, 3 y).RESULTS: There were immediate and midterm reductions in indexed RV end-diastolic volumes and RV end-systolic volumes (RVESVi) (indexed RV end-diastolic volume pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 156.1\xc2\xb141.9 versus 104.9\xc2\xb128.4 versus 104.2\xc2\xb134.4 mL/m2; RVESVi pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 74.9\xc2\xb126.2 versus 57.4\xc2\xb122.7 versus 50.5\xc2\xb121.7 mL/m2;P<0.01). Normal postoperative diastolic and systolic RV volumes (the primary end point) achieved in 70% of patients were predicted by a preoperative indexed RV end-diastolic volume \xe2\x89\xa4158 mL/m2and RVESVi \xe2\x89\xa482 mL/m2. RVESVi showed a progressive decrease from baseline to immediate to midterm follow-up, indicating ongoing intrinsic RV functional improvement after PVR. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved (pPVR versus mPVR, 59.4\xc2\xb17.6% versus 61.9\xc2\xb16.8%;P<0.01), and right atrial reverse remodeling occurred (pPVR versus mPVR, 15.2\xc2\xb13.4 versus 13.8\xc2\xb13.6 cm2/m2;P<0.01). Larger preoperative RV outflow tract scar was associated with a smaller improvement in post-PVR RV/left ventricular ejection fraction. RV ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake predicted mortality (P=0.03) over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Significant right heart structural reverse remodeling takes place immediately after PVR, followed by a continuing process of further biological remodeling manifested by further reduction in RVESVi. PVR before RVESVi reaches 82 mL/m2confers optimal chances of normalization of RV function. labels: #Adult#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Heart Valve Prosthesis#Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Pulmonary Valve#Stroke Volume#Tetralogy of Fallot#Ventricular Remodeling'
b'OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and of paternal use before pregnancy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring while adjusting for familial risk for ADHD and indications of acetaminophen use.METHODS: Diagnoses were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry for 112\xe2\x80\x89973 offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 2246 with ADHD. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for an ADHD diagnosis by using Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use, we observed a modest association between any prenatal maternal use of acetaminophen in 1 (HR = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]0.96-1.19), 2 (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.07-1.38), and 3 trimesters (HR = 1.27; 95% CI 0.99-1.63). The HR for more than 29 days of maternal acetaminophen use was 2.20 (95% CI 1.50-3.24). Use for<8 days was negatively associated with ADHD (HR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-1.00). Acetaminophen use for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days was associated with ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95% CI 1.71-22.05). Paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen were similarly associated with ADHD.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was negatively associated with ADHD in offspring. Long-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was substantially associated with ADHD even after adjusting for indications of use, familial risk of ADHD, and other potential confounders. labels: #Acetaminophen#Adolescent#Analgesics, Non-Narcotic#Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity#Child#Child, Preschool#Cohort Studies#Drug Administration Schedule#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Norway#Pregnancy#Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects#Prospective Studies#Registries#Risk Factors#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b'BACKGROUND: Despite data suggesting safety and efficacy in ulcerative colitis patients treated with inpatient infliximab, prior studies did not focus on patients with extensive colitis, the group at highest risk for requiring surgery.METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective study (2008-2015) of consecutive patients who required admission because of severe extensive ulcerative colitis defined by preoperative symptoms and computed tomography scans and postoperative histology. Patients admitted for high-dose steroids were compared with steroid refractory inpatients provided with one or two infusions of infliximab. The primary study outcome was colectomy rates; secondary outcomes included mean length of stay and 60-d complication rates.RESULTS: A total of 174 patients required admission with steroids for extensive ulcerative colitis. Of these, 19 (10%) also received infliximab. Among the subjects treated with infliximab, 15 (78%) required total colectomy during that admission versus 81 (52%) who received steroids alone (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.03). Postoperative readmission rates, surgical-site infections, return to the operating room, and all-complication rates were similar between the cohorts (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05).CONCLUSIONS: For steroid refractory extensive ulcerative colitis, inpatient infliximab did not lower colectomy rates or increase postoperative complications compared with patients treated with steroids alone. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Anti-Inflammatory Agents#Colectomy#Colitis, Ulcerative#Combined Modality Therapy#Female#Gastrointestinal Agents#Hospitalization#Humans#Infliximab#Infusions, Intravenous#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Steroids#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: The liver has unique anatomy in that most blood flow to normal hepatocytes is derived from the portal venous system, whereas liver tumors obtain their nutrient blood supply exclusively from the hepatic artery. The focused arterial delivery of anticancer agents to liver tumors has been performed for decades; however, preclinical models to standardize drug regimens and examine novel agents have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to establish preclinical hepatic artery infusion (HAI) models in a mouse and to evaluate the safety and delivery capability of the models.MATERIAL AND METHODS: C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were used to develop models of HAI via the hepatic artery (HA), superior pancreaticoduodenal artery (SPDA), or lienogastric artery (LGA). Success rates, distribution of perfusion, and associated morbidity and mortality were analyzed between groups.RESULTS: All three models were feasible and reproducible in mice, and there was no statistical difference on body weight change between models. The HA model had a 13.3% mortality from acute liver failure, and the SPDA model demonstrated duodenal and pancreatic toxicity. SPDA and LGA routes had the highest success rates (96.7% and 91.4%, respectively) with low mortality, better drug delivery, and preserved physiologic liver function compared with the HA model.CONCLUSIONS: The optimal route of HAI was mouse breed specific; SPDA access in BALB/c mice, and the LGA access in C57BL/6 mice. The described techniques serve as a reproducible platform for the identification and characterization of therapeutics for diverse metastatic liver tumors. labels: #Animals#Antineoplastic Agents#Cell Line, Tumor#Colonic Neoplasms#Female#Fluorouracil#Hepatic Artery#Infusions, Intra-Arterial#Liver Neoplasms#Liver Neoplasms, Experimental#Mice#Mice, Inbred BALB C#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Reproducibility of Results#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Hispanic ethnicity is associated with increased incidence of gallbladder disease. Additionally, ethnicity has been shown to be an outcome determinant in several conditions and procedures but has never been studied as a potential determinant of morbidity or mortality after laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy.METHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, patients who underwent cholecystectomy and related procedures were studied in Hispanic and non-Hispanic cohorts. Mortality and postoperative complication rates were calculated and adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities through multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Hispanics had decreased morbidity following cholecystectomy as compared to non-Hispanics on univariate analysis in combined, laparoscopic, and open cohorts (RR 0.64, P value<0.001; 0.68,<0.001; 0.77,<0.001, respectively). The reduction was not found to be statistically significant in multivariate analysis. A similar reduction was seen for mortality (RR 0.30,<0.001; 0.39,<0.001; 0.28,<0.001, respectively) which remained on multivariate analysis in both combined and open cohorts (RR 0.63, 0.008 and 0.48, 0.021, respectively). Additionally, the rates of several postoperative complications were found to be reduced in Hispanic patients. Though our study demonstrates a lower rate of established comorbidities for poor outcomes in Hispanics, after adjustment in multivariate analysis, the entirety of the reduced risk could not be accounted for.CONCLUSIONS: While the Hispanic cohort has an increased incidence in gallbladder disease as compared to non-Hispanics, the complication, morbidity, and mortality rates are lower in unadjusted analysis. With adjustment, morbidity was not statistically significant and mortality was only significant in combined and open cohorts. This suggests that increased incidence rates do not equate with worse outcomes, but Hispanic ethnicity may be associated with better outcomes. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Cholecystectomy#Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic#Databases, Factual#Female#Health Status Disparities#Hispanic Americans#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Postoperative Complications#United States#Young Adult'
b"BACKGROUND: Childhood sarcomas are rare and require complex interdisciplinary care including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The goal of this study was to determine if racial or ethnic disparities exist for pediatric sarcoma patients in the United States.METHODS: The United States' National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify patients aged 0-21 diagnosed with primary sarcomas from 1973 to 2012. Patients were considered by race and ethnicity. Survival curves were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.RESULTS: A total of 11,502 patients were included in this study. When stratified by race, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic patients were significantly more likely to present with advanced stage disease than white patients. White patients were more likely to receive radiation therapy than black and Hispanic patients (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.01). There was no significant difference between patients who underwent surgery (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.21). Overall survival was better for white patients than black or Hispanic ones. Despite the overall 5-year survival improvement during the study period (56.2%-70.3%), survival disparities between race and ethnicity have grown.CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic disparities do exist with respect to stage, treatment, and survival of these rare tumors. Black and Hispanic patients are presenting at more advanced stage and have overall worse survival. This survival disparity has widened over the past 4\xc2\xa0decades. labels: #Adolescent#Bone Neoplasms#Child#Child, Preschool#Combined Modality Therapy#Ethnic Groups#European Continental Ancestry Group#Female#Health Status Disparities#Healthcare Disparities#Humans#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Male#Retrospective Studies#SEER Program#Sarcoma#Soft Tissue Neoplasms#Survival Rate#United States#Young Adult"
b"BACKGROUND: Given concern for hernia mesh infection, surgeons often use biologic mesh which may provide reduced risk of infection but at the cost of decreased repair durability. We evaluated mesh coating to provide sustained release of antibiotics to prevent prosthetic mesh infection and also allow a durable repair.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cyclodextrin-based polymer was crosslinked onto multifilament polyester mesh and loaded with vancomycin (1.75\xc2\xa0mg/cm2). Pigs received modified meshes (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa06) or normal, untreated meshes (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa04), which were implanted into acute 10\xc2\xa0\xc3\x97\xc2\xa05 cm ventral hernia, then directly inoculated with 106\xc2\xa0colony-forming unit (CFU) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These were compared to animals receiving normal, uninfected mesh. All mesh was secured in an underlay bridge manner, and after 30\xc2\xa0d, the abdominal wall was removed for quantitative bacterial culture and biomechanical analysis.RESULTS: All animals survived 30\xc2\xa0d. All six animals with coated mesh cleared MRSA infection. The four control animals did not clear MRSA (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.005). Quantitative bacterial load was higher in standard mesh versus drug-delivery mesh group (2.34 \xc3\x97 104versus 80.9\xc2\xa0CFU/gm). These data were log10-transformed and analyzed by Welch's t-test (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.001). Minimum number of CFUs detectable by assay (300) was used instead of zero. Biomechanical analysis of controls (1.82\xc2\xa0N/mm infected; 1.71\xc2\xa0N/mm uninfected) showed no difference to the modified meshes (1.31\xc2\xa0N/mm) in tissue integration (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.15).CONCLUSIONS: We successfully prevented synthetic mesh infection in a pig model using a cyclodextrin-based polymer to locally deliver vancomycin to the hernia repair site and clearing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Polymer coating did not impact the strength of the hernia repair. labels: #Animals#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Cellulose#Cyclodextrins#Female#Hernia, Ventral#Herniorrhaphy#Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus#Polyesters#Prosthesis-Related Infections#Random Allocation#Staphylococcal Infections#Surgical Mesh#Swine#Treatment Outcome#Vancomycin"
b'BACKGROUND: Previous data indicate that patients who undergo surgery with a postgraduate year 3 (PGY-3) resident as the junior surgeon have a lower rate of recurrence compared with PGY-1 and PGY-2 after an open inguinal herniorrhaphy. Lower PGY level was also associated with increased operative time. We hypothesize that when controlling for surgeon, technique, and hernia type, the outcomes for inguinal herniorrhaphy are the same independent of PGY level.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all open unilateral inguinal hernia repairs done by residents who assisted the same senior surgeon at the Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System was performed.RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-two open unilateral inguinal hernia were identified: mean patient age\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa060.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa012.7\xc2\xa0y; mean body mass index\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa027.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa010.8\xc2\xa0kg/m2; American Society of Anesthesia III-IV\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa051%; and Nyhus type 2\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa044.7%, 3a\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa041.6%, and 3b\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa013.7%. Residents involved were PGY-1 (17.2%), PGY-2/3 (71.1%), and PGY-4/5 (11.7%). Postoperative complications for intern, junior (PGY-2 and PGY-3), and senior residents (PGY-4 and PGY-5) were 4%, 9%, and 6%, respectively (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.14). Compared to interns, junior residents finished the operation 3.9\xc2\xa0min faster (95% confidence interval = -7.5, -0.3). There was no time difference between interns and senior residents completing the operations after controlling for hernia type. Logistic regression did not identify PGY level as an independent predictor of complications or recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: There was a slight decrease in operative time when the repair was done with junior-level residents. PGY level did not influence outcomes for open, unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy when controlled for hernia type and technique. labels: #Adult#Aged#Clinical Competence#Female#Follow-Up Studies#General Surgery#Hernia, Inguinal#Herniorrhaphy#Humans#Internship and Residency#Logistic Models#Male#Middle Aged#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies#Texas#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Secondary lymphedema commonly arises as a complication of cancer surgery\xc2\xa0and radiation treatment; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) forms a complex with calcitonin receptor-like receptor to generate the receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide. The present study examined whether RAMP1 plays a role in increased lymphangiogenesis during secondary lymphedema.METHODS: A model of lymphedema was generated by surgical removal of pre-existing lymphatic vessels from the subcutaneous tissue on the tails of RAMP1-deficient (RAMP1-/-) mice and their wild-type (WT) counterparts. The maximum diameter of the tail, lymphangiogenesis, and macrophage recruitment were then examined.RESULTS: Compared with that in WT mice, lymphedema in the tails in RAMP1-/- mice was sustained, with suppressed lymphangiogenesis and reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 at the distal edge of the lesions. The newly formed lymphatic vessels in RAMP1-/- mice were dilated, with impaired lymphatic flow. RAMP1 was expressed by macrophages recruited into edematous tail tissues distal to the wound. The number of macrophages in RAMP1-/- mice was higher than that in WT mice. Expression of messenger RNA encoding M1 macrophage-related genes, including tumor necrosis factor-\xce\xb1 and interleukin-1, was higher in RAMP1-/- mice than in WT mice, whereas expression of messenger RNA encoding M2 macrophage genes, including interleukin-10, was lower.CONCLUSIONS: RAMP1 signaling improves lymphedema and accelerates lymphangiogenesis associated with reduced recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages. labels: #Animals#Biomarkers#Lymphangiogenesis#Lymphedema#Macrophages#Male#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mice, Knockout#Postoperative Complications#Receptor Activity-Modifying Protein 1#Signal Transduction'
b'BACKGROUND: Direct transport of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) to trauma centers (TCs) that can provide definitive care results in lower mortality rates. This study investigated the impact of direct versus nondirect transfers on the mortality rates of patients with sTBI.METHODS: Data on patients with TBI admitted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, to our Level I TC were obtained from the trauma registry. Data included patient age, sex, mechanism, and type of injury, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity scores, prehospital time, time to request and to transfer, time to initiation of multimodality monitoring and goal-directed therapy protocol, dwell time in the emergency department (EDT), and mortality. Data, reported in means\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa0standard deviation, were analyzed with the Student t-test and chi-square. Statistical significance was accepted at a P value\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05.RESULTS: sTBI direct transfer to TC versus transfer from non-TCs (NTC): Of the 1187 patients with TBI admitted to our TC, 768 (64.7%) were admitted directly from the scene, whereas 419 (35.3%) were admitted after secondary transfer. One hundred seventy-one (22.2%) of the direct transfers had Glasgow Coma Scale\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa08 (sTBI) and 92 (21.9%) of the secondary transfers had sTBI. The transfer time: Time from scene to arrival to the EDT was significantly shorter for TC versus NTCs 43\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa014 versus 77\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa026\xc2\xa0min, respectively (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). EDT dwell time before transfer and time from injury to arrival to TC were 4.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa02.1 and 6.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08.3\xc2\xa0h, respectively. Mortality: There was a statistically significant lower mortality for patients with sTBI transferred directly from the scene to TCs as opposed to patients secondarily transferred, 33/171 (19.3%) versus 33/92 (35.8%), respectively (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05).CONCLUSIONS: To decrease TBI-related mortality, patients with suspected sTBI should be taken directly to a Level I or II TC unless they require life-saving stabilization at NTCs. labels: #Adult#Aged#Brain Injuries, Traumatic#Female#Glasgow Coma Scale#Humans#Injury Severity Score#Male#Middle Aged#New York#Patient Transfer#Registries#Trauma Centers'
b'BACKGROUND: There is a high morbidity rate after digestive surgery in patients with nutritional disorders such as high body mass index and depletion of skeletal muscle.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ratio of psoas muscle area to trunk area was defined as the Psoas and All trunk Ratio (PandA Ratio) and used as an index of the balance between muscle and adipose tissue. This ratio was determined in 77 patients undergoing laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) for gastric cancer. Patients were classified into groups with and without postoperative complications. Clinicopathological factors were compared between the groups, and relationships of PandA Ratio with other nutritional indices were examined. PandA Ratios were also analyzed in males and females in each Clavien-Dindo grade.RESULTS: Complications developed in 22 patients (28.6%) after LAG. The PandA Ratio was significantly lower in patients with complications in univariate (2.76\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.22% versus 3.66\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.14%, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.0009) and multivariate (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.0064) analyses. A low PandA Ratio was also associated with more severe complications in males.CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of the areas of the psoas muscle and trunk on CT is useful for evaluation of the balance between skeletal and adipose tissue. The PandA Ratio derived from these measurements is a predictor of the clinical course after LAG in males. labels: #Adiposity#Adult#Aged#Body Composition#Female#Gastrectomy#Humans#Laparoscopy#Logistic Models#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Nutritional Status#Postoperative Complications#Psoas Muscles#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Thorax#Tomography, X-Ray Computed'
b'BACKGROUND: Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, possesses potent anti-inflammation effects. We previously confirmed the effects of naloxone on inhibiting upregulation of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\xce\xb2 (IL-1\xce\xb2). Production of mature form IL-1\xce\xb2 is mediated by the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a multiprotein complex composed of NLRP3, and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein contains a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). We elucidated whether naloxone could inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.MATERIAL AND METHODS: To induce IL-1\xce\xb2 production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1\xc2\xa0cells were first primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/mL) and then activated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1 mM). For NLRP3 transcription, THP-1\xc2\xa0cells were only treated with LPS priming.RESULTS: Enzyme-link immunosorbent assay data revealed that the concentration of IL-1\xce\xb2 in THP-1\xc2\xa0cells treated with LPS plus ATP was significantly higher than that in THP-1\xc2\xa0cells treated with LPS plus ATP plus naloxone (0.1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM) (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction data also revealed that NLRP3 mRNA concentration in THP-1\xc2\xa0cells treated with LPS was significantly higher than that in THP-1\xc2\xa0cells treated with LPS plus naloxone (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.001). ASC speck formation, that is, ASC assembles into a large protein complex, is an indicator for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our data revealed that the percentage of cells containing ASC specks in THP-1\xc2\xa0cells treated with LPS plus ATP was also significantly higher than that in THP-1\xc2\xa0cells treated with LPS plus ATP plus naloxone (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001).CONCLUSIONS: Naloxone inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation. labels: #Adenosine Triphosphate#Anti-Inflammatory Agents#Biomarkers#Cell Line#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Escherichia coli#Humans#Inflammasomes#Interleukin-1beta#Lipopolysaccharides#NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein#Naloxone#Peptide Fragments#Random Allocation#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction#Up-Regulation'
b'BACKGROUND: Prior interventions to address declining interest in surgical careers have focused on creating early exposure and fostering mentorship at the preclinical medical student level. Navigating the surgical environment can be challenging, however, and preclinical students may be more likely to pursue a surgical career if they are given the tools to function optimally.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a 10-wk technical and nontechnical skills curriculum to provide preclinical students with knowledge and skills necessary to successfully navigate the surgical learning environment, followed by placement in high-fidelity surgical simulations and scrubbing in on operative cases with attending surgeons. We administered pre-post surveys to assess student confidence levels in operative skills, self-perceptions of having a mentor, overall course efficacy, and interest in a career in surgery.RESULTS: The overall response rates presurvey and postsurvey were 100% (30 of 30) and 93.3% (28 of 30), respectively. Confidence levels across all operative skills increased significantly after completing the course. Faculty mentorship increased significantly from 30.0% before to 61.5% after the course. Overall effectiveness of the course was 4.00 of 5 (4\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0"very effective"), and although insignificant, overall interest in a career in surgery increased at the completion of the course from 3.77 (standard deviation\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.01) to 4.17 (standard deviation\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.94).CONCLUSIONS: Our curriculum was effective in teaching the skills necessary to enjoy positive experiences in planned early exposure and mentorship activities. Further study is warranted to determine if this intervention leads to an increase in students who formally commit to a career in surgery. labels: #California#Career Choice#Clinical Competence#Curriculum#Education, Medical, Undergraduate#Female#General Surgery#Humans#Male#Mentoring#Program Evaluation#Simulation Training'
b"BACKGROUND: Surgery is very cognitively demanding, particularly for novices. Novices are required to direct full attention on the procedure at hand, and additional demands can lead to cognitive overload. Through extensive practice, experts develop spare attentional capacity (SAC) for simultaneous tasks. However, little effort has been made to enhance novices' SAC. Mental skills may enhance attention management and increase SAC. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a novel mental skills curriculum (MSC) to enhance novices' attention management.METHODS: Sixty novice volunteers were randomly stratified to a control or MSC group based on baseline laparoscopic skill and mental skill use (assessed with the Test of Performance Strategies version 2 [TOPS-2]). All participants received laparoscopic training, whereas the MSC group received additional mental skills training. At all sessions, participants completed a secondary task during laparoscopy, which assessed SAC. Participants also completed the D2 Test of Attention and the TOPS-2 attention control subscale, which are valid attention measures.RESULTS: Fifty-five novices completed the study. Both groups displayed significantly improved laparoscopic suturing ability (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) and D2 performance (control: P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.005, MSC: P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01), but there were no between-group differences in D2 or TOPS attention control scores. However, only the MSC group displayed significantly improved hit rate on the secondary task (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05).CONCLUSIONS: The novel MSC implemented in this study enhanced surgical novices' SAC compared to controls, and it is clear that this curriculum may be effective at enhancing learners' ability to attend multiple task-relevant stimuli concurrently. Additional study of the impact of this MSC on learners' attentional capacity is currently underway. labels: #Adult#Attention#Clinical Competence#Curriculum#Female#Humans#Laparoscopy#Male#Simulation Training#Surgeons#United States"

b"BACKGROUND: Nissen fundoplication is considered an advanced minimally invasive procedure whether performed laparoscopically or robotically. In laparoscopic surgery, it is evident that assistant skill level impacts operative times. However, the robotic platform allows improved surgeon autonomy. We aimed to determine the impact of assistant training level on operative times in robotic Nissen fundoplication (RNF) and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF).METHODS: A prospectively maintained Nissen database (2011-2016) from a single academic institution was utilized to collect patient characteristics, operative times, length of stay, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, readmission rate, and assistant training level. Assistants were either postgraduate year-3 surgery residents defined as junior-level assistants or a minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fellow defined as senior-level assistants.RESULTS: There were 105 patients included in our analyses. When comparing postgraduate year-3 residents to MIS fellows performing LNF, the median operative time was significantly decreased when senior-level assistants were present in the LNF group, 85 (75-103) versus 129 (74-269) min, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.02. In comparison, median operative times in the RNF group were independent of the assistant's level of training, 154 (71-300) versus 158 (101-215) min, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.34. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the junior- and senior-level assistant cohorts for estimated blood loss, length of stay, postoperative complications, and 30-d readmission rates in either the LNF or RNF group.CONCLUSIONS: Assistant training level impacted operative time for LNF but not RNF. These differences are most likely attributed to increased autonomy of the operating surgeon afforded by the robotic platform reducing assistant variability. labels: #Adult#Aged#Clinical Competence#Education, Medical, Graduate#Fellowships and Scholarships#Female#Fundoplication#Humans#Internship and Residency#Laparoscopy#Male#Middle Aged#New York City#Operative Time#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Retrospective Studies#Robotic Surgical Procedures"
b"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of miscarriage in women with endometriosis (WwE) compared with disease-free control women (CW).DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis nested in a retrospective observational study (n = 940).SETTING: Hospitals and associated private practices.PATIENT(S): Previously pregnant women (n = 268) within reproductive age in matched pairs.INTERVENTION(S): Retrospective analysis of surgical reports and self-administered questionnaires.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rate of miscarriage, subanalysis for fertility status (\xe2\x89\xa412 vs.>12\xc2\xa0months' time to conception), endometriosis stages (revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine classification [rASRM] I/II vs. III/IV) and phenotypic localizations (superficial peritoneal, ovarian, and deep infiltrating endometriosis).RESULT(S): The miscarriage rate was higher in WwE (35.8% [95% confidence interval 29.6%-42.0%]) compared with CW (22.0% [16.7%-27.0%]); adjusted incidence risk ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.41-2.75). This remained significant in subfertile WwE (50.0% [40.7%-59.4%]) vs. CW (25.8% [8.5%-41.2%]) but not in fertile WwE (24.5% [16.3%-31.6%]) vs. CW (21.5% [15.9%-26.8%]). The miscarriage rate was higher in women with milder forms (rASRM I/II 42.1% [32.6%-51.4%] vs. rASRM III/IV 30.8% [22.6%-38.7%], compared with 22.0% [16.7%-27.0%] in CW), and in women with superficial peritoneal endometriosis (42.0% [32.0%-53.9%]) compared with ovarian endometriosis (28.6% [17.7%-38.7%]) and deep infiltrating endometriosis (33.9% [21.2%-46.0%]) compared with CW (22.0% [16.7%-27.0%]).CONCLUSION(S): Mild endometriosis, as in superficial lesions, is related to a great extent of inflammatory disorder, possibly leading to defective folliculogenesis, fertilization, and/or implantation, presenting as increased risk of miscarriage.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02511626. labels: #Abortion, Spontaneous#Adolescent#Adult#Cross-Sectional Studies#Endometriosis#Europe#Female#Fertility#Humans#Infertility, Female#Middle Aged#Odds Ratio#Pregnancy#Prevalence#Retrospective Studies#Risk Assessment#Risk Factors#Severity of Illness Index#Young Adult"
b'OBJECTIVE: To compare total antim\xc3\xbcllerian hormone (AMH), proAMH, AMHN,C, and the ratio of the two forms in predictive models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis. Total AMH consists of proAMH (inactive precursor) and AMHN,C(receptor-competent), but neither isoform has been tested individually for their ability to predict PCOS diagnosis.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using biobanked samples collected between July 2008 and January\xc2\xa02010.SETTING: Not applicable.PATIENT(S): Overweight, premenopausal women aged 18-45\xc2\xa0years with PCOS (n = 45, with 21 fulfilling National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria and 24 fulfilling European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE) criteria, but not National Institutes of Health criteria) and without PCOS (n = 23 controls).INTERVENTION(S): None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Serum concentrations of proAMH and total AMH (proAMH and AMHN,Ccombined) were determined by immunoassay. The AMHN,Cconcentrations were calculated by subtraction ([AMHN,C] = [total AMH]- [proAMH]). Relative levels of proAMH were expressed as the AMH prohormone index (API = [ProAMH]/[Total AMH] \xc3\x97 100).RESULT(S): In women with PCOS, total AMH, proAMH, and AMHN,Clevels were higher, and the API was lower (P=.010), than in controls indicating increased conversion of proAMH to AMHN,C. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis for proAMH (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82), AMHN,C(AUC = 0.86), and API (AUC = 0.70) did not improve the prediction for PCOS when compared with total AMH (AUC = 0.86).CONCLUSION(S): The proAMH and AMHN,Cdo not appear to improve the ability to predict a diagnosis of PCOS beyond total AMH assays. However, the ratio of inactive proAMH precursor to receptor-competent AMHN,C(API) differs in women with PCOS relative to unaffected controls indicating that AMH signaling mechanisms may be altered in women with PCOS. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Anti-Mullerian Hormone#Area Under Curve#Biomarkers#Case-Control Studies#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Middle Aged#Polycystic Ovary Syndrome#Predictive Value of Tests#Prognosis#Protein Isoforms#Protein Precursors#ROC Curve#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to acutely visualize radiofrequency ablation lesions, but its accuracy in predicting chronic lesion size is unknown. The main goal of this study was to characterize different areas of enhancement in late gadolinium enhancement MRI done immediately after ablation to predict acute edema and chronic lesion size.METHODS AND RESULTS: In a canine model (n=10), ventricular radiofrequency lesions were created using ThermoCool SmartTouch (Biosense Webster) catheter. All animals underwent MRI (late gadolinium enhancement and T2-weighted edema imaging) immediately after ablation and after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Edema, microvascular obstruction, and enhanced volumes were identified in MRI and normalized to chronic histological volume. Immediately after contrast administration, the microvascular obstruction region was 3.2\xc2\xb11.1 times larger than the chronic lesion volume in acute MRI. Even 60 minutes after contrast administration, edema was 8.7\xc2\xb13.31 times and the enhanced area 6.14\xc2\xb12.74 times the chronic lesion volume. Exponential fit to the microvascular obstruction volume was found to be the best predictor of chronic lesion volume at 26.14 minutes (95% prediction interval, 24.35-28.11 minutes) after contrast injection. The edema volume in late gadolinium enhancement correlated well with edema volume in T2-weighted MRI with anR2of 0.99.CONCLUSION: Microvascular obstruction region on acute late gadolinium enhancement images acquired 26.1 minutes after contrast administration can accurately predict the chronic lesion volume. We also show that T1-weighted MRI images acquired immediately after contrast injection accurately shows edema resulting from radiofrequency ablation. labels: #Animals#Biopsy#Catheter Ablation#Cicatrix#Contrast Media#Coronary Circulation#Dogs#Edema, Cardiac#Heart Ventricles#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Meglumine#Microcirculation#Models, Animal#Organometallic Compounds#Predictive Value of Tests#Time Factors'
b'Pigmentary hypertrichosis and non-autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (PHID) is associated with recessive mutations inSLC29A3, encoding the equilibrative nucleoside transporter hENT3 expressed in mitochondria, causing PHID and H syndromes, familial Rosai-Dorfman disease, and histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy-plus syndrome. Autoinflammation is increasingly recognized in these syndromes. We previously reported a 16-year-old girl with PHID syndrome associated with severe autoinflammation that was recalcitrant to interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\xce\xb1 blockade. Tocilizumab is a humanized, monoclonal, anti-human interleukin-6 receptor antibody routinely used to treat arthritis in children and adults. Herein we report the first case of successful treatment of PHID syndrome using tocilizumab. Before commencing tocilizumab, there was evidence of significant systemic inflammation, and progressive sclerodermatous changes (physician global assessment [PGA] 7/10). Twelve weeks after starting tocilizumab (8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, intravenously) systemic inflammatory symptoms improved, and acute phase response markers normalized; serum amyloid A reduced from 178 to 8.4 mg/L. After a dose increase to 12 mg/kg every 2 weeks her energy levels, appetite, fevers, and night sweats further improved. Less skin tightness (PGA 5/10) was documented 12 months later. This excellent clinical and serological response was sustained over 48 months, and cutaneous sclerosis had improved further (PGA 3/10). Her height remained well below the 0.4th centile, and tocilizumab also had no impact on her diabetes or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Although the mechanism of autoinflammation of PHID remains uncertain, we suggest that tocilizumab should be the first choice when considering treatment of the autoinflammatory or cutaneous manifestations of this genetic disease. labels: #Adolescent#Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized#Contracture#Female#Hearing Loss, Sensorineural#Histiocytosis#Humans#Mutation#Nucleoside Transport Proteins#Syndrome#Treatment Outcome'
b'Purpose: To test the hypothesis that retinal vascular diameter and hemoglobin oxygen saturation alterations, according to stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR), are discernible with a commercially available scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO).Methods: One hundred eighty-one subjects with no diabetes (No DM), diabetes with no DR (No DR), nonproliferative DR (NPDR), or proliferative DR (PDR, all had photocoagulation) underwent imaging with an SLO with dual lasers (532 nm and 633 nm). Customized image analysis software determined the diameters of retinal arteries and veins (DA and DV) and central retinal artery and vein equivalents (CRAE and CRVE). Oxygen saturations of hemoglobin in arteries and veins (SO2A and SO2V) were estimated from optical densities of vessels on images at the two wavelengths. Statistical models were generated by adjusting for effects of sex, race, age, eye, and fundus pigmentation.Results: DA, CRAE, and CRVE were reduced in PDR compared to No DM (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.03). DV and CRVE were similar between No DM and No DR, but they were higher in NPDR than No DR (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.01). Effect of stage of disease on SO2A differed by race, being increased relative to No DM in NPDR and PDR in Hispanic participants only (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.02). Relative to No DM, SO2V was increased in NPDR and PDR (P \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05).Conclusions: Alterations in retinal vascular diameters and SO2 by diabetic retinopathy stage can be detected with a widely available SLO, and covariates such as race can influence the results. labels: #Adult#Aged#Diabetic Retinopathy#Equipment Design#Female#Hemoglobins#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Ophthalmoscopes#Oximetry#Oxygen#Oxygen Consumption#Retinal Vessels'
b'Purpose: Dry eye syndrome (DES) can cause blindness in severe cases, but mainly palliative treatments exist. A tissue-engineered lacrimal gland (LG) could provide a curative treatment. We aimed to evaluate decellularized porcine jejunum (SIS-Muc) as a scaffold for porcine LG epithelial cells.Methods: To evaluate SIS-Muc as a potential scaffold, basement membrane proteins in SIS-Muc and native LG were compared (immunohistochemistry [IHC]). Porcine LG epithelial cells cultured on plastic were characterized (immunocytochemistry), and their culture supernatant was compared with porcine tears (proteomics). Epithelial cells were then seeded onto SIS-Muc in either a static (cell crown) or dynamic culture (within a perfusion chamber) and metabolic (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and secretory capacities (\xce\xb2-hexosaminidase assay), protein expression (IHC), and ultrastructure transmission electron microscopy (TEM) compared in each.Results: Collagen IV and laminin were found in both native LG and SIS-Muc. When cultured on plastic, LG epithelial cells expressed pan-cytokeratin, Rab3D, HexA, and produced mucins, but lysozyme and lactoferrin expression was nearly absent. Some porcine tear proteins (lipocalin-2 and lactoferrin) were found in LG epithelial cell culture supernatants. When LG cells were cultured on SIS-Muc, metabolic and \xce\xb2-hexosaminidase activities were greater in dynamic cultures than static cultures (P<0.05). In both static and dynamic cultures, cells expressed pan-cytokeratin, Rab3D, lysozyme, and lactoferrin and produced mucins, and TEM revealed cell polarization at the apical surface and cell-cell and cell-scaffold contacts.Conclusions: SIS-Muc is a suitable scaffold for LG cell expansion and may be useful toward reconstruction of LG tissue to provide a curative treatment for DES. Dynamic culture enhances cell metabolic and functional activities. labels: #Animals#Cell Proliferation#Cells, Cultured#Disease Models, Animal#Dry Eye Syndromes#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Immunohistochemistry#Jejunum#Lacrimal Apparatus#Microscopy, Electron, Transmission#Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Swine#Tissue Engineering'

b'We propose and analyze a compartmental nonlinear deterministic mathematical model for the typhoid fever outbreak and optimal control strategies in a community with varying population. The model is studied qualitatively using stability theory of differential equations and the basic reproductive number that represents the epidemic indicator is obtained from the largest eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix. Both local and global asymptotic stability conditions for disease-free and endemic equilibria are determined. The model exhibits a forward transcritical bifurcation and the sensitivity analysis is performed. The optimal control problem is designed by applying Pontryagin maximum principle with three control strategies, namely, the prevention strategy through sanitation, proper hygiene, and vaccination; the treatment strategy through application of appropriate medicine; and the screening of the carriers. The cost functional accounts for the cost involved in prevention, screening, and treatment together with the total number of the infected persons averted. Numerical results for the typhoid outbreak dynamics and its optimal control revealed that a combination of prevention and treatment is the best cost-effective strategy to eradicate the disease. labels: #Computational Biology#Computer Simulation#Cost-Benefit Analysis#Disease Outbreaks#Humans#Mass Screening#Mathematical Concepts#Models, Biological#Nonlinear Dynamics#Typhoid Fever'

b'Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a syndrome with predominantly defective B cell function. However, abnormalities in the number and function of other lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood (PB) have been described in most patients. We have analysed the distribution of iNKT cell subpopulations in the PB of CVID patients and the ability of these cells to provide in\xc2\xa0vitro cognate B cell help. The total of iNKT cells was reduced in the PB of CVID patients, especially CD4+, CD4-/CD8- and CCR5+/CXCR3+. These findings were associated with an enrichment of memory-like and a tendency towards a reduction in TNF-\xce\xb1-expressing effector iNKT cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CVID patients. Moreover, an accumulation of follicular helper iNKT cells in the PB of CVID patients was demonstrated. CVID \xce\xb1GalCer-pulsed iNKT cells are not able to induce autologous B cell proliferation although they do induce proliferation to healthy donor B cells. Interestingly, autologous and heterologous co-cultures did not differ in the amount of immunoglobulin secreted by B cells in\xc2\xa0vitro. Finally, reduced intracellular SAP expression in iNKT cells and other lymphocytes in the blood from CVID patients was observed. These results provide further insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the iNKT cell defects and the potential targets to improve B cell help in CVID. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#B-Lymphocytes#CD4 Antigens#CD8 Antigens#Cell Communication#Cell Proliferation#Cells, Cultured#Coculture Techniques#Common Variable Immunodeficiency#Female#Galactosylceramides#Humans#Immunoglobulins#Immunologic Memory#Lymphocyte Activation#Male#Middle Aged#Natural Killer T-Cells#Receptors, CCR5#Receptors, CXCR3#Saposins#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that alternates its life cycle between the sand-fly vector and the mammalian host. This alternation involves environmental changes and leads the parasite to dynamic modifications in morphology, metabolism, cellular signaling and regulation of gene expression to allow for a rapid adaptation to new conditions. The L-arginine pathway in L. amazonensis is important during the parasite life cycle and interferes in the establishment and maintenance of the infection in mammalian macrophages. Host arginase is an immune-regulatory enzyme that can reduce the production of nitric oxide by activated macrophages, directing the availability of L-arginine to the polyamine pathway, resulting in parasite replication. In this work, we performed transcriptional profiling to identify differentially expressed genes in L. amazonensis wild-type (La-WT) versus L. amazonensis arginase knockout (La-arg-) promastigotes and axenic amastigotes.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 8253 transcripts were identified in La-WT and La-arg- promastigotes and axenic amastigotes, about 60% of them codifying hypothetical proteins and 443 novel transcripts, which did not match any previously annotated genes. Our RNA-seq data revealed that 85% of genes were constitutively expressed. The comparison of transcriptome and metabolome data showed lower levels of arginase and higher levels of glutamate-5-kinase in La-WT axenic amastigotes compared to promastigotes. The absence of arginase activity in promastigotes increased the levels of pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase, but decreased the levels of arginosuccinate synthase, pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, acetylornithine deacetylase and spermidine synthase transcripts levels. These observations can explain previous metabolomic data pointing to the increase of L-arginine, citrulline and L-glutamate and reduction of aspartate, proline, ornithine and putrescine. Altogether, these results indicate that arginase activity is important in Leishmania gene expression modulation during differentiation and adaptation to environmental changes. Here, we confirmed this hypothesis with the identification of differential gene expression of the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of amino acids, arginine and proline metabolism and arginine biosynthesis.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: All data provided information about the transcriptomic profiling and the expression levels of La-WT and La-arg- promastigotes and axenic amastigotes. These findings revealed the importance of arginase in parasite survival and differentiation, and indicated the existence of a coordinated response in the absence of arginase activity related to arginine and polyamine pathways. labels: #Arginase#Arginine#Gene Expression#Gene Expression Profiling#Gene Expression Regulation#Gene Knockout Techniques#Leishmania mexicana#Macrophages#Nitric Oxide#Polyamines#Sequence Analysis, RNA'
b'The interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) encodes one of the most abundant proteins induced by interferon, and its expression is associated with antiviral immunity. To identify protein components implicated in IFN and ISG15 signaling, we compared the proteomes of ISG15-/- and ISG15+/+ bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) after vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. The results of this analysis revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were pathways altered in ISG15-/- BMDM treated with IFN. Mitochondrial respiration, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was higher in ISG15+/+ BMDM than in ISG15-/- BMDM following IFN treatment, indicating the involvement of ISG15-dependent mechanisms. An additional consequence of ISG15 depletion was a significant change in macrophage polarization. Although infected ISG15-/- macrophages showed a robust proinflammatory cytokine expression pattern typical of an M1 phenotype, a clear blockade of nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation was detected. Accordingly, following IFN treatment, NO release was higher in ISG15+/+ macrophages than in ISG15-/- macrophages concomitant with a decrease in viral titer. Thus, ISG15-/- macrophages were permissive for VACV replication following IFN treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically, OXPHOS and mitophagy, broadening its physiological role as an antiviral agent. labels: #Animals#Arginase#Cytokines#Enzyme Activation#Macrophages#Mice#Mice, Knockout#Mitochondria#Mitochondrial Degradation#Nitric Oxide#Oxidative Phosphorylation#Ubiquitins#Vaccinia#Vaccinia virus'
b'Background: For health care providers in the United States, the risk for nonfatal violence in the workplace is 16 times greater than that for other workers. Inappropriate patient sexual behavior (IPSB) is directed at clinicians, staff, or other patients and may include leering, sexual remarks, deliberate touching, indecent exposure, and sexual assault. Inappropriate patient sexual behavior may adversely affect clinicians, the organization, or patients themselves. Few IPSB risk factors for physical therapists have been confirmed. The US prevalence was last assessed in the 1990s.Objective: The objectives of this study were to determine career and 12-month exposure to IPSB among US physical therapists, physical therapist assistants, physical therapist students, and physical therapist assistant students and to identify IPSB risk factors.Design: This was a retrospective and observational study.Methods: An electronic survey was developed; content validity and test-retest reliability were established. Participants were recruited through physical therapist and physical therapist assistant academic programs and sections of the American Physical Therapy Association. Inappropriate patient sexual behavior risk models were constructed individually for any, mild, moderate, and severe IPSB events reported over the past 12 months. Open-ended comments were analyzed using qualitative methods.Results: Eight hundred ninety-two physical therapist professionals and students completed the survey. The career prevalence among respondents was 84%, and the 12-month prevalence was 47%. Statistical risk modeling for any IPSB over the past 12 months indicated the following risks: having fewer years of direct patient care, routinely working with patients with cognitive impairments, being a female practitioner, and treating male patients. Qualitative analysis of 187 open-ended comments revealed patient-related characteristics, provider-related characteristics, and abusive actions.Limitations: Self-report, clinician memory, and convenience sampling are limitations of this type of survey research.Conclusions: The extremely high prevalence of IPSB among physical therapist professionals warrants practitioner and student education as well as clear workplace policy and support. labels: #Adult#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Physical Therapy Specialty#Physician-Patient Relations#Prevalence#Retrospective Studies#Risk#Risk Factors#Sex Offenses#Sexual Behavior#United States'
b'Background: There is significant need for trials evaluating the long-term effectiveness of a rigorous program of perioperative behavioral therapy with pelvic floor muscle training (BPMT) in women undergoing transvaginal reconstructive surgery for prolapse.Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative BPMT on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and sexual function following vaginal surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI).Design: This study is a secondary report of a 2 \xc3\x97 2 factorial randomized controlled trial.Setting: This study was a multicenter trial.Participants: Participants were adult women with stage 2-4 POP and SUI.Intervention: Perioperative BPMT versus usual care and sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) versus uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) were provided.Measurements: Participants undergoing transvaginal surgery (SSLF or ULS for POP and a midurethral sling for SUI) received usual care or five perioperative BPMT visits. The primary outcome was change in body image and in Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) short-form subscale, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire short form (PISQ-12), Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGII), and Brink scores.Results: The 374 participants were randomized to BPMT (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0186) and usual care (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0188). Outcomes were available for 137 (74%) of BPMT participants and 146 (78%) of the usual care participants at 24 months. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in PFIQ, SF-36, PGII, PISQ-12, or body image scale measures.Limitations: The clinicians providing BPMT had variable expertise. Findings might not apply to vaginal prolapse procedures without slings or abdominal apical prolapse procedures.Conclusions: Perioperative BPMT performed as an adjunct to vaginal surgery for POP and SUI provided no additional improvement in QOL or sexual function compared with usual care. labels: #Behavior Therapy#Body Image#Female#Humans#Middle Aged#Pelvic Organ Prolapse#Perioperative Care#Quality of Life#Resistance Training#Sexual Behavior#Suburethral Slings#Surveys and Questionnaires#Treatment Outcome'
b'Background: The Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) is a generic metric of patient-reported functional status. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the AM-PAC score has not been determined.Objective: The study objective was to determine the MCID for AM-PAC in people with low back pain.Design: This was a retrospective cohort study.Methods: Anchor-based and distribution-based methods were used to estimate the MCID. The Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire was used as the anchor. Adults who had a primary ICD-9 code for low back pain in at least 1 outpatient physical therapist visit during an episode of care and who completed both the AM-PAC and the Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire in at least 2 visits during the care episode were included. The MCID was calculated for the AM-PAC basic mobility version as well its adapted version, which the Cleveland Clinic uses for patients 65 years old or older.Results: A total of 1,271 participants were eligible for study. For the AM-PAC basic mobility version, anchor-based methods yielded MCID estimates of between 3.4 and 5.1, whereas distribution-based methods yielded estimates of 1.7 to 4.2. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for the AM-PAC basic mobility version was 3.3. For the adapted AM-PAC basic mobility version, the MCID was estimated to be between 2.9 and 4.0 via anchor-based methods and between 1.2 to 3.5 via distribution-based methods. The MDC for the adapted AM-PAC basic mobility version was 3.5.Limitations: The estimated MCID was designed for people with low back pain only.Conclusions: The MCID ranged from 3.3 to 5.1 for the AM-PAC basic mobility version and 3.5 to 4 for the adapted version, with the MDC as the lower limit. Changes in the AM-PAC for people with low back pain may be interpreted using the estimated MCID. Future studies are needed to determine the AM-PAC MCID for populations other than those with low back pain. labels: #Adult#Disability Evaluation#Exercise#Female#Humans#Low Back Pain#Male#Middle Aged#Minimal Clinically Important Difference#Pain Measurement#Patient Reported Outcome Measures#Retrospective Studies#Subacute Care#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b"Background: Evidence-based guidelines are needed to inform rehabilitation practice, including the effect of number of exercise training sessions on recovery of walking ability after stroke.Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the response to increasing number of training sessions of 2 interventions-locomotor training and strength and balance exercises-on poststroke walking recovery.Design: This is a secondary analysis of the Locomotor Experience Applied Post-Stroke (LEAPS) randomized controlled trial.Setting: Six rehabilitation sites in California and Florida and participants' homes were used.Participants: Participants were adults who dwelled in the community (N=347), had had a stroke, were able to walk at least 3 m (10 ft) with assistance, and had completed the required number of intervention sessions.Intervention: Participants received 36 sessions (3 times per week for 12 weeks), 90 minutes in duration, of locomotor training (gait training on a treadmill with body-weight support and overground training) or strength and balance training.Measurements: Talking speed, as measured by the 10-Meter Walk Test, and 6-minute walking distance were assessed before training and following 12, 24, and 36 intervention sessions.Results: Participants at 2 and 6 months after stroke gained in gait speed and walking endurance after up to 36 sessions of treatment, but the rate of gain diminished steadily and, on average, was very low during the 25- to 36-session epoch, regardless of treatment type or severity of impairment.Limitations: Results may not generalize to people who are unable to initiate a step at 2 months after stroke or people with severe cardiac disease.Conclusions: In general, people who dwelled in the community showed improvements in gait speed and walking distance with up to 36 sessions of locomotor training or strength and balance exercises at both 2 and 6 months after stroke. However, gains beyond 24 sessions tended to be very modest. The tracking of individual response trajectories is imperative in planning treatment. labels: #Aged#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Postural Balance#Recovery of Function#Resistance Training#Single-Blind Method#Stroke#Stroke Rehabilitation#Treatment Outcome#Walking#Walking Speed"
b'Background: The Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) is a condition-specific measure for women with pelvic girdle pain (PGP). The PGQ includes items relating to activity/participation and bodily symptoms and has reliability, validity, and feasibility for use in research and clinical practice.Objective: The purposes of this study were to examine the responsiveness of the PGQ, to determine the minimal important change (MIC) for the PGQ, and to compare the PGQ with other outcome measures.Design: This study used a prospective cohort design.Methods: A total of 801 women responded to a booklet of questionnaires in the last trimester of their pregnancy and within 3 months post partum. Responsiveness analyses followed recommendations from the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. The responsiveness of the PGQ was tested by examining correlations between the change scores of the total PGQ and the other patient-reported outcome measures.Results: A total of 606 women (76%) reported PGP, low back pain, or both. Of these women, 441 (73%) responded to the follow-up questionnaire post partum. The PGQ (both subscale and total scores) discriminated most accurately between participants who improved and those who did not improve, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 72%. The MIC values indicated that a change score smaller than 25 for the total score and activity subscale score and a change score of 20 for the symptom subscale score should be regarded as insignificant. Baseline PGQ scores had a large impact on the MIC estimates for the absolute change scores but not on the relative percentage change scores. Five of 6 hypotheses were supported (83%).Limitations: The type of anchor and definition of important change used might be weaknesses in women whose status is changing from pregnant to post partum.Conclusions: The PGQ showed acceptable responsiveness in women with PGP, low back pain, or both. labels: #Adult#Female#Humans#Low Back Pain#Minimal Clinically Important Difference#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Pelvic Girdle Pain#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Complications#Prospective Studies#Reproducibility of Results#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b'So called "personalized therapy" has revolutionized the care of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The discovery of more and more driver mutations in NSCLC has led to a molecular defined sub classification of lung cancer patients. For four driver mutations (EGFRmut, ALKtransl, ROS1transl, BRAF-V600mut) firstline approved drugs are available and became the treatment of choice. Further drugs are in clinical development or can be used as off-label treatment. The emergence of resistance under targeted therapy, the development of new drugs for further driver mutations and the broad implementation of molecular diagnostics for all lung cancer patients are future challenges. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Molecular Targeted Therapy#Mutation#Precision Medicine'
b'Within the last years, significant improvements have been achieved in breast cancer treatment, particularly with the development of targeted therapies. Major progress has been made in identifying the drivers malignant growth in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer and the mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. This progress has translated into several targeted therapies that enhance the efficacy of endocrine therapy; inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 like palbociclib and inhibitors of mTOR substantially improve progression-free survival. For patients with HER2-positive disease the addition of Pertuzumab to Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been a significant improvement in anti-HER2 therapy in early as well as metastatic breast cancer. Evidence-based further line therapy options in the metastatic setting include T-DM1 and in later lines Lapatinib. For triple negative disease the angiogenesis inhibitor Bevacizumab is approved, which increases progression free survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, PARP-inhibitors or anti-androgens represent promising strategies, all of which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The development of predictive biomarkers to guide targeted therapies is still the subject of research. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Breast Neoplasms#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Humans#Molecular Targeted Therapy'
b'Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a major cause for cancer related death in Western countries. Particularly in the metastatic stage (mCRC) 5-year survival rate remains low at around 15\xe2\x80\x8a%. Treatment decisions are influenced by tumor stage, location of the primary, and extend of metastases. The multidisciplinary tumor board with an experienced hepato-biliary surgeon, an interventional radiologist, the medical oncologist, the molecular pathologist and the radiation oncologist will gain further importance in the quest for the optimal treatment for each patient. In the adjuvant setting, next to the established clinical risk factors, individualization especially for UICC-stage II patients can be done according to the CDX2-expression, the MSI-status, and perhaps the PIK3-status. In the metastatic stage, RAS and BRAF mutational analyses are pivotal to choose the best treatment for our patients. Primary tumor location in RAS-wild-type patients is further helping the clinician to tailor first-line treatment. Ongoing phase-III-trials will further help the clinician to come to a personalized decision. labels: #Biomarkers, Tumor#Colorectal Neoplasms#DNA Mutational Analysis#Humans#Precision Medicine#Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf#Survival Analysis'

b'INTRODUCTION: Soft tissue occlusion of the external auditory canal (EAC) can cause intense pruritis, recurrent foul smelling otorrhea, recurrent otitis externa, and conductive hearing loss. Occlusion of the EAC can be challenging to treat as the area is prone to circumferential scarring.METHODS: We describe the novel use of serial bipolar radiofrequency ablation (coblation) to treat 3 children with complete EAC occlusion from congenital and acquired conditions including lymphedema (1), microcystic lymphatic malformation (1), and venolymphatic malformation (1).RESULTS: Patients underwent a mean of 3 procedures with postoperative EAC stenting (7 days) and antibiotic and steroid aural preparations (10 days). Otologic symptoms resolved in all patients, and their EACs remained patent 14 months after last procedure (range, 4-32 months). One patient experienced a pinpoint tympanic membrane perforation that healed spontaneously 2 weeks later.CONCLUSIONS: Coblation of soft tissue stenosis of the EAC can be an effective treatment for this problematic condition. labels: #Catheter Ablation#Child#Child, Preschool#Ear Canal#Ear Diseases#Female#Humans#Infant#Lymphatic Abnormalities#Male'
b'OBJECTIVES: Occupational voice users report higher instances of vocal health problems. Women, who are more likely than men to report voice problems, are the largest members of some occupational voice users, such as teachers. While a common complaint among this population is vocal fatigue, it has been difficult to quantify. Therefore, the goal of this study is to quantify vocal fatigue generally in school teachers and investigate any related gender differences.METHODS: Six hundred forty (518 female, 122 male) teachers were surveyed using an online questionnaire consisting in part of the Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI), an index specifically designed to quantify vocal fatigue.RESULTS: Compared to vocally healthy adults, the teachers surveyed were 3 times as likely to report vocal tiredness or vocal avoidance and over 3 times as likely to report physical voice discomfort. Additionally, female teachers were more likely to have scores approaching those with dysphonia.CONCLUSIONS: The VFI quantified elevated levels of vocal fatigue in teachers, with a significant prevalence of symptoms reported among females compared to males. Further, because the VFI indicated elevated complaints (between normal and dysphonic) in a population likely to be elevated, the VFI might be used to identify early indications of voice problems and/or track recovery. labels: #Adult#Educational Personnel#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Occupational Diseases#Prevalence#Sex Factors#Surveys and Questionnaires#Voice Disorders#Voice Quality'
b'OBJECTIVES: Tissue engineering of auricular cartilage has great potential in providing readily available materials for reconstructive surgeries. As the field of tissue engineering moves forward to developing human tissues, there needs to be an interspecies comparison of the native auricular cartilage in order to determine a suitable animal model to assess the performance of engineered auricular cartilage in vivo.METHODS: Here, we performed interspecies comparisons of auricular cartilage by comparing tissue microstructure, protein localization, biochemical composition, and mechanical properties of auricular cartilage tissues from rat, rabbit, pig, cow, and human.RESULTS: Human, pig, and cow auricular cartilage have smaller lacunae compared to rat and rabbit cartilage ( P<.05). Despite differences in tissue microstructure, human auricular cartilage has similar biochemical composition to both rat and rabbit. Auricular cartilage from pig and cow, alternatively, display significantly higher glycosaminoglycan and collagen contents compared to human, rat, and rabbit ( P<.05). The mechanical properties of human auricular cartilage were comparable to that of all 4 animal species.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that compares the microstructural, biochemical, and mechanical properties of auricular cartilage from different species. This study showed that different experimental animal models of human auricular cartilage may be suitable in different cases. labels: #Animals#Cattle#Ear Cartilage#Humans#Models, Animal#Rabbits#Rats#Swine#Tissue Engineering'
b'OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of in-office potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) treatment of vocal fold granulomas and identify any predictors of complete lesion resolution.METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent in-office KTP ablation of vocal fold granulomas between 2007 and 2016 was performed. Medical records were reviewed for use of acid suppression medication, prior surgical treatment, voice therapy, laser settings, number of treatments, follow-up time, and Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) scores.RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent a total of 43 laser treatments. Eighty percent of patients were previously on acid suppression medication, and 42.3% had failed previous endoscopic treatments. Patients underwent a mean number of 1.65 \xc2\xb1 1.16 in-office treatments with decrease in size in 96.2% of cases. The VHI-10 was not significantly affected. Complete resolution occurred in 73.1% of cases with follow-up time ranging from 1 to 86 months (median = 9.5 months). No recurrences occurred in patients with complete resolution. Other than undergoing a single KTP treatment, no variable was found to be predictive of complete lesion resolution. Granuloma etiology was not predictive of lesion resolution but did correlate with symptom improvement.CONCLUSION: In-office pulsed KTP laser is an effective treatment option for vocal fold granulomas as the lesion resolves in the majority of cases. labels: #Aged#Ambulatory Surgical Procedures#Female#Granuloma, Laryngeal#Humans#Laser Therapy#Lasers, Solid-State#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Vocal Cords#Voice Quality'
b'BACKGROUND: Stimuli-responsive polymer materials are a new kind of intelligent materials based on the concept of bionics, which exhibits more significant changes in physicochemical properties upon triggered by tiny environment stimuli, hence providing a good carrier platform for antitumor drug delivery.RESULTS: Dual stimuli-responsive Fe3O4graft poly(acrylic acid)-block-poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl ferrocenecarboxylate) block copolymers (Fe3O4-g-PAA-b-PMAEFC) were engineered and synthesized through a two-step sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization route. The characterization was performed by FTIR,1H NMR, SEC, XRD and TGA techniques. The self-assembly behavior in aqueous solution upon triggered by pH, magnetic and redox stimuli was investigated via zeta potentials, vibration sample magnetometer, cyclic voltammetry, fluorescent spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, XPS, TEM and SEM measurements. The experimental results indicated that the Fe3O4-g-PAA-b-PMAEFC copolymer materials could spontaneously assemble into hybrid magnetic copolymer micromicelles with core-shell structure, and exhibited superparamagnetism, redox and pH stimuli-responsive features. The hybrid copolymer micromicelles were stable and nontoxic, and could entrap hydrophobic anticancer drug, which was in turn swiftly and effectively delivered from the drug-loaded micromicelles at special microenvironments such as acidic pH and high reactive oxygen species.CONCLUSION: This class of stimuli-responsive copolymer materials is expected to find wide applications in medical science and biology, etc., especially in drug delivery system. labels: #Acrylic Resins#Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic#Cell Line, Tumor#Delayed-Action Preparations#Drug Delivery Systems#Drug Liberation#Ferrosoferric Oxide#Ferrous Compounds#Humans#Hydrogen-Ion Concentration#Magnetic Fields#Micelles#Neoplasms#Oxidation-Reduction#Paclitaxel#Polymers'
b'BACKGROUND: Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (CSWS) was initially described over 60 years ago in hyponatremic patients with a cerebral lesion. However, the diagnostic criteria for CSWS have not been fully established. Thus, when hyponatremia is observed in patients with CSWS, they may be misdiagnosed as having the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Thus, it is critical to differentiate between these 2 conditions because their treatments are diametrically opposed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of 45 patients with CSWS and compared them to 60 normonatremic control patients, and 28 patients with SIADH. All patients had their 24-hour urine volumes and sodium (Na) excretion measured.RESULTS: In patients with CSWS, urinary Na excretion was 394 \xc2\xb1 369mmol/24 hours and urinary volume was 2,603 \xc2\xb1 996mL/24 hours; both values significantly greater than in controls (P<0.01). By contrast, in patients with SIADH, the urine Na excretion was only 51 \xc2\xb1 25mmol/24 hours and urine volume was 745 \xc2\xb1 298mL/24 hours; values significantly lower than in patients with CSWS (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: CSWS was diagnosed in patients with cerebral lesion who had (1) symptomatic hyponatremia, (2) urine Na excretion 2 standard deviations above controls and (3) increased urine volume. Patients with SIADH also had symptomatic hyponatremia but, in contrast to patients with CSWS, they had decreased Na excretion and urine volume. Thus urine Na excretion and volume are very important for diagnosing the cause of hyponatremia in patients with cerebral lesions. labels: #Brain Diseases#Female#Humans#Hyponatremia#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Sodium#Syndrome'
b'BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and specific microvascular complication of diabetes. The association of bone metabolic markers with the risk of DR and diabetic macular edema (DME) is unclear.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the association between bone turnover markers commonly examined in a clinical setting and DR and DME risk in elderly Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 408 patients aged 55-70 years with T2DM were included. We first performed univariable logistic regression followed by multivariable logistic regression that included variables selected using purposeful selection.RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose (P = 0.007) and duration of diabetes (P<0.0001) were significantly associated with DME in multivariable logistic regression; however, the association of beta C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (\xce\xb2-CTx) with DME risk was not statistically significant (P = 0.053). Sex-stratified analysis showed that \xce\xb2-CTx was significantly associated with DME only in female subjects (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: \xce\xb2-CTx had no significant association with DR. It was significantly associated with DME in female patients with T2DM, but not in male patients with T2DM. More prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate our findings. labels: #Aged#Biomarkers#Blood Glucose#Bone Remodeling#Collagen Type I#Cross-Sectional Studies#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Diabetic Retinopathy#Female#Humans#Macular Edema#Male#Middle Aged#Peptides#Sex Factors'
b'BACKGROUND: Despite a rise in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), data on HCC-related hospitalizations and financial burden are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate temporal trends of HCC-related hospitalizations and evaluate its financial influence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the diagnosis of HCC, as reported by International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision code, were identified from the National Inpatient Sample databases from 2002-2011. The national estimates of hospitalizations were derived using appropriate sample weights. The change in total average charges per each hospitalization over the study period was calculated after adjusting for inflation.RESULTS: Hospitalizations related to HCC have increased from 24,024 in 2002 to 50,609 in 2011. Of these admissions, HCC was the principal diagnosis in 10,762 and 16,350 subjects in 2002 and 2011, respectively. Most were white males (male: 70%; white: 55%). The overall inpatient mortality was significantly decreased from 13.5% in 2002 to 9.9% in 2011 (P<0.01). The same trend was also observed for the length of hospital stay (6.5 versus 5.6 days in 2002 and 2011, respectively). The inflation-adjusted cost per hospitalization increased by approximately 47% during the study period.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the decrease in mortality rate and length-of-stay, hospitalizations and financial burden associated with HCC continued to increase between 2002 and 2011 in the United States. labels: #Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Cost of Illness#Female#Hospitalization#Humans#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#United States'
b"BACKGROUND: Variation in baseline ear temperature, taken in the unadjusted mode, has yet to be established in different age groups. Because normal body temperatures show large variations, the same may be expected for increased temperatures in fever. The aims were to study variations in normothermic body temperatures measured with an ear thermometer and to determine differences between actual and perceived body temperature during a febrile episode (referred to as difftemp) in apparently healthy children and adults.METHODS: Ear temperature was measured once in 2,006 individuals (61.7% females): 683 children aged 2 and 4 years, 492 adolescents aged 10-18 years, 685 adults aged 19-65 years and 146 elderly aged 66-89 years. Difftemp was estimated as the difference between the individual's ear body temperature, measured in the present study, and the respondent's reported temperature when feverish.RESULTS: Mean ear temperature was 36.4 \xc2\xb1 0.6\xc2\xb0C overall and in the child and adult groups. In adolescents, it was 36.5 \xc2\xb1 0.5\xc2\xb0C, and in elderly, 36.1 \xc2\xb1 0.5\xc2\xb0C. Temperature in men was 36.3 \xc2\xb1 0.6\xc2\xb0C, and in women, 36.5 \xc2\xb1 0.5\xc2\xb0C. Difftemp was 1.1 \xc2\xb1 0.7\xc2\xb0C in adolescents, 1.5 \xc2\xb1 0.7\xc2\xb0C in children and adults, and 1.6 \xc2\xb1 0.7\xc2\xb0C in those>65 years.CONCLUSIONS: Ear body temperature is lower than traditionally reported and differs with age and sex. An individual difftemp of 1.0-1.5\xc2\xb0C along with malaise might indicate fever. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Age Factors#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Aging#Body Temperature#Child#Child, Preschool#Ear#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Sex Factors#Thermometers"
b"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, but the risk of IHD in Sj\xc3\xb6gren's syndrome (SjS) is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we estimated the prevalence and risk of IHD with SjS compared to controls from the general population using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample 2011 database.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project administrative longitudinal database contains encounter-level information on inpatient stays, emergency department visits and ambulatory surgery in all U.S. hospitals. We conducted a cross-sectional study among the inpatient population diagnosed with SjS and matched 1:4 with controls for age, sex and hospital region. Odds ratio for IHD was calculated as cases compared to controls. The contribution of various risk factors to IHD was also evaluated by logistic regression.RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated that 7,154 of 13,086 cases (54.7%) of SjS had IHD compared to 27,367 of 52,448 controls (52.2%). The adjusted odds ratio for IHD in those with SjS was 0.898 (95% CI: 0.844-0.955). Patients with SjS were significantly more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, apnea and lipid disorders.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest population-based study investigating the risk of IHD in patients with SjS. We found a modest, though statistically significant, decrease in the risk of IHD in SjS compared to controls. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Cross-Sectional Studies#Databases, Factual#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Myocardial Ischemia#Risk Factors#Sjogren's Syndrome#United States"
b'BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is commonly associated with cognitive dysfunction, which is more apparent in severe OSA and impairs quality of life. However, the clinical screening methods for these impairments in OSA are still limited. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using the Memory and Executive Screening (MES) for assessing cognitive performance in OSA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with nonsevere OSA and 36 patients with severe OSA participated in this study. All participants underwent comprehensive, laboratory-based polysomnography and completed assessments of cognitive function, which included both the MES and the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ).RESULTS: Both the total MES scores and 5 recall scores of the MES (MES-5R) were significantly lower in the severe OSA group than those in the nonsevere OSA group. The patients with severe OSA performed worse on the memory subtests of the MES-5R, especially on immediate recall. The sensitivity and specificity of the MES for identifying cognitive impairment in patients with OSA were 63.89% and 66.67%, respectively, for a cutoff value of<92 out of 100 points. An optimal cutoff between nonsevere and severe OSA was also set at 45 points (MES-5R) and at 0.94 points (MES ratio). Compared with the MES, the MoCA-BJ had similar sensitivity (61.11%) and specificity (66.67%).CONCLUSIONS: The MES is an acceptable tool for detecting cognitive dysfunction in patients with OSA. The sensitivity and specificity of the MES were similar to those of the MoCA-BJ. The MES-5R and total MES scores can assess the presence and severity of cognitive impairment in patients with severe OSA. labels: #Adult#Cognitive Dysfunction#Humans#Male#Memory#Middle Aged#Quality of Life#Sleep Apnea, Obstructive'
b'BACKGROUND: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has emerged as a noninvasive method for assessing inflammation in lung diseases. Our aim is to investigate the correlation between tumor necrosis factor \xce\xb1 (TNF-\xce\xb1) and interleukin 1\xce\xb2 (IL-1\xce\xb2) in EBC and in lung tissue, and between these values in EBC with pulmonary function tests in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: To ensure the availability of lung tissue, 60 patients undergoing resection for early lung cancer were divided into 3 groups: a COPD treatment group, a COPD control group and a non-COPD group. Patients in the COPD treatment group received what was termed "lung-protective treatment" including ambroxol, budesonide and ipratropium bromide in addition to chest physiotherapy. Patients underwent pulmonary function testing and EBC collection, and TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 in lung tissues were evaluated by immunoflorescense. Correlations were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficients.RESULTS: The TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 levels in EBC were significantly higher in the COPD groups compared with the non-COPD group before surgery (all P<0.01), and the levels were significantly decreased after lung-protective treatment was received before surgery (all P<0.01). TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 levels in EBC were significantly decreased in all patients after surgery with lung-protective treatment (P = 0.027, P = 0.004). TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 content in lung tissues was significantly higher in the COPD groups (all P<0.05), and the histologic analysis showed similar results. Negative correlations between FEV1/FVC and expression of TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 were observed. There was a positive correlation between TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 in lung tissues and in EBC.CONCLUSIONS: TNF-\xce\xb1 and IL-1\xce\xb2 in EBC are potential biomarkers for evaluating pulmonary function and inflammation in patients with COPD. Furthermore, lung-protective treatment is effective in reducing inflammation in patients with COPD. labels: #Aged#Ambroxol#Breath Tests#Budesonide#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Female#Humans#Interleukin-1beta#Ipratropium#Male#Middle Aged#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive#Retrospective Studies#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha'
b'BACKGROUND: Colon cancer is a major health problem worldwide. Available treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and anticancer drugs are limited due to stage of cancer, side effects and altered biodistribution. The use of peptides extracted from natural products has appeared as a potential therapy. Gloriosa superba is known to contain colchicine and other alkaloids with anticancer activity. However, these peptides contained within the extracts have not been studied. This study, therefore, focuses on an investigation of anti-colon cancer activity from a partially purified protein hydrolysate of G superba rhizome.METHODS: Dried G superba rhizome was extracted using 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate and digested with pepsin. The protein hydrolysates with molecular weight lesser than 3kDa were collected and subjected for cell viability assay. Then, the partial purification of the protein hydrolysate was performed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Fractions containing anticancer peptides were investigated, and their effects on apoptosis and protein expression using apoptosis test and Western blot, respectively.RESULTS: Partially purified peptides of G superba rhizome demonstrated anticolon activity in SW620 cells by inducing apoptosis through upregulation of p53 and downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\xce\xbaB).CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, G superba peptides showed high potential for further purification and development of anticolon therapeutics. labels: #Animals#Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic#Apoptosis#Cell Line, Tumor#Cercopithecus aethiops#Colchicaceae#Colonic Neoplasms#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Humans#Peptides#Plant Proteins#Rhizome#Tumor Suppressor Protein p53#Up-Regulation#Vero Cells'
b'BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a kind of polyphenol, has the potential to activate the longevity gene in several cells, in the same manner as calorie restriction. We investigated the effect of resveratrol and \xcf\x89-3-line polyunsaturated fatty acid on surtuin 1 (SIRT1) gene expression in human monocytes (THP1) cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the gene expression of THP1 cells using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis. Resveratol, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaeanoic acid (DHA) as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid were added on THP1 cells. We observed the changes in the SIRT1 gene expression in those cells, under various doses of agents and in time courses. Then, we examined the interaction of glucose and mannitol on those agents\xd7\xb3 effect of the gene expression. The concentration range of glucose and mannitol was from 5-20mM, respectively.RESULTS: The SIRT1 gene expression could be defined in 24 and 48 hours both in real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and in Western blotting. Resveratrol showed SIRT1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 0-20\xce\xbcM in both analyses. Although EPA at 10\xce\xbcM showed marked increase in SIRT1 gene expression compared to control condition in Western blotting, this phenomenon was not in dose-dependent manner. DHA did not exhibit any augmentation of SIRT1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 0-20\xce\xbcM in both analyses. We refined the dose-dependent inhibition of the SIRT1 gene expression within 20mM glucose medium. Although 20mM did not exhibit any inhibition, 10\xce\xbcM resveratrol induced the gene expression compared to control medium. Both 5 and 15mM mannitol medium did not significantly alter basic gene expression and 10\xce\xbcM resveratrol-induced gene expression.CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that resveratrol and EPA, but not DHA, markedly activated the SIRT1 gene expression in THP1 cells, and that high glucose medium could inhibit the basic gene expression, but not powerful resveratrol-induced gene expression, in those cells. labels: #Cell Line, Tumor#Docosahexaenoic Acids#Dose-Response Relationship, Drug#Eicosapentaenoic Acid#Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic#Glucose#Humans#Mannitol#Monocytes#Sirtuin 1#Stilbenes'
b'BACKGROUND: Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene (MIC) polymorphisms have been associated with many autoimmune diseases. To explore the correlation between MIC polymorphisms and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we compared the sequence of the MIC gene in Han Chinese patients with SLE from Hainan Island, China, with healthy individuals.METHODS: In this study, the MIC polymorphisms in 296 subjects (159 patients with SLE and 137 healthy volunteers) of Han ethnicity from Hainan Island were characterized. A chi-square test was performed to evaluate the differences in the allelic frequency of the MIC genes between patients with SLE and the control subjects.RESULTS: The genotyping results indicated that the frequencies of the MICA*010, MICB*014, and MICB*002 alleles were significantly higher in the control subjects than the patients with SLE. Additionally, the results also indicated that the frequency of the MICB*009N in the SLE group was significantly increased compared to that in the matched control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that the MICB*009N allele might be a risk factor for SLE, whereas the MICB*014, MICA*010 and MICB*002 alleles were associated with reduced incidence of SLE in the study population. labels: #Adult#Aged#Alleles#Asian Continental Ancestry Group#China#Female#Gene Frequency#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Histocompatibility Antigens Class I#Humans#Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic#Male#Middle Aged#Polymorphism, Genetic'
b'PURPOSE: Masticatory muscle pain disorders respond well to conservative therapy; however, in some patients the pain becomes refractory. Botulinum toxin type A (BoT-A) therapy has been shown to be an effective modality in the management of refractory headache disorders. Conversely, there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the efficacy, safety, and predictors of therapeutic response to BoT-A therapy for management of refractory masticatory muscle pain.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent at least 2 injection cycles of 100 U of BoT-A for refractory masticatory myalgia in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, between May 2012 and June 2016. Information regarding demographic, diagnostic, and therapeutic characteristics was extracted and analyzed. The \xcf\x872test was used for analysis between independent and dependent variables. Forward step-wise-type logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of outcome.RESULTS: Among 116 participants, 30.6% reported significant relief in pain for a mean period of 10.1\xc2\xa0weeks. A total of 16.4% of participants reported at least 1 adverse effect. The effectiveness of the\xc2\xa0BoT-A therapy was found to be statistically associated with the presence of muscle hypertrophy (P\xc2\xa0= .004), range of motion (P\xc2\xa0= .02), concurrent use of opioid analgesics (P\xc2\xa0= .003), and local anesthetic trigger-point injections (P\xc2\xa0= .003). Logistic regression analyses suggested that the presence of muscle hypertrophy and occurrence of adverse effects were predictors of positive outcome. On the contrary, concurrent use of opioid analgesics was found to be a predictor for no or minimal relief.CONCLUSIONS: BoT-A therapy provides significant relief for approximately one third of patients with refractory masticatory muscle pain. Therapy is associated with a mild risk of adverse effects. The presence of muscle hypertrophy, occurrence of an adverse effect, and concurrent use of opioid analgesics were found to be predictors of outcome response. labels: #Botulinum Toxins, Type A#Female#Forecasting#Humans#Male#Masticatory Muscles#Middle Aged#Myalgia#Neuromuscular Agents#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Sclerotherapy has been described as a treatment option for nonparasitic pediatric splenic cysts; however, there are limited data on its long-term effectiveness.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review and prospective follow-up imaging study of children treated for nonparasitic splenic cysts at our institution during 2006-2015. Included patients had International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code 289.59 or 759.0 and underwent either sclerotherapy or a partial splenic operation (partial splenectomy, cyst excision, or marsupialization). Charts were reviewed for demographics, imaging, treatments, and complications. Identified patients were contacted and asked to return for splenic ultrasonography.RESULTS: Six surgical patients and 19 sclerotherapy patients were identified. Sclerotherapy patients underwent a median of four treatments with a decrease in the size of the cyst or complete ablation in 89.5% (17/19). Of the two patients who underwent unsuccessful sclerotherapy, one patient had sclerotherapy with sotradecol and ethanol for eight treatments, developed infection, and underwent total splenectomy. The other patient did not improve with sclerotherapy and underwent partial splenectomy. Nine patients (eight patients treated with sclerotherapy and one patient treated with partial splenectomy) were successfully contacted and underwent follow-up imaging at a median follow-up of 2.4\xc2\xa0y since last treatment. Of the eight patients treated with sclerotherapy, four patients remained cyst-free, three had small residual asymptomatic cysts stable in size, and one developed a recurrent small asymptomatic cyst; the patient treated with surgery had no recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Sclerotherapy appears to be an effective and durable alternative treatment for children with splenic cysts. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Cysts#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Male#Prospective Studies#Recurrence#Retrospective Studies#Sclerotherapy#Splenectomy#Splenic Diseases#Treatment Outcome#Ultrasonography'
b'BACKGROUND: Energy-based devices are used in nearly every laparoscopic operation. Radiofrequency energy can transfer to nearby instruments via antenna and capacitive coupling without direct contact. Previous studies have described inadvertent energy transfer through bundled cords and nonelectrically active wires. The purpose of this study was to describe a new mechanism of stray energy transfer from the monopolar instrument through the operating surgeon to the laparoscopic telescope and propose practical measures to decrease the risk of injury.METHODS: Radiofrequency energy was delivered to a laparoscopic L-hook (monopolar "bovie"), an advanced bipolar device, and an ultrasonic device in a laparoscopic simulator. The tip of a 10-mm telescope was placed adjacent but not touching bovine liver in a standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy setup. Temperature increase was measured as tissue temperature from baseline nearest the tip of the telescope which was never in contact with the energy-based device after a 5-s open-air activation.RESULTS: The monopolar L-hook increased tissue temperature adjacent to the camera/telescope tip by 47\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xb0C from baseline (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). By having an assistant surgeon hold the camera/telescope (rather than one surgeon holding both the active electrode and the camera/telescope), temperature change was reduced to 26\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa07\xc2\xb0C (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Alternative energy devices significantly reduced temperature change in comparison to the monopolar instrument (47\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa08\xc2\xb0C) for both the advanced bipolar (1.2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.5\xc2\xb0C; P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) and ultrasonic (0.6\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.3\xc2\xb0C; P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) devices.CONCLUSIONS: Stray energy transfers from the monopolar "bovie" instrument through the operating surgeon to standard electrically inactive laparoscopic instruments. Hand-to-hand coupling describes a new form of capacitive coupling where the surgeon\'s body acts as an electrical conductor to transmit energy. Strategies to reduce stray energy transfer include avoiding the same surgeon holding the active electrode and laparoscopic camera or using alternative energy devices. labels: #Animals#Burns, Electric#Cattle#Electrosurgery#Energy Transfer#Hand#Humans#Laparoscopy#Liver#Occupational Injuries#Surgeons'
b'BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the rate of 30-d hospital readmissions after ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2009 to 2011 State Ambulatory Surgery and Services and State Inpatient Databases from California, Florida, and New York were analyzed to evaluate the incidence of 30-d readmissions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in outpatient settings. Hospital transfers and the principal diagnoses of hospital readmission were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Multilevel generalized mixed linear regression analyses with fixed and random effects were used to evaluate variables associated with increased likelihood of readmissions.RESULTS: A total of 230,745 encounters for ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in 890 ambulatory facilities between 2009 and 2011 in the three states were analyzed. The rate of 30-d readmission was 20.2 per 1000 discharges. The rate of direct transfers from the ambulatory surgery center to an acute care hospital was 0.6 per 1000 discharges. The most common diagnoses of readmission were surgical complications, postoperative pain, infection, and nausea or vomiting. After adjusting for comorbidities, increasing age, male sex, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, any nonprivate insurance type, diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, use of intraoperative cholangiography, and having the procedure performed on a weekend were significantly associated with increased odds of 30-d readmissions.CONCLUSIONS: This large-state data analysis reveals that the unplanned admission and readmission rates after laparoscopic cholecystectomy are very low. Some causes of readmission (e.g., pain, nausea, and vomiting) are modifiable by the intervention of surgeons and anesthesia providers. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Ambulatory Surgical Procedures#Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic#Databases, Factual#Female#Humans#Incidence#Linear Models#Male#Middle Aged#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Patient Readmission#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#United States#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: The best operative strategy for necrotizing pancreatitis remains controversial. Traditional surgical necrosectomy is associated with significant morbidity; endoscopic and percutaneous strategies require repeated interventions with prolonged hospitalizations. We have developed a transgastric approach to pancreatic necrosectomy to overcome the shortcomings of the other techniques described.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with necrotizing pancreatitis treated from 2009 to 2016 at an academic center were retrospectively reviewed. Open or laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy was performed if the area of necrosis was walled-off and in a retrogastric position on cross-sectional imaging. Study endpoints included postoperative complications and mortality.RESULTS: Forty-six patients underwent transgastric necrosectomy (nine open and 37 laparoscopic). Median (interquartile range) preoperative Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 6 (3-12). Seventy percent of patients had>30% necrosis on preoperative imaging; infected necrosis was present in 35%. Median total length of stay (LOS) was 6 (3-12) d. No patient required a second operative debridement; four patients (9%) had short-term postoperative percutaneous drainage for residual fluid collections. Median follow-up was 1\xc2\xa0y; there were no fistula or wound complications. Six patients (13%) had postoperative bleeding; five patients received treatment by image-guided embolization. There was one death in the cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Transgastric pancreatic necrosectomy allows for effective debridement with a single definitive operation. When anatomically suitable, this operative strategy offers expedited recovery and avoids long-term morbidity associated with fistulas and prolonged drainage. labels: #Adult#Aged#Debridement#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Laparoscopy#Male#Middle Aged#Pancreatectomy#Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies#Stomach#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) imaging has an established role in the initial evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. What is less clear is the role of CT in guiding delayed exploration in patients initially managed nonoperatively after blunt trauma. We hypothesized that a repeat CT would accurately identify the need for an exploratory laparotomy in this patient population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2014, we reviewed all blunt abdominal trauma patients at our institution who received an admission CT scan. We identified patients who underwent repeat CT of the abdomen within 72\xc2\xa0h for the documented purpose of reevaluating potential intra-abdominal injuries. CT findings were categorized as either having a CT indication for exploration or not, allowing a sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: Of the 50 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 9 underwent surgical exploration of the abdomen and 41 did not. Admission clinical indicators such as Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and vitals were similar between the operative and nonoperative groups (P\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.05). When compared with initial CT scan, repeat scan was found to increase the sensitivity from 67% to 100%, while also improving the specificity to 86%, positive predictive value to 50%, and negative predictive value to 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Repeat CT scan of the abdomen may be useful in evaluating blunt trauma patients initially managed nonoperatively. The second CT scan increases the sensitivity of CT evaluation to 100% while also improving the specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. labels: #Abdominal Injuries#Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Delayed Diagnosis#Female#Humans#Laparotomy#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Wounds, Nonpenetrating#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: Rapidly resolving acute subdural hematomas (RRASDHs) have been described in case reports and case series but are still poorly understood. We hypothesized that a cohort analysis would confirm previously reported predictors of RRASDH including coagulopathy, additional intracranial hemorrhage, and low-density band on imaging. We also hypothesized that rapid resolution would be associated with improved trauma outcomes.METHODS: We reviewed all nonoperative acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) treated at our center from 2011 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were ASDH on computed tomography (CT), admission Glasgow coma score>7, and repeat CT to evaluate ASDH change. RRASDH was defined as reduced hematoma thickness by 50% within 72\xc2\xa0h. Clinical data, CT findings, and trauma end points were analyzed for the RRASDH and nonresolving groups.RESULTS: There were 154 ASDH patients included, with 29 cases of RRASDH. The RRASDH group had a lower rate of comorbidities than the nonresolving group (58.6% versus 78.4%, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.03) and a lower rate of prehospital anticoagulation (7.7% versus 37.1%, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.004). Previously reported predictors of RRASDH did not differ between the groups, nor did any clinical outcome measures. When compared with patients who experienced rapid growth (>50% increased width in 72\xc2\xa0h), the RRASDH group had lower mortality (3.4% versus 23.5%, P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.04).CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest review of RRASDHs. We identified two previously unrecognized factors that may predict resolution; however, previously reported predictors were not associated with resolution. We also found no relationship between RRASDHs and improved standard trauma outcomes, calling into question the clinical significance of RRASDH. labels: #Adult#Aged, 80 and over#Female#Glasgow Coma Scale#Hematoma, Subdural, Acute#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Remission, Spontaneous#Retrospective Studies#Tomography, X-Ray Computed'
b'Metabolic health and positive symptom severity has been investigated in schizophrenia, but not in clinical high risk (CHR) patients. We hypothesized that greater body mass index (BMI) in CHR patients would be related to less positive symptoms. We examined this relationship in CHR patients being treated with 1) no psychotropic medications (n = 58), 2) an antipsychotic (n = 14), or 3) an antidepressant without an antipsychotic (n = 10). We found no relationship between BMI and positive symptoms in unmedicated CHR patients, the majority of whom had a narrow BMI range between 20 and 30. However, in the smaller sample of CHR patients taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, BMI was negatively correlated with positive symptoms. Although potentially underpowered, these preliminary findings provide initial steps in elucidating the relationships between metabolic health, neurochemistry, and symptom severity in CHR patients. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Antidepressive Agents#Antipsychotic Agents#Body Mass Index#Female#Humans#Male#Psychiatric Status Rating Scales#Psychotic Disorders#Risk Factors#Severity of Illness Index#Young Adult'
b'Self-harm refers to the purposeful destruction of bodily tissue without suicidal intention and for purposes that are not socially sanctioned. Little is known about the associations between a history of self-harm, mood symptoms, and functioning in adults with different types of mood disorders. Lifetime histories of self-harm, current mood symptoms, global functioning, and affective traits were collected on 142 adults with mood disorders. The prevalence of lifetime self-harm was higher in patients with bipolar disorder compared with patients with a unipolar depressive disorder. Self-harm was also more strongly linked to impulsivity in individuals with bipolar disorder compared with unipolar depressive disorder. Across both diagnoses, histories of self-harm were related to lower levels of current global functioning, more severe depressive symptoms, and high self-reported emotional dysregulation and neuroticism. Findings indicate that self-harm is a potent prognostic variable for symptoms, global functioning, and personality functioning in individuals with mood disorders. labels: #Adult#Affect#Bipolar Disorder#Depressive Disorder#Female#Humans#Impulsive Behavior#Male#Personality Assessment#Psychiatric Status Rating Scales#Psychological Tests#Self-Injurious Behavior#Severity of Illness Index#Social Adjustment'
b'BACKGROUND: Hantavirus, the hemorrhagic causative agent of two clinical diseases, is found worldwide with variation in severity, incidence and mortality. The most lethal hantaviruses are found on the American continent where the most prevalent viruses like Andes virus and Sin Nombre virus are known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. New World hantavirus infection of immunocompetent hamsters results in an asymptomatic infection except for Andes virus and Maporal virus; the only hantaviruses causing a lethal disease in immunocompetent Syrian hamsters mimicking hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Hamsters, immunosuppressed with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, were infected intramuscularly with different New World hantavirus strains (Bayou virus, Black Creek Canal virus, Ca\xc3\xb1o Delgadito virus, Choclo virus, Laguna Negra virus, and Maporal virus). In the present study, we show that immunosuppression of hamsters followed by infection with a New World hantavirus results in an acute disease that precisely mimics both hantavirus disease in humans and Andes virus infection of hamsters.CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: Infected hamsters showed specific clinical signs of disease and moreover, histological analysis of lung tissue showed signs of pulmonary edema and inflammation within alveolar septa. In this study, we were able to infect immunosuppressed hamsters with different New World hantaviruses reaching a lethal outcome with signs of disease mimicking human disease. labels: #Animals#Anti-Inflammatory Agents#Cricetinae#Cyclophosphamide#Dexamethasone#Disease Models, Animal#Female#Hantavirus#Hantavirus Infections#Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome#Humans#Immunocompromised Host#Immunosuppression#Immunosuppressive Agents#Lung#Mesocricetus#Survival Analysis'
b"This is the first integrated study of the effects on gastric secretion, inflammation and fundic mucins after infection with L3 T. circumcincta and in the very early period following transplantation of adult worms. At 3 months-of-age, 20 Coopworth lambs were infected intraruminally with 35,000 L3; infected animals were killed on Days 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 post-infection and 6 controls on either Day 0 or 30 post-infection. Another 15 Romney cross lambs received 10,000 adult worms at 4-5 months-of-age though surgically-implanted abomasal cannulae and were killed after 6, 12, 24 and 72 hours; uninfected controls were also killed at 72 hours. Blood was collected at regular intervals from all animals for measurement of serum gastrin and pepsinogen and abomasal fluid for pH measurement from cannulated sheep. Tissues collected at necropsy were fixed in Bouin's fluid for light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and mucin staining and in Karnovsky's fluid for electron microscopy. Nodules around glands containing developing larvae were seen on Day 5 p.i., but generalised effects on secretion occurred only after parasite emergence and within hours after transplantation of adult worms. After L3 infection, there were maximum worm burdens on Days 10-15 post-infection, together with peak tissue eosinophilia, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, hypergastrinaemia, hyperpepsinogenaemia, loss of parietal cells, enlarged gastric pits containing less mucin and increased numbers of mucous neck cells. After adult transplantation, serum pepsinogen was significantly increased after 9 hours and serum gastrin after 18 hours. Parallel changes in host tissues and the numbers of parasites in the abomasal lumen suggest that luminal parasites, but not those in the tissues, are key drivers of the pathophysiology and inflammatory response in animals exposed to parasites for the first time. These results are consistent with initiation of the host response by parasite chemicals diffusing across the surface epithelium, possibly aided by components of ES products which increased permeability. Parietal cells appear to be a key target, resulting in secondary increases in serum gastrin, pit elongation, loss of surface mucins and inhibition of chief cell maturation. Inflammation occurs in parallel, and could either cause the pathology or exacerbate the direct effects of ES products. labels: #Animals#Gastric Mucins#Gastrins#Larva#Pepsinogen A#Sheep#Sheep Diseases#Stomach Diseases#Stomach, Ruminant#Trichostrongyloidea#Trichostrongyloidiasis"
b'The new-shoot-growing stage is an important period of apple tree nutrition distribution. The objective of this study is to provide technical support for apple tree nutrition diagnosis by constructing quantitative evaluation models between the apple leaf nitrogen content during the new-shoot-growing stage and characteristic spectral parameters. The correlation coefficients between the original spectral data and the nitrogen content were calculated. Then, the sensitive bands of the nitrogen content were selected using the theory of two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy. Finally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine (SVM) evaluation models were established using 2 parameters: Rx (maximum spectral reflectivity in the waveband) and Sx (total spectral reflectivity in the waveband). The results showed that the sensitive bands in the 2D correlation synchronous and asynchronous spectrograms were 537-560 nm and 708-719 nm. The PLSR model can be used to estimate the nitrogen content. Compared with PLSR, SVM provided better modeling and testing results, with a larger coefficient of determination (R2) and a smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE). The SVM model based on Sx was a good backup method. The calibration R2 of the model was 0.821, its RMSE was 0.710 g\xc2\xb7kg-1, the validation R2 was 0.768, and its RMSE was 1.019 g\xc2\xb7kg-1. The SVM model based on 2D correlation spectroscopy can be used to quantitatively estimate the nitrogen content in apple leaves. labels: #Biobehavioral Sciences#Malus#Nitrogen#Plant Leaves#Plant Shoots#Spectrum Analysis'
b'PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of birth weight on ocular morphology, refraction and visual function in early adolescents aged 12-15 years.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis using the public use files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of the period from 1999 to 2008. Study participants aged 12 to 15 years were included with data on birth weight and ophthalmic parameters including presenting distance visual acuity, objective refraction and keratometry. Visual acuity, sphere, astigmatism in power vectors J0 and J45, corneal power and corneal astigmatism were evaluated for an association with birth weight. Linear and logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, survey cycle and birth weight as independent variable were calculated.RESULTS: Linear regression analysis revealed an association between corneal power and birth weight (per 100g: beta = -0.04, p<0.001) in the univariate analysis, and in the model adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and NHANES survey cycle (per 100g: beta = -0.04, p<0.001). A lower birth weight was associated with higher corneal power. We found no evidence for an association of visual acuity, sphere, spherical equivalent, J0-vector and J45-vector of astigmatism, corneal J0- or corneal J45-vector with birth weight.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that low BW is linked to alterations in keratometric power even in early adolescents aged 12-15 years whereas visual acuity and refractive error showed no association. labels: #Adolescent#Age Factors#Astigmatism#Birth Weight#Child#Child, Preschool#Cornea#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Male#Refraction, Ocular#Sex Factors#United States#Vision, Ocular'
b'Cellular permissiveness to HIV infection is highly heterogeneous across individuals. Heterogeneity is also found across CD4+ T cells from the same individual, where only a fraction of cells gets infected. To explore the basis of permissiveness, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of non-infected CD4+ T cells from high and low permissive individuals. Transcriptional heterogeneity translated in a continuum of cell states, driven by T-cell receptor-mediated cell activation and was strongly linked to permissiveness. Proteins expressed at the cell surface and displaying the highest correlation with T cell activation were tested as biomarkers of cellular permissiveness to HIV. FACS sorting using antibodies against several biomarkers of permissiveness led to an increase of HIV cellular infection rates. Top candidate biomarkers included CD25, a canonical activation marker. The combination of CD25 high expression with other candidate biomarkers led to the identification of CD298, CD63 and CD317 as the best biomarkers for permissiveness. CD25highCD298highCD63highCD317high cell population showed an enrichment of HIV-infection of up to 28 fold as compared to the unsorted cell population. The purified hyper-permissive cell subpopulation was characterized by a downregulation of interferon-induced genes and several known restriction factors. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis coupled with functional characterization of cell biomarkers provides signatures of the "HIV-permissive cell". labels: #CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes#Cells, Cultured#HIV Infections#HIV-1#Humans#Lymphocyte Activation#Single-Cell Analysis#Virus Replication'
b'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver steatosis has shown to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between the presence and severity of CAD and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) assessed by transient elastography (TE) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP).METHODS: 576 Patients undergoing coronary angiography were enrolled in this prospective study, receiving at least 10 TE and CAP measurements using the FibroScan\xc2\xae M-probe. Clinically relevant CAD (CAD 3) was defined as stenosis with \xe2\x89\xa575% reduction of the luminal diameter. NAFLD was determined by CAP \xe2\x89\xa5234 dB/m. NAFLD with advanced fibrosiswas determined by TE-values \xe2\x89\xa57.9kPa in the presence of NAFLD and absence of congestive or right-sided heart failure. Rates and 95% confidence intervals are shown.RESULTS: 505 patients were available for analysis of NAFLD. However, only 392 patients were available for analysis of NAFLD with advanced fibrosis, since 24 patients had to be excluded due to non valid TE-measurements and 89 patients due to congestive or right-sided heart failure or suspected concomitant liver disease, respectively. 70.5% (66.3%-74.4%) of patients had CAD 3, 71.5% (67.3%-75.4%) were diagnosed with NAFLD, and 11.2% (8.3%-14.8%) with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. Patients with CAD 3 had higher median CAP-values (273\xc2\xb161 vs. 260\xc2\xb166 dB/m; p = 0.038) and higher degrees of steatosis as compared to patients without CAD 3. While NAFLD was significantly more often diagnosed in patients with CAD 3 (75.0% vs. 63.1%, p = 0.0068), no significant difference was found for NAFLD with advanced fibrosis (10.7% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.60).CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant CAD is frequently associated with the presence of NAFLD, but not NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Coronary Angiography#Coronary Artery Disease#Elasticity Imaging Techniques#Female#Humans#Liver Cirrhosis#Male#Middle Aged#Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease#Prospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index'
b'INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the effect of combining positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and mandibular advancement device (MAD) in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who were pressure intolerant for PAP and were unresponsive to MAD.METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of severe OSA patients with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \xe2\x89\xa5 30/hr who were diagnosed between October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2014. Patients were initially treated with 2 weeks of PAP, and those who were intolerant to high-pressure PAP (\xe2\x89\xa515 cm H2O) were switched to 12 weeks of MAD, which is a monobloc designed at 75% of maximum protrusion. Patients who had high residual AHI (\xe2\x89\xa515/hr) on MAD underwent 12 weeks of combination therapy (CT) with MAD and CPAP and were enrolled in the present study. Enrolled subjects who completed the 12-week CT were followed-up until June 30, 2016.RESULTS: A total of 14 male patients were included. All three treatments effectively reduced AHI, oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and total sleep time with SpO2<90% (% TST-SpO2<90%) compared to pretreatment values. The residual AHI and ODI on CT was lower than that on MAD or PAP. The residual % TST-SpO2<90% was lower than that on MAD and similar to that on PAP. The therapeutic pressure on CT was on average 9.2 cm H2O lower than that on PAP. For the 11 patients who completed CT, only CT reduced ESS compared to pretreatment value. No treatment had significant impact on % slow wave sleep or overnight change of blood pressure. For patients who completed CT, the average usage was 5.9\xc2\xb11.7 hr/night at 12th week and 6.4\xc2\xb11.5 hr/night at a median follow-up of 36.5-months.CONCLUSIONS: Combining MAD and CPAP showed additive effects on reducing AHI and ODI, and lowered the therapeutic pressures. labels: #Blood Pressure#Combined Modality Therapy#Continuous Positive Airway Pressure#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Male#Mandibular Advancement#Middle Aged#Patient Compliance#Retrospective Studies#Sleep Apnea, Obstructive#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Treatment Failure'
b"Human pegivirus (HPgV) protects HIV+ people from HIV-associated disease, but the mechanism of this protective effect remains poorly understood. We sequentially infected cynomolgus macaques with simian pegivirus (SPgV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to model HIV+HPgV co-infection. SPgV had no effect on acute-phase SIV pathogenesis-as measured by SIV viral load, CD4+ T cell destruction, immune activation, or adaptive immune responses-suggesting that HPgV's protective effect is exerted primarily during the chronic phase of HIV infection. We also examined the immune response to SPgV in unprecedented detail, and found that this virus elicits virtually no activation of the immune system despite persistently high titers in the blood over long periods of time. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the pegiviruses-an understudied group of viruses with a high prevalence in the global human population-and suggests that the protective effect observed in HIV+HPgV co-infected people occurs primarily during the chronic phase of HIV infection. labels: #Animals#Coinfection#Disease Models, Animal#Flaviviridae Infections#GB virus C#Macaca fascicularis#Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome#Simian Immunodeficiency Virus"
b'BACKGROUND: We assessed whether a short training, effective in a high resource country, was able to improve the quality of face-mask ventilation (FMV) in a low resource setting.METHODS: Local healthcare providers at the Centre M\xc3\xa9dico-Social, Kouv\xc3\xa8, Togo were asked to ventilate a neonatal leak-free manikin before (time-t1) and after (t2) a two-minute training session. Immediately after this section, a further two-minute training with participants aware of the data monitor was offered. Finally, a third 1-minute FMV round (t3) was performed by each participant. Ventilatory parameters were recorded using a computerized system. Primary outcome was the percentage of breaths with relevant mask leak (>25%). Secondary outcomes were percentages of breaths with a low peak inspiratory pressure (PIP<20 cm H2O), within the recommended PIP (20-35 cm H2O) and with a high PIP (>35 cm H2O).RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects participated in the study. The percentage of relevant mask leak significantly decreased (p<0.0001; \xce\xb2 = -0.76, SE = 0.10) from 89.7% (SD 21.5%) at t1 to 45.4% (SD 27.2%) at t2 and to 18.3% (SD 20.1%) at t3. The percentage of breaths within the recommended PIP significantly increased (p<0.0001; \xce\xb2 = +0.54, SE = 0.12). The percentage of breaths with PIP>35 cm H2O was 19.5% (SD 32.8%) at t1 and 39.2% (SD 37.7%) at t2 (padj = 0.27; \xce\xb2 = +0.61, SE = 0.36) and significantly decreased (padj = 0.01; \xce\xb2 = -1.61, SE = 0.55) to 6.0% (SD 15.4%) at t3.CONCLUSIONS: A 2-minute training on FMV, effective in a high resource country, had a positive effect also in a low resource setting. FMV performance further improved after an extra 2-minute verbal recall plus real time feedback. Although the training was extended, it still does not cost much time and effort. Further studies are needed to establish if these basic skills are transferred in real patients and if they are maintained over time. labels: #Adult#Education, Medical, Continuing#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Personnel, Hospital#Respiration, Artificial#Togo'
b'Fusarium fujikuroi causes bakanae ("foolish seedling") disease of rice which is characterized by hyper-elongation of seedlings resulting from production of gibberellic acids (GAs) by the fungus. This plant pathogen is also known for production of harmful mycotoxins, such as fusarins, fusaric acid, apicidin F and beauvericin. Recently, we generated the first de novo genome sequence of F. fujikuroi strain IMI 58289 combined with extensive transcriptional, epigenetic, proteomic and chemical product analyses. GA production was shown to provide a selective advantage during infection of the preferred host plant rice. Here, we provide genome sequences of eight additional F. fujikuroi isolates from distant geographic regions. The isolates differ in the size of chromosomes, most likely due to variability of subtelomeric regions, the type of asexual spores (microconidia and/or macroconidia), and the number and expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters. Whilst most of the isolates caused the typical bakanae symptoms, one isolate, B14, caused stunting and early withering of infected seedlings. In contrast to the other isolates, B14 produced no GAs but high amounts of fumonisins during infection on rice. Furthermore, it differed from the other isolates by the presence of three additional polyketide synthase (PKS) genes (PKS40, PKS43, PKS51) and the absence of the F. fujikuroi-specific apicidin F (NRPS31) gene cluster. Analysis of additional field isolates confirmed the strong correlation between the pathotype (bakanae or stunting/withering), and the ability to produce either GAs or fumonisins. Deletion of the fumonisin and fusaric acid-specific PKS genes in B14 reduced the stunting/withering symptoms, whereas deletion of the PKS51 gene resulted in elevated symptom development. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two subclades of F. fujikuroi strains according to their pathotype and secondary metabolite profiles. labels: #Fungal Proteins#Fusariosis#Fusarium#Genes, Fungal#Oryza#Phylogeny#Plant Diseases#Virulence'
b'Alpha herpesvirus genomes encode the capacity to establish quiescent infections (i.e. latency) in the peripheral nervous system for the life of their hosts. Multiple times during latency, viral genomes can reactivate to start a productive infection, enabling spread of progeny virions to other hosts. Replication of alpha herpesviruses is well studied in cultured cells and many aspects of productive replication have been identified. However, many questions remain concerning how a productive or a quiescent infection is established. While infections in vivo often result in latency, infections of dissociated neuronal cultures in vitro result in a productive infection unless lytic viral replication is suppressed by DNA polymerase inhibitors or interferon. Using primary peripheral nervous system neurons cultured in modified Campenot tri-chambers, we previously reported that reactivateable, quiescent infections by pseudorabies virus (PRV) can be established in the absence of any inhibitor. Such infections were established in cell bodies only when physically isolated axons were infected at a very low multiplicity of infection (MOI). In this report, we developed a complementation assay in compartmented neuronal cultures to investigate host and viral factors in cell bodies that prevent establishment of quiescent infection and promote productive replication of axonally delivered genomes (i.e. escape from silencing). Stimulating protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways in isolated cell bodies, or superinfecting cell bodies with either UV-inactivated PRV or viral light particles (LP) promoted escape from genome silencing and prevented establishment of quiescent infection but with different molecular mechanisms. Activation of PKA in cell bodies triggers a slow escape from silencing in a cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK) dependent manner. However, escape from silencing is induced rapidly by infection with UVPRV or LP in a PKA- and JNK-independent manner. We suggest that viral tegument proteins delivered to cell bodies engage multiple signaling pathways that block silencing of viral genomes delivered by low MOI axonal infection. labels: #Animals#Cells, Cultured#Gene Expression Regulation, Viral#Gene Silencing#Genome, Viral#Herpesvirus 1, Human#Herpesvirus 1, Suid#Neurons#Swine#Viral Proteins#Virus Latency#Virus Replication'
b'This study compared the effects of two levels of performance stabilization on the adaptation to unpredictable perturbations in an isometric control force task with the goal of controlling 40% of the maximum force. The experiment consisted of pre-exposure and exposure phases. In the pre-exposure two levels of performance stabilization were manipulated: a stabilization group (SG) performed three trials in a row while maintaining 40% of the maximum force for three seconds and an absolute error less than or equal to 5% (i.e., the criteria of performance), and a superstabilization group (SSG) performed six blocks of the same criteria. During the exposure phase, the task was the same as that in the pre-exposure phase; however, it was inserted 9 trials of perturbations when the task goal changed to 60% of the maximum force. We measured the %RMSE, RMS from the biceps and triceps brachii and co-contraction. In the pre-exposure phase, both groups showed similar performance and muscle activity. When exposed to the perturbations, SSG performance more quickly returned to the previous level of accuracy, showed lower muscle activation and demonstrated a greater muscle co-contraction than did SG. The results give support to the adaptive process model on motor learning. labels: #Adult#Electromyography#Humans#Isometric Contraction#Male#Motor Skills#Muscle, Skeletal#Task Performance and Analysis#Young Adult'
b'Intramuscular fat (IMF) is known to enhance beef palatability and can be markedly increased by castration. However, there is little understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the IMF deposition after castration of beef cattle. We hypothesize that genetic regulators function differently in IMF from bulls and steers. Therefore, after detecting serum testosterone and lipid parameter, as well as the contents of IMF at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, we have investigated differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs in IMF of bulls and steers at 24 months of age in Qinchuan cattle using next-generation sequencing, and then explored the possible biopathways regulating IMF deposition. Serum testosterone levels were significantly decreased in steers, whereas IMF content, serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) were markedly increased in steers. Comparing the results of steers and bulls, 580 upregulated genes and 1,120 downregulated genes in IMF tissues were identified as DE genes correlated with IMF deposition. The upregulated genes were mainly associated with lipid metabolism, lipogenesis and fatty acid transportation signalling pathways, and the downregulated genes were correlated with immune response and intracellular signal transduction. Concurrently, the DE miRNAs-important players in adipose tissue accumulation induced by castration-were also examined in IMF tissues; 52 DE miRNAs were identified. The expression profiles of selected genes and miRNAs were also confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Using integrated analysis, we constructed the microRNA-target regulatory network which was supported by target validation using the dual luciferase reporter system. Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to construct a molecular interaction network that could be involved in regulating IMF after castration. The detected molecular network is closely associated with lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation, which is supported by functional identification results of bta-let-7i on bovine preadipocytes. These results provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of the IMF phenotype differences between steers and bulls. labels: #Adipose Tissue#Animals#Cattle#China#Cholesterol#Male#MicroRNAs#Muscle, Skeletal#RNA, Messenger#Testosterone#Transcriptome#Triglycerides'
b'The influence of thrombosis on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) and the role of the commonest inherited thrombophilia abnormalities factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A in the development of thrombosis are unknown. We investigated a cohort of patients who underwent LT for HCC with the aim to estimate the incidence rate (IR) of thrombosis, its influence on mortality and re-transplantation rates and, in the frame of a nested case-control study, the role of thrombophilia in donors and recipients for the development of thrombosis. Four-hundred and thirty patients underwent LT and were followed for a median of 7.2 years. Twenty-six recipients (6%) developed thrombosis (IR 1.06 [95%CI: 0.71-1.53] per 100 pts-yr). Mortality rate after LT was 3.95 (95%CI: 3.22-4.79) per 100 pts-yr and was not influenced by thrombosis. Re-transplantation was planned for 33 patients and was more common in patients with thrombosis than in those without (HR 2.50 [95%CI: 0.87-7.17]). The risk of thrombosis was 4 times higher in recipients with thrombophilia than in those without (OR 4.23 [95%CI: 0.99-18.04]) and 6 times higher when the analysis was restricted to venous thrombosis (OR 6.26 [95%CI: 1.19-32.85]). The presence of inherited thrombophilia in the donors did not increase the risk of thrombosis of the recipient. In conclusion, thrombosis is a complication of 6% of patients transplanted for HCC and increases the risk of re-transplantation but not of mortality. The risk of thrombosis, particularly venous, is increased in the presence of thrombophilia abnormalities in the recipients. labels: #Aged#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Liver Neoplasms#Liver Transplantation#Male#Middle Aged#Postoperative Complications#Survival Rate#Thrombophilia#Thrombosis'
b'Pathogenic or non-pathogenic small (17 to 30 nt) and long (>200 nt) non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic level by interacting with host proteins. However, lack of suitable experimental system precludes the identification and evaluation of the functional significance of host proteins interacting with ncRNAs. In this study, we present a first report on the application of riboproteomics to identify host proteins interacting with small, highly pathogenic, noncoding satellite RNA (sat-RNA) associated with Cucumber mosaic virus, the helper virus (HV). RNA affinity beads containing sat-RNA transcripts of (+) or (-)-sense covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide activated sepharose beads were incubated with total protein extracts from either healthy or HV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. RNA-protein complexes bound to the beads were eluted and subjected to MudPIT analysis. Bioinformatics programs PANTHER classification and WoLF-PSORT were used to further classify the identified host proteins in each case based on their functionality and subcellular distribution. Finally, we observed that the host protein network interacting with plus and minus-strand transcripts of sat-RNA, in the presence or absence of HV is distinct, and the global interactome of host proteins interacting with satRNA in either of the orientations is very different. labels: #Cucumovirus#Helper Viruses#Plant Proteins#Proteomics#RNA, Untranslated#RNA, Viral#Tobacco'
b"5'-Phosphodiesterase (5'-PDE) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid to obtain a mixture of ribonucleotides, such as 5'-guanosine monophosphate and 5'-adenosine monophosphate. In this study, a 5'-PDE was newly isolated and purified from Aspergillus fumigatus. Following purification, this enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 1036.76 U/mg protein, a molecular weight of 9.5 kDa, and an optimal temperature and pH for enzyme activity of 60\xc2\xb0C and 5.0, respectively. However, its activity was partially inhibited by Fe3+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, but slightly improved by the presence of K+ and Na+. Additionally, chemical-modification experiments were also applied to investigate the structural information of 5'-PDE, in which the residues containing carboxyl and imidazole groups were essential for enzyme activity based on their localization in the 5'-PDE active site. Furthermore, purified 5'-PDE could specifically catalyze the synthesis of ribonucleotides with a Vmax 0.71 mmol/mg\xc2\xb7min and a KM of 13.60 mg/mL. labels: #Aspergillus fumigatus#Catalysis#Hydrolysis#Molecular Weight#Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases#Protein Conformation"
b'Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is the oldest model object of plant genetics and one of the most agriculturally important legumes in the world. Since the pea genome has not been sequenced yet, identification of genes responsible for mutant phenotypes or desirable agricultural traits is usually performed via genetic mapping followed by candidate gene search. Such mapping is best carried out using gene-based molecular markers, as it opens the possibility for exploiting genome synteny between pea and its close relative Medicago truncatula Gaertn., possessing sequenced and annotated genome. In the last 5 years, a large number of pea gene-based molecular markers have been designed and mapped owing to the rapid evolution of "next-generation sequencing" technologies. However, the access to the complete set of markers designed worldwide is limited because the data are not uniformed and therefore hard to use. The Pea Marker Database was designed to combine the information about pea markers in a form of user-friendly and practical online tool. Version 1 (PMD1) comprises information about 2484 genic markers, including their locations in linkage groups, the sequences of corresponding pea transcripts and the names of related genes in M. truncatula. Version 2 (PMD2) is an updated version comprising 15944 pea markers in the same format with several advanced features. To test the performance of the PMD, fine mapping of pea symbiotic genes Sym13 and Sym27 in linkage groups VII and V, respectively, was carried out. The results of mapping allowed us to propose the Sen1 gene (a homologue of SEN1 gene of Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen) as the best candidate gene for Sym13, and to narrow the list of possible candidate genes for Sym27 to ten, thus proving PMD to be useful for pea gene mapping and cloning.

b"AIM: To investigate how quality and patient safety domains are being taught in the pre-registration curricula of health profession education programmes in New Zealand.METHODS: All tertiary institutions providing training for medicine, nursing, midwifery, dentistry, pharmacy, physiotherapy, dietetics and 11 other allied health professions in New Zealand were contacted and a person with relevant curriculum knowledge was invited to participate. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide to explore nine quality and safety domains; improvement science, patient safety, quality and safety culture, evidence-based practice, patient-centred care, teamwork and communication, leadership for change, systems thinking and use of information technology (IT). Transcribed data were extracted and categorised by discipline and domain. Two researchers independently identified and categorised themes within each domain, using a general inductive approach.RESULTS: Forty-nine institutions were contacted and 43 (88%) people were interviewed. The inclusion and extent of quality and safety teaching was variable. Evidence-based practice, patient-centred care and teamwork and communication were the strongest domains and well embedded in programmes, while leadership, systems thinking and the role of IT were less explicitly included. Except for two institutions, improvement science was absent from pre-registration curricula. Patient safety teaching was focused mainly around incident reporting, and to a lesser extent learning from adverse events. Although a 'no blame' culture was articulated as important, the theme of individual accountability was still apparent. While participants agreed that all domains were important, the main barriers to incorporating improvement science and patient safety concepts into existing programmes included an 'already stretched curriculum' and having faculty with limited expertise in these areas.CONCLUSIONS: Although the building blocks for improving the quality and safety of healthcare are present, this national study of multiple health professional pre-registration education programmes has identified teaching gaps in patient safety and improvement science methods and tools. Failure to address these gaps will compromise the ability of new graduates to successfully implement and sustain improvements. labels: #Communication#Curriculum#Evidence-Based Practice#Health Personnel#Humans#Leadership#Medical Informatics#New Zealand#Organizational Culture#Patient Care Team#Patient Safety#Patient-Centered Care#Qualitative Research#Quality Improvement#Systems Analysis"
b'AIM: To determine the outcome of patients waitlisted for hip and knee replacement surgery who were returned to GP due to resource constraints.METHODS: Prospectively gathered data of all patients returned to GP was analysed, including demographics, clinical prioritisation scores and patient-reported scores. Subsequent outcome was collected from departmental records and the National Joint Registry.RESULTS: Between November 2013 and December 2015, 374 patients were returned to GP care. At minimum 12-month follow-up, 215 (57.5%) had undergone or had certainty for surgery, 36 patients (9.6%) had been re-referred and again declined surgery and 123 (32.9%) remained in GP care. The factors influencing the likelihood of a patient subsequently qualifying for surgery were need for hip rather than knee replacement, time from initial FSA and initial NZOA score. The mean waiting time for those patients who underwent publicly-funded surgery was 14.7 months.CONCLUSION: Returning patients to GP delays treatment rather than reducing the need for surgery. This delay results in waste, added costs to the patient, healthcare system and society, and may reduce the benefit of surgery. There needs to be a significant increase in capacity to meet this demand. labels: #Aged#Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip#Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee#Female#General Practice#Humans#Male#New Zealand#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Public Sector#Referral and Consultation#Waiting Lists'
b'AIMS: New Zealand follows the guideline that only patients with projected five-year survival of 80% are listed for deceased donor kidney transplantation. An algorithm derived from US data estimates survival after transplantation, however, this may not be as applicable to the New Zealand population. We review use of the US derived algorithm in New Zealand. We assessed accuracy of scores calculated by referring units and audited whether the system is applied in New Zealand.METHODS: Data on 422 patients assessed for transplantation was entered into the algorithm to calculate a projected survival score. Scores were generated by an independent investigator and compared with those calculated by local units. Scores and demographics of listed and not-listed patients were also compared.RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-five of 420 (77%) patients assessed were accepted onto the New Zealand transplant list. Mean estimated five-year survival in listed patients was 89.4% compared to 79.8% in those not accepted (p<0.0001). Listed patients were younger and less likely to have coronary artery disease (CAD). There was no significant difference in scores calculated by the independent assessor and referring centres (p=0.185).CONCLUSION: The algorithm is universally and accurately used. Future studies are required to determine the validity of the system in New Zealand patients. labels: #Algorithms#Cadaver#Eligibility Determination#Female#Humans#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Kidney Transplantation#Male#Medical Audit#Middle Aged#New Zealand#Risk Assessment#Tissue Donors'
b'AIMS: New Zealand has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence in the world. We investigated the gene expression profiles of breast tumours from New Zealand patients, compared them to gene expression profiles of international breast cancer cohorts and identified any associations between altered gene expression and the clinicopathological features of the tumours.METHODS: Affymetrix microarrays were used to measure the gene expression profiles of 106 breast tumours from New Zealand patients. Gene expression data from six international breast cancer cohorts were collated, and all the gene expression data were analysed using standard bioinformatic and statistical tools.RESULTS: Gene expression profiles associated with tumour ER and ERBB2 status, molecular subtype and selected gene expression signatures within the New Zealand cohort were consistent with those found in international cohorts. Significant differences in clinicopathological features such as tumour grade, tumour size and lymph node status were also observed between the New Zealand and international cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiles, which are a sensitive indicator of tumour biology, showed no clear difference between breast tumours from New Zealand patients and those from non-New Zealand patients. This suggests that other factors may contribute to the high and increasing breast cancer incidence in New Zealand compared to international populations. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Breast Neoplasms#Female#Gene Expression#Gene Expression Profiling#Humans#Incidence#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Metastasis#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Grading#New Zealand#RNA, Messenger#Receptors, Estrogen#Tissue Array Analysis'
b'AIMS: To determine whether or not cardiomegaly identified on chest radiograph (CXR) is indicative of true cardiomegaly as determined using echocardiography (echo) as the gold standard tool, and therefore whether or not cardiomegaly on CXR should be investigated further.METHODS: CXR and echocardiogram reports were reviewed for the presence of cardiomegaly in a population following non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Data was evaluated to determine whether cardiomegaly reported on CXR did indeed represent true cardiomegaly. Exploratory analysis was undertaken to determine whether or not Body Surface Area (BSA) was a significant explanatory variable.RESULTS: Data was collected for 244 patients. Thirty-nine were reported to have cardiomegaly on CXR, 22 of those also had cardiomegaly on echo, giving a true positive rate of 56% and a false positive rate of 44%. Fifty-five were reported to have cardiomegaly on echo, of which 33 (60%) did not have cardiomegaly identified on CXR. Sensitivity of CXR to identify cardiomegaly was 40% and specificity was 91% with a positive predictive value of 56% and negative predictive value of 84%. BSA does not appear to be a significant explanatory variable for the discrepancy between the CXR and echo estimates of cardiomegaly.CONCLUSIONS: In patients following an NSTEMI, the true positive rate of cardiomegaly identified on CXR is not too dissimilar to the false positive rate, thereby suggesting that reporting "cardiomegaly" based on CXR findings is inaccurate and rather reporting should simply focus on the cardiothoracic ratio and defining this as an enlarged cardiac silhouette rather than true cardiomegaly. In clinical practice the data indicates that the number needed to investigate to identify true cardiomegaly on echo is only two, thereby concluding that all patients post-NSTEMI with cardiomegaly on CXR should go on to have an echo, consistent with current national guidelines. As the study population were all post-MI, further study is necessary to evaluate whether this association holds true in a wider population. labels: #Aged#Cardiomegaly#Cross-Sectional Studies#Echocardiography#Female#Humans#Male#Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction#Radiography, Thoracic'
b'Demand for health data for secondary research is increasing, both in New Zealand and worldwide. The New Zealand government has established a large research database, the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI), which facilitates research, and an independent ministerial advisory group, the Data Futures Partnership (DFP), to engage with citizens, the private sector and non-government organisations (NGOs) to facilitate trusted data use and strengthen the data ecosystem in New Zealand. We commend these steps but argue that key strategies for effective health-data governance remain absent in New Zealand. In particular, we argue in favour of the establishment of: (1) a specialist Health and Disability Ethics Committee (HDEC) to review applications for secondary-use data research; (2) a public registry of approved secondary-use research projects (similar to a clinical trials registry); and (3) detailed guidelines for the review and approval of secondary-use data research. We present an ethical framework based on the values of public interest, trust and transparency to justify these innovations. labels: #Biomedical Research#Datasets as Topic#Ethics Committees#Guidelines as Topic#Humans#New Zealand#Registries'
b'Background: Nontraumatic knee pain (NTKP) is highly prevalent in adults 65 years of age and older. Evidence-based guidelines recommend early use of rehabilitation; however, there is limited information comparing differences in health care utilization when rehabilitation is included in the management of NTKP.Objectives: To describe the overall health care utilization associated with the management of NTKP; estimate the proportion of people who receive outpatient rehabilitation services; and evaluate the timing of outpatient rehabilitation and its association with other health care utilization.Design: Rretrospective cohort study was conducted using a random 10% sample of 2009-2010 Medicare claims. The sample included 52,504 beneficiaries presenting within the ambulatory setting for management of NTKP.Methods: Exposure to outpatient rehabilitative services following the NTKP index ambulatory visit was defined as 1) no rehabilitation; 2) early rehabilitation (1-15 days); 3) intermediate rehabilitation (16-120 days); and 4) late rehabilitation (>120 days). Logistic regression models were fit to analyze the association of rehabilitation timing with narcotic analgesic use, utilization of nonsurgical invasive procedure, and knee surgery during a 12-month follow-up period.Results: Only 11.1% of beneficiaries were exposed to outpatient rehabilitation services. The likelihood of using narcotics, nonsurgical invasive procedures, or surgery was significantly less (adjusted odds ratios; 0.67, 0.50, 0.58, respectively) for those who received early rehabilitation when compared to no rehabilitation. The exposure-outcome relationships were reversed in the intermediate and late rehabilitation cohorts.Limitations: This was an observational study, and residual confounding could affect the observed relationships. Therefore, definitive conclusions regarding the causal effect of rehabilitation exposure and reduced utilization of more aggressive interventions cannot be determined at this time.Conclusions: Early referral for outpatient rehabilitation may reduce the utilization of health services that carry greater risks or costs in those with NTKP. labels: #Aged#Ambulatory Care#Female#Humans#Knee Injuries#Male#Medicare#Pain#Retrospective Studies#United States'
b'Sleep disturbance is a common problem following concussion. A retrospective chart review was conducted at a regional concussion clinic on patients 13 to 18 years of age between 2005 and 2011. Statistical analysis evaluated sleep disturbance and duration of concussion, as well as the use and effectiveness of melatonin. A total of 417 patients met inclusion criteria. One hundred twenty-three (34%) reported disturbance in sleep. There was no difference in sleep disturbance based on age, gender, or past number of concussions. Sleep disturbance was associated with a 3- to 4-fold increase in recovery time. Non-sport-related concussions were more likely to be associated with sleep disturbance compared to sport-related concussions (45% vs 29%, P = .01). Melatonin improved sleep disturbance in 67% of the patients. Evaluating sleep disorders following concussion is an important part of the assessment. These findings will help clinicians provide anticipatory guidance and treatment for adolescents recovering from concussion. labels: #Adolescent#Brain Concussion#Central Nervous System Depressants#Female#Humans#Male#Melatonin#Recovery of Function#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sleep Wake Disorders#Time#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural hearing loss, and renal disease (HDR) syndrome, also known as Barakat syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder with high phenotypic heterogeneity caused by haploinsufficiency of the GATA3 gene on chromosome 10p14-p15. For these reasons, the diagnosis of HDR syndrome is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion as well as genetic analysis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-month-old boy, with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, showed typical radiological features of X-linked stapes gusher on preoperative temporal bone computed tomography (CT) for cochlear implantations. Then after his discharge from hospital, he suffered a hypocalcemic seizure and we discovered a renal cyst during investigation of hypocalcemia. He was finally diagnosed with HDR syndrome by clinical findings, which were confirmed by molecular genetic testing. Direct sequencing of the GATA3 gene showed a heterozygous 2-bp deletion (c.1201_1202delAT), which is predicted to cause a frameshift of the reading frame (p.Met401Valfs*106).CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of HDR syndrome with a novel de novo variant mimicking a congenital X-linked stapes gusher syndrome. Novel mutations and the diversity of clinical manifestations expand the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of HDR syndrome. Diagnosis of HDR syndrome is still challenging, but clinicians should consider it in their differential diagnosis for children with a wide range of clinical manifestations including hypocalcemia induced seizures and deafness. We hope that this case will contribute to further understanding and studies of HDR-associated GATA3 mutations. labels: #Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10#Cochlear Implantation#Diagnosis, Differential#Frameshift Mutation#GATA3 Transcription Factor#Gene Expression#Genetic Diseases, X-Linked#Haploinsufficiency#Hearing Loss, Conductive#Hearing Loss, Sensorineural#Heterozygote#Humans#Hypoparathyroidism#Infant#Male#Nephrosis#Tomography, X-Ray Computed'
b'BACKGROUND: Subjects undergoing coronary stenting with complex lesion anatomy may experience different risks and benefits with prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy.OBJECTIVES: The authors assessed the effect of 30\xc2\xa0months versus 12\xc2\xa0months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) based on the presence or absence of anatomically-complex target lesions.METHODS: In the DAPT Study, combined myocardial infarction (MI) or stent thrombosis and moderate/severe bleeding were assessed in enrolled (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa025,416) and randomized (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa011,554) subjects. Complex lesions had any of the following characteristics: unprotected left main,>2 lesions/vessel, length\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa530\xc2\xa0mm, bifurcation with side branch\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa52.5\xc2\xa0mm, vein bypass graft, or thrombus-containing lesion. Events were evaluated according to increasing number of complexity characteristics and compared according to DAPT score.RESULTS: Enrolled subjects with more complex target lesions had higher rates of MI or stent thrombosis in the first 12\xc2\xa0months after PCI (3.9% vs. 2.4%; p\xc2\xa0<0.001). Among those who were event-free at 12\xc2\xa0months, rates of MI or stent thrombosis between 12 and 30\xc2\xa0months were similar between those with versus without complex anatomy (3.5% vs. 2.9%; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.07). Reduction of MI or stent thrombosis with continued thienopyridine beyond 12\xc2\xa0months versus placebo was similar for subjects with (2.5% vs. 4.5%; hazard ratio: 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.79; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.001) and without (2.0% vs. 3.8%; hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 0.69; p\xc2\xa0<0.001) anatomic complexity (pinteraction\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.81), as was increase in moderate/severe bleeding (pinteraction\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.44). Among subjects with anatomic complexity, those with DAPT scores\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa52 randomized to continued thienopyridine had greater reductions in MI or stent thrombosis (3.0% vs. 6.1%; p\xc2\xa0<0.001) compared with subjects with scores\xc2\xa0<2 (1.7% vs. 2.3%; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.42; p value comparing risk differences\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.03).CONCLUSIONS: Complex target-lesion anatomy is associated with increased ischemic events, particularly within the first year after PCI. Among those without events in the first 12\xc2\xa0months, the benefits of extending DAPT were similar in subjects with and without complex lesions. A high DAPT score identified those experiencing the most benefit from extended treatment among patients with and without complex anatomy.

b'BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on the association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) levels and outcomes in patients with chest pain but no myocardial infarction (MI), or any other condition that may lead to acutely elevated troponin levels.OBJECTIVES: The authors hypothesized that any detectable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) level is associated with adverse outcomes.METHODS: All patients (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa022,589)>25 years of age with chest pain and hs-cTnT analyzed concurrently in the\xc2\xa0emergency department of Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden from 2011 to 2014 were eligible for inclusion. After excluding all patients with acute conditions that may have affected hs-cTnT, or MI associated with the\xc2\xa0visit, or insufficient information to determine whether troponin levels were stable, Cox regression was used to estimate risks for all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality, MI, and heart failure at different levels of troponins.RESULTS: A total of 19,460 patients with a mean age of 54 \xc2\xb1 17 years were included. During a mean follow-up of 3.3\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa01.2 years, 1,349 (6.9%) patients died. Adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality were 2.00 (1.66 to 2.42), 2.92 (2.38 to 3.59), 4.07 (3.28 to 5.05), 6.77 (5.22 to 8.78), and 9.68 (7.18 to 13.00) in patients\xc2\xa0with hs-cTnT levels of 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 29, 30 to 49, and\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa550\xc2\xa0ng/l, respectively, compared with patients with hs-cTnT levels\xc2\xa0<5\xc2\xa0ng/l. There was a strong and graded association between all detectable levels of hs-cTnT and risk\xc2\xa0for MI, heart failure, and cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with chest pain and stable troponin levels, any detectable level of hs-cTnT is associated with an increased risk of death and cardiovascular outcomes and should merit further attention. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Biomarkers#Cardiovascular Diseases#Chest Pain#Cohort Studies#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Mortality#Sweden#Treatment Outcome#Troponin T#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), cardiac mortality and morbidity were common in HIV-infected children.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify long-term cardiovascular effects of HAART in HIV-infected children.METHODS: The CHAART-2 (HAART-Associated Cardiotoxicity in HIV-Infected Children) study prospectively compared 148 echocardiograms from 74 HAART-exposed children to 860 echocardiograms from 140 HAART-unexposed but HIV-infected children from the Pulmonary and Cardiac Complications of Vertically Transmitted HIV Infection (P2C2HIV) study. Both studies used similar protocol, centralized echocardiographic interpretation, and measures expressed as z-scores referenced to healthy controls. Associations between HAART exposure and echocardiographic measures were\xc2\xa0evaluated using generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: Comparing the HAART-exposed and HAART-unexposed groups, any HAART exposure was positively associated with left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening (z-score for difference\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.07; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.02) and HAART exposure duration (z-score difference per year\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.17; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.003. LV mass was negatively associated with any HAART exposure\xc2\xa0(z-score difference =\xc2\xa0-0.64; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.01) as was septal thickness (z-score difference =\xc2\xa0-0.93; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.001). Duration of HAART exposure was negatively associated with LV end-systolic dimension and heart rate (z-score difference per year=\xc2\xa0-0.11; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.05; and z-score difference per year =\xc2\xa0-0.10; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.002, respectively). During 11 years of follow-up, in the HAART-exposed group, LV mass and LV end-diastolic septal thickness were lower whereas LV contractility and LV\xc2\xa0fractional shortening were higher when compared to the HAART-unexposed group.CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac structure and function were better in perinatally HIV-infected children exposed to HAART than\xc2\xa0in those of similar children from the pre-HAART era but did decline over time. Evidence-based strategies for cardiovascular monitoring are needed to inform treatment decisions to improve long-term cardiovascular health. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active#Cardiotoxins#Child#Child, Preschool#Cohort Studies#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#Humans#Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Perinatal Care#Pregnancy#Prospective Studies#Single-Blind Method#Ventricular Dysfunction, Left'
b'BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has long served as the standard of care for short-term mechanical circulatory support in pediatrics. It is unknown whether newer-generation temporary circulatory support (TCS) devices afford children a meaningful survival advantage over ECMO.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether bridge-to-heart transplant survival with a TCS device is superior to ECMO after adjusting for patient differences.METHODS: All children\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa421 years of age listed for heart transplant from 2011 to 2015 who received a TCS device or\xc2\xa0ECMO as a bridge to transplant were identified using Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data. Children supported with a TCS device were compared with a propensity score (PS)-matched cohort of children\xc2\xa0supported with ECMO as a bridge to transplant. The primary endpoint was Kaplan-Meier survival to transplant.RESULTS: The number of TCS devices implanted in children increased from\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa43 per year before 2011 to 50 in 2015. Overall, 93 patients implanted with TCS devices were included for analysis (59% left ventricular assist devices, 23% right ventricular assist devices, 18% biventricular assist devices). The most commonly used device was the CentriMag-PediMag system (65%), followed by TandemHeart (18%), Rotaflow (6%), and Impella (5%). Among 164 PS-matched patients, support duration was longer for the TCS cohort (median 19\xc2\xa0days vs. 6\xc2\xa0days; p\xc2\xa0<0.001), and was longest for the CentriMag-PediMag (24\xc2\xa0days vs. 6\xc2\xa0days; p\xc2\xa0<0.001) with 27% supported for>60\xc2\xa0days. Compared with the ECMO cohort, the PS-matched TCS cohort had longer survival to transplant (hazard ratio: 0.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.30 to 0.79) and longer overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.61; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 0.96), with 90-day mortality before transplant that was modestly reduced (from 45% with\xc2\xa0ECMO to 39% with TCS).CONCLUSIONS: The use of TCS devices in children as a bridge to transplant has risen rapidly in recent years, led\xc2\xa0by\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0growth of magnetically levitated centrifugal flow pumps. Compared with conventional ECMO, TCS durations\xc2\xa0are\xc2\xa0longer, and more importantly, patient survival is superior. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Child, Preschool#Cohort Studies#Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation#Female#Heart Transplantation#Humans#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Male#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors#United States#Waiting Lists'
b'BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) due to titin truncation (TTNtv) may help guide patient stratification.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish relationships among TTNtv genotype, cardiac phenotype, and outcomes in DCM.METHODS: In this prospective, observational cohort study, DCM patients underwent clinical evaluation, late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance, TTN sequencing, and adjudicated follow-up blinded to genotype for the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, and major arrhythmic and major heart failure events.RESULTS: Of 716 subjects recruited (mean age 53.5 \xc2\xb1 14.3 years; 469 men [65.5%]; 577 [80.6%]New York Heart Association function class I/II), 83 (11.6%) had TTNtv. Patients with TTNtv were younger at enrollment (49.0 years vs. 54.1 years; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.002) and had lower indexed left ventricular mass (5.1 g/m2reduction; padjusted\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.03) compared with patients without TTNtv. There was no difference in biventricular ejection fraction between TTNtv+/-groups. Overall, 78 of 604 patients (12.9%) met the primary endpoint (median follow-up 3.9 years; interquartile range: 2.0 to 5.8 years), including 9 of 71 patients with TTNtv (12.7%) and 69 of 533 (12.9%) without. There was no difference in the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, heart failure, or arrhythmic events, for patients with or without TTNtv (hazard\xc2\xa0ratio adjusted for primary endpoint: 0.92 [95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 1.87]; p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.82).CONCLUSIONS: In this large, prospective, genotype-phenotype study of ambulatory DCM patients, we show that prognostic factors for all-cause DCM also predict outcome in TTNtv DCM, and that TTNtv DCM does not appear to be associated with worse medium-term prognosis. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Cardiomyopathy, Dilated#Child#Cohort Studies#Connectin#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Phenotype#Prospective Studies#Single-Blind Method#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'Treatments for high-risk essential thrombocythemia (ET) address thrombocytosis, disease-related symptoms, as well as risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage, transformation to myelofibrosis, and leukemia. Patients resistant/intolerant to hydroxycarbamide (HC) have a poor outlook. MAJIC (ISRCTN61925716) is a randomized phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) vs best available therapy (BAT) in ET and polycythemia vera patients resistant or intolerant to HC. Here, findings of MAJIC-ET are reported, where the modified intention-to-treat population included 58 and 52 patients randomized to receive ruxolitinib or BAT, respectively. There was no evidence of improvement in complete response within 1 year reported in 27 (46.6%) patients treated with ruxolitinib vs 23 (44.2%) with BAT (P= .40). At 2 years, rates of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation were not significantly different; however, some disease-related symptoms improved in patients receiving ruxolitinib relative to BAT. Molecular responses were uncommon; there were 2 complete molecular responses (CMR) and 1 partial molecular response inCALR-positive ruxolitinib-treated patients. Transformation to myelofibrosis occurred in 1 CMR patient, presumably because of the emergence of a different clone, raising questions about the relevance of CMR in ET patients. Grade 3 and 4 anemia occurred in 19% and 0% of ruxolitinib vs 0% (both grades) in the BAT arm, and grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia in 5.2% and 1.7% of ruxolitinib vs 0% (both grades) of BAT-treated patients. Rates of discontinuation or treatment switching did not differ between the 2 trial arms. The MAJIC-ET trial suggests that ruxolitinib is not superior to current second-line treatments for ET.

b"BACKGROUND: Poor and minority children with injuries concerning for abuse are evaluated and diagnosed for abuse differentially. We hypothesized that 2 steps in the decision-making process would influence evaluation and diagnosis: social intuition from meeting the family and objective social information associated with child abuse risk.METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, 32 child abuse pediatricians (CAPs) submitted 730 child abuse consultations including original medical evaluations and diagnoses. CAPs evaluated and diagnosed each other's cases. Comparisons of evaluations and diagnoses were made by levels of social understanding available to the CAP: meeting the family (social intuition and information), reading the case (social information), and reading the case without social information. Evaluations were compared with a consensus gold standard by using logistic regression modeling adjusting for child and CAP characteristics. Diagnostic categories were compared by level of social understanding and diagnostic certainty by using contingency tables.RESULTS: CAPs without access to social intuition were approximately twice as likely to perform gold standard evaluations for neurotrauma and long bone fracture compared with CAPs who met families. Diagnostic agreement fell from 73.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 70.1%-76.5%) when social information was present to 66.5% (95% CI: 63.1%-70.0%) when social information was restricted. In cases with less certainty, agreement dropped to 51.3% (95% CI: 46.0%-56.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Social intuition and information play a role in the physical child abuse decision-making process, which may contribute to differential diagnosis. Simple interventions including decision tools, check lists, and peer review may structure evaluations to ensure children's equal treatment. labels: #Child#Child Abuse#Diagnosis, Differential#Female#Humans#Interpersonal Relations#Intuition#Male#Pediatricians#Physician-Patient Relations#Poverty#Referral and Consultation#Risk Factors"
b"Objective\xc2\xa0To determine physician characteristics associated with exnovation (scaling back on use) and de-adoption (abandoning use) of carotid revascularization.Design\xc2\xa0Retrospective longitudinal cohort study.Setting\xc2\xa0Medicare claims linked to the Doximity database provider registry, 2006-13.Participants\xc2\xa09158 physicians who performed carotid revascularization on Medicare patients between 2006 and 2013.Main outcome measures\xc2\xa0The primary outcomes were the number of carotid revascularization procedures for each physician per year at the end of the sample period, and the percentage change in the volume of carotid revascularization procedures.Results\xc2\xa0At baseline (2006-07), 9158 physicians performed carotid revascularization. By 2012-13 the use of revascularization in this cohort had declined by 37.7%, with two thirds attributable to scaling back (exnovation) rather than dropping the procedure entirely (de-adoption). Compared with physicians with fewer than 12 years of experience, those with more than 25 years of experience decreased use by an additional 23.0% (95% confidence interval -36.7% to -9.2%). The lowest rates of decline occurred in physicians specializing in vascular or thoracic surgery, for whom the procedures accounted for a large share of revenue. Physicians with high proportions of patients aged more than 80 years or with asymptomatic carotid stenosis were less likely to reduce their use of carotid revascularization.Conclusion\xc2\xa0Surgeons with more experience and the lowest share in carotid revascularization practice reduced their use of the procedure the most. These practice factors should be considered in quality improvement efforts when the evidence base evolves away from a specific treatment. labels: #Carotid Stenosis#Diffusion of Innovation#Endarterectomy, Carotid#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Medicare#Practice Patterns, Physicians'#Retrospective Studies#United States"

Percentages of editors receiving payments and the magnitude of such payments were compared across journals and by specialty. Journal websites were also reviewed to determine if conflict of interest policies for editors were readily accessible.Results\xc2\xa0Of 713 eligible editors, 361 (50.6%) received some (>$0) general payments in 2014, and 139 (19.5%) received research payments. The median general payment was $11 (\xc2\xa38; \xe2\x82\xac9) (interquartile range $0-2923) and the median research payment was $0 ($0-0). The mean general payment was $28\xe2\x80\x89136 (SD $415\xe2\x80\x89045), and the mean research payment was $37\xe2\x80\x89963 (SD $175\xe2\x80\x89239). The highest median general payments were received by journal editors from endocrinology ($7207, $0-85\xe2\x80\x89816), cardiology ($2664, $0-12\xe2\x80\x89912), gastroenterology ($696, $0-20\xe2\x80\x89002), rheumatology ($515, $0-14\xe2\x80\x89280), and urology ($480, $90-669). For high impact general medicine journals, median payments were $0 ($0-14). A review of the 52 journal websites revealed that editor conflict of interest policies were readily accessible (ie, within five minutes) for 17/52 (32.7%) of journals.Conclusions\xc2\xa0Industry payments to journal editors are common and often large, particularly for certain subspecialties. Journals should consider the potential impact of such payments on public trust in published research. labels: #Biomedical Research#Conflict of Interest#Drug Industry#Editorial Policies#Equipment and Supplies#Humans#Income#Manufacturing Industry#Periodicals as Topic#Retrospective Studies#United States"

b'We presented adaptive random network models to describe human behavioral change during epidemics and performed stochastic simulations of SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) epidemic models on adaptive random networks. The interplay between infectious disease dynamics and network adaptation dynamics was investigated in regard to the disease transmission and the cumulative number of infection cases. We found that the cumulative case was reduced and associated with an increasing network adaptation probability but was increased with an increasing disease transmission probability. It was found that the topological changes of the adaptive random networks were able to reduce the cumulative number of infections and also to delay the epidemic peak. Our results also suggest the existence of a critical value for the ratio of disease transmission and adaptation probabilities below which the epidemic cannot occur. labels: #Communicable Diseases, Emerging#Computational Biology#Computer Simulation#Epidemics#Humans#Mathematical Concepts#Models, Biological#Prevalence#Stochastic Processes#Time Factors'
b'Purpose: To refine the Minnesota Grading System (MGS) using definitions from the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS) into a nine-step grading scale (MGS-9).Methods: A nine-step grading scale descriptive analysis using three key phenotypic features (total drusen area, increased, and decreased pigmentation) of human eyebank eyes that were graded according to definitions from the AREDS criteria in order to harmonize studies of disease progression for research involving human tissue. From 2005 through February 2017, we have analyzed 1159 human eyes, procured from two eyebanks. Each macula was imaged using high-resolution, stereoscopic color fundus photography with both direct- and transillumination. Fundus images were digitally overlaid with a grading template and triangulated for foveal centration.Results: We documented and stratified risk for each globe by applying the AREDS nine-step grading scale to the key clinical features from the MGS-9. We found a good distribution within the MGS categories (1-9) with few level eight globes. Eyes were processed within 12.1 \xc2\xb1 6.3, hours from the time of death through imaging, dissection, and freezing or fixation. Applying the MGS-9 to 331 pairs (662 eyes were simultaneously graded), 84% were within one-grading step and 93% within two steps of the fellow eye. We also document reticular pseudodrusen, basal laminar drusen, and pattern dystrophy.Conclusions: The MGS nine-step grading scale enables researchers using human tissue to refine the risk assessment of donor tissue. This analysis will harmonize results among researchers when grading human tissue using MGS criteria. Most importantly, the MGS-9 links directly to the known risk for progression from the AREDS. labels: #Aftercare#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological#Eye Banks#Female#Humans#Macula Lutea#Male#Middle Aged#Minnesota#Reproducibility of Results#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Tissue Donors#Wet Macular Degeneration'
b'Purpose: We determined the effects of a remodeled inner retina on the flicker electroretinograms (ERGs) in a rabbit eye at an advanced stage of inherited retinal degeneration.Methods: Six wild-type (WT) and four rhodopsin P347L transgenic (Tg) rabbits were studied at 18 months of age. Flicker ERGs were elicited by sinusoidal stimuli at frequencies of 3.906 to 50.781 Hz. To block the ON and OFF retinal pathways, 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB), and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3(1H, 4H)-dione (CNQX), respectively, were injected intravitreally. The amplitudes and phases of the fundamental components of the pre- and postdrug ERGs were analyzed. The postsynaptic APB (ON-) and CNQX (OFF-) sensitive components were determined by examining the phases and amplitude vectors.Results: The temporal properties of the Tg rabbits were different from those of the WT rabbits and had unique features; at 3.906 Hz, the amplitude was depressed but it increased by more than 3.5-fold at 15.625 Hz. The reduction of the amplitude at 3.906 Hz in Tg rabbits was caused by a cancelation of the ON and OFF components by a phase difference of 180\xc2\xb0. On the other hand, an increase in the amplitude at 15.625 Hz in Tg rabbits was caused by the summation of the ON and OFF components, which had an approximate 120\xc2\xb0 phase difference.Conclusions: The temporal properties of the flicker ERGs of Tg rabbits were affected markedly by the remodeling of the retinal neurons. Evaluations of the flicker ERGs in RP eyes must be done with careful considerations of the current findings. labels: #Animals#Animals, Genetically Modified#Disease Models, Animal#Electroretinography#Photic Stimulation#Rabbits#Retina#Retinal Neurons#Retinitis Pigmentosa'
b'Purpose: To investigate the relationship between objective ocular torsion and the presence or absence of the trochlear nerve in subjects with unilateral superior oblique palsy (SOP).Methods: A total of 159 subjects with congenital and acquired unilateral SOP were reviewed. Eighty-four subjects who had a normal trochlear nerve (present group) and 75 subjects without a trochlear nerve (absent group) were included. Cyclovertical motility parameters and objective ocular torsion were compared between groups, and factors related to ocular torsion were evaluated.Results: The degree of "net" excyclotorsion in the paretic eye was larger in the absent group compared to the present group (P = 0.002). The proportion of net excyclotorsion in the paretic eye was greater in the absent group (11% vs. 37%), while net incyclotorsion was greater in the present group (41% vs. 23%) (P<0.001). Net excyclotorsion of the paretic eye was associated with absence of the trochlear nerve (P<0.001) and smaller size of the paretic SO (P<0.001). Net incyclotorsion of the paretic eye was related with a normal trochlear nerve (P = 0.005), larger size of the paretic SO (P = 0.002), and greater hypertropia during ipsilateral gaze (P = 0.024).Conclusions: The status of the trochlear nerve, paretic SO size, and hypertropia during ipsilateral gaze which reflects the tensile strength of the ipsilateral superior rectus, significantly contribute to ocular torsion in unilateral SOP. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Child#Child, Preschool#Eye Movements#Female#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Middle Aged#Ocular Motility Disorders#Oculomotor Muscles#Retrospective Studies#Trochlear Nerve#Trochlear Nerve Diseases#Young Adult'
b'Purpose: To evaluate the angiogenic properties of corneal derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Co-MSC).Methods: Co-MSCs were extracted from human cadaver, and wild-type (C57BL/6J) and SERPINF1-/- mice corneas. The MSC secretome was collected in a serum-free medium. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation and fibrin gel bead assay (FIBA) sprout formation were used to assess the angiogenic properties of Co-MSC secretome. Complete corneal epithelial debridement was used to induce corneal neovascularization in wild-type mice. Co-MSCs embedded in fibrin gel was applied over the debrided cornea to evaluate the angiogenic effects of Co-MSCs in vivo. Immunoprecipitation was used to remove soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF, SERPINF1 gene) from the Co-MSC secretome.Results: Co-MSC secretome significantly inhibited HUVECs tube and sprout formation. Co-MSCs from different donors consistently contained high levels of antiangiogenic factors including sFLT-1 and PEDF; and low levels of the angiogenic factor VEGF-A. In vivo, application of Co-MSCs to mouse corneas after injury prevented the development of corneal neovascularization. Removing PEDF or sFLT-1 from the secretome significantly diminished the antiangiogenic effects of Co-MSCs. Co-MSCs isolated from SERPINF1-/- mice had significantly reduced antiangiogenic effects compared to SERPINF1+/+ (wild-type) Co-MSCs.Conclusions: These results illustrate the direct antiangiogenic properties of Co-MSCs, the importance of sFLT-1 and PEDF, and their potential clinical application for preventing pathologic corneal neovascularization. labels: #Animals#Blotting, Western#Cadaver#Cells, Cultured#Cornea#Corneal Neovascularization#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Eye Proteins#Flow Cytometry#Humans#Immunoprecipitation#Mesenchymal Stromal Cells#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Nerve Growth Factors#Serpins#Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1'
b'Purpose: To evaluate the effect of acutely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) on the functional and blood flow responses of the rat retina to flicker stimulation.Methods: Brown Norway (n = 15) rats were dark-adapted before ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. IOP was raised acutely in one eye to \xe2\x88\xbc45 mm Hg with a vascular loop. In 11 rats, white light flicker stimulus (10 Hz, 2 seconds duration, 0.80 log scotopic cd\xc2\xb7s/m2) was applied before and during IOP elevation, and 10 minutes after loop removal. Changes in the total retinal blood flow (TRBF) and retinal function induced by the visual stimulus were measured simultaneously with a combined optical coherence tomography (OCT) + electroretinography (ERG) system. Systemic blood pressure was measured in the remaining four rats frequently from 10 to 90 minutes post anesthesia injection.Results: The systemic blood pressure remained at 99 \xc2\xb1 4 mm Hg throughout the measurements (n = 4). Under normal IOP, the TRBF was 5.6 \xc2\xb1 1.9 \xce\xbcL/min, and the average retinal blood vessel size (BVS) in the vicinity of the optic nerve head (ONH) was 44.1 \xc2\xb1 4.5 \xce\xbcm. During IOP elevation, the TRBF was significantly lower (3.8 \xc2\xb1 1.2 \xce\xbcL/min, P<0.01) and the BVS was significantly smaller (35.1 \xc2\xb1 2.6 \xce\xbcm, P<0.01). Both TRBF and BVS returned to baseline within \xe2\x88\xbc10 minutes from removal of the vascular loop. The flicker-induced TRBF change measured under normal IOP (6.0 \xc2\xb1 3.3%) was reduced significantly to 0.1 \xc2\xb1 0.3% (P<0.01) during IOP elevation, and recovered to 5.9 \xc2\xb1 1.7% within 10 minutes after loop removal. During IOP elevation, the magnitude of the ERG second harmonic component (SHC) decreased to 55% of its baseline value (P<0.01) and remained significantly smaller than baseline (P<0.01).Conclusions: Acute IOP elevation to 45 mm Hg caused suppression of the retinal functional and TRBF response to flicker stimulation. labels: #Acute Disease#Animals#Blood Pressure#Dark Adaptation#Disease Models, Animal#Electroretinography#Intraocular Pressure#Male#Ocular Hypertension#Optic Disk#Photic Stimulation#Rats#Rats, Inbred BN#Regional Blood Flow#Retina#Retinal Vessels#Tomography, Optical Coherence'
b'Purpose: Alterations in retinal oxygen metabolism and retinal microcirculation are signs of impending diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, if specific retinal regions are primarily affected is so far unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate if retinal oxygen saturation (SO2) and microvascular hemodynamic parameters follow a distinct regional pattern in patients with diabetes but no DR.Methods: Patients with type II diabetes without clinically apparent DR were imaged as follows: SO2 in peripapillary vessels was assessed with dual-wavelength oximetry. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) scans were acquired with a prototype system using a swept-source laser with an effective 400 kHz A-scan rate and 16\xc2\xb0 field of view. Regional flow indices termed "flux" were calculated for the peripapillary microvasculature. Parafoveal capillary density was evaluated with the commercially available AngioVue OCTA.Results: Twenty-nine eyes of 16 consecutive patients (59 \xc2\xb1 10 years, 6 females) were included in this study. SO2 differed significantly between quadrants (P<0.001), with a decreasing pattern from the upper nasal through the lower nasal, the upper temporal and the lower temporal quadrant in arterioles and venules. In contrast, peripapillary flux followed an increasing trend from nasally to temporally. Peripapillary and parafoveal microvascular hemodynamic parameters demonstrated no significant regional variability as observed for retinal oxygenation.Conclusions: Metabolic imaging identified regional differences in retinal SO2 without an associated topographic variance in microvascular hemodynamics in type II diabetes without DR. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms causing this heterogeneity in metabolic demand. labels: #Capillaries#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Diabetic Retinopathy#Female#Fluorescein Angiography#Fundus Oculi#Hemodynamics#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Oximetry#Oxygen#Oxygen Consumption#Regional Blood Flow#Retina#Retinal Vessels#Tomography, Optical Coherence'
b'Purpose: To identify and quantify the three distinct retinal capillary plexuses and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in healthy subjects according to age using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) with novel projection artifact removal (PAR) software and improved segmentation.Methods: All eyes in this cross-sectional study underwent OCTA imaging using RTVue XR Avanti with novel PAR AngioVue software. OCTA scans were analyzed and the three main parafoveal retinal capillary plexuses were segmented and vessel density and FAZ area were calculated.Results: A total of 152 normal eyes from 95 subjects (39 males, 56 females, mean age 42 \xc2\xb1 25 years) were included. The mean vessel density was 15.48 \xc2\xb1 2.04 mm-1 in the superficial retinal capillary plexus (SCP), 15.28 \xc2\xb1 1.82 mm-1 in the intermediate retinal capillary plexus (ICP), and 16.33 \xc2\xb1 2.32 mm-1 in the deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) for 3 \xc3\x97 3-mm OCTA images. Analysis of 3 \xc3\x97 3-mm scans yielded a mean FAZ area of 0.270 \xc2\xb1 0.101 mm2. The average reduction in vessel density per year of age with 3 \xc3\x97 3-mm OCTA scans was 0.04 mm-1 (0.22%) in the SCP, 0.05 mm-1 (0.27%) in the ICP, and 0.06 mm-1 (0.30%) in the DCP. The average increase in FAZ area per year of age was 0.0015 mm2 (0.72%).Conclusions: Novel PAR software may provide improved visualization of all three major parafoveal retinal capillary plexuses including the ICP. Using this technology, SCP, ICP, and DCP vessel density decreased with increasing age while FAZ area increased with age. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Capillaries#Child#Child, Preschool#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Fluorescein Angiography#Follow-Up Studies#Fovea Centralis#Fundus Oculi#Healthy Volunteers#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Retinal Vessels#Retrospective Studies#Tomography, Optical Coherence#Visual Acuity#Young Adult'
b'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of chronic liver disease. Till date, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for identification and quantification of the wide histological spectra of NAFLD. Histological scorings are very useful and widely applied for the diagnosis and management in clinical trials and follow-up studies of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, in view of scarce published literature, there is a need to evaluate them in large cohort of NAFLD. This study was aimed to evaluate the two histological scoring systems (NAS-CRN, SAF) in the diagnosis of NAFLD and to assess the role of histological characteristics as injury markers in NAFLD. Retrospective histological study of liver biopsies of 1000 patients diagnosed as NAFLD, between 2010 and 2016, was conducted. Histopathologic evaluation and semiquantiative scoring based on NAS-CRN and SAF algorithm and their correlation with serum aminotransferase and fibrosis were performed. Liver biopsies were classified according to the NAS-CRN scoring, as NAS<3 (not NASH) in 72 (7.2%), NAS 3-4 (borderline NASH) in 310 (31%), and NAS \xe2\x89\xa55 (definite NASH) in 618 (61.8%), and SAF classified 117 (11.7%) not NASH and 883 (88.3%) definite NASH. There was excellent concordance for definite NASH and not NASH; however, 88.06% of borderline NASH was classified as NASH by SAF. 76.39% by NAS and 78.63% by SAF algorithm who were diagnosed as not NASH showed the presence of fibrosis; however, higher stages of fibrosis were significantly more prevalent in definite NASH, excluding burnt-out cirrhosis. Serum ALT was significantly associated with increasing stages of fibrosis (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) and the three categories (not NASH, borderline NASH, and definite NASH) when classified as with/without fibrosis (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). Steatosis of higher grades, more ballooned cells, and more foci of Lobular Inflammation were found in significantly higher proportion of patients with NASH (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001), with higher fibrosis stages (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001) and higher serum ALT levels (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). NAFLD classifications based on histological scoring NAS-CRN and SAF algorithm are concordant for the category of definite NASH and not NASH, while borderline NASH shows discrepant interpretation. There was highly significant correlation between the NAS and SAF categories with high grades of histological characteristics, with serum ALT and with higher stages of fibrosis. Exclusion of fibrosis is a limitation with both scores. labels: #Adult#Alanine Transaminase#Algorithms#Biomarkers#Biopsy#Female#Humans#Liver#Liver Cirrhosis#Male#Microscopy#Middle Aged#Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index'

b': In recent years, health care organizations have been moving away from a culture that responds to errors and near misses with "shame and blame" and toward a fair and just culture. Such a culture encourages and rewards people for speaking up about safety-related concerns, thus allowing the information to be used for system improvement. In part 1 of this series, we reported on findings from a study that examined how nursing schools handled student errors and near misses. We found that few nursing schools had a policy or a reporting tool concerning these events; and that when policies did exist, the majority did not reflect the principles of a fair and just culture. This article, part 2 of the series, describes several strategies that nursing schools can use for creating such a culture. labels: #Education, Nursing#Humans#Medical Errors#Near Miss, Healthcare#Nurse\'s Role#Nursing Evaluation Research#Nursing Staff, Hospital#Schools, Nursing#Students, Nursing#United States'

b"Receiving recommended childhood vaccinations on schedule is the best way to prevent the occurrence and spread of vaccine-preventable diseases (1). Vaccination coverage among children aged 19-35 months in the United States exceeds 90% for most recommended vaccines in the early childhood series (2); however, previous studies have found that few children receive all recommended vaccine doses on time (3). The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), using information from the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) and the MDH Office of Vital Records, examined early childhood immunization rates and found that children with at least one foreign-born parent were less likely to be up-to-date on recommended immunizations at ages 2, 6, 18, and 36 months than were children with two U.S.-born parents. Vaccination coverage at age 36 months varied by mother's region of origin, ranging from 77.5% among children born to mothers from Central and South America and the Caribbean to 44.2% among children born to mothers from Somalia. Low vaccination coverage in these communities puts susceptible children and adults at risk for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, as evidenced by the recent measles outbreak in Minnesota (4). Increased outreach to immigrant, migrant, and refugee populations and other populations with low up-to-date vaccination rates might improve timely vaccination in these communities. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Child, Preschool#Disease Outbreaks#Emigrants and Immigrants#Female#Humans#Immunization Schedule#Infant#Male#Measles#Minnesota#Mothers#Parents#Vaccination#Vaccines#Young Adult"
b'State surveillance during the last 10 years reveals a nationwide increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young adults (1). The proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women is also increasing nationally (2). To estimate the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women and the frequency of confirmed HCV infection in their infants, maternal name and date of birth from HCV reports in the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) were linked to Wisconsin Medicaid data for 2011-2015 births. During this period, in the Wisconsin Medicaid population, the proportion of women who had evidence of HCV infection during pregnancy increased 93%, from 1 in 368 pregnancies to 1 in 192. Among 183 infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 34% received recommended HCV testing (3). Mother-to-infant (vertical) transmission was documented in 4% of infants. Improvements in HCV screening practices among pregnant women and infants could enhance identification of infants at risk for vertical transmission of HCV. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Female#Hepacivirus#Hepatitis C#Humans#Infant#Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical#Mass Screening#Medicaid#Middle Aged#Population Surveillance#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Complications, Infectious#Risk Assessment#United States#Viremia#Wisconsin#Young Adult'
b'Cigarette smoking has declined considerably among U.S. adults over several decades (1); however, increases have occurred in the use of noncigarette tobacco products in recent years, and the use of multiple tobacco products has become common among current users of noncigarette tobacco products (2,3). Differences in tobacco use have also been observed across population subgroups, including among working adults (2,4). CDC analyzed National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data for 2014-2016 to describe the most recent prevalence estimates of current (every day or some days) tobacco product use among working U.S. adults by industry and occupation. Among working adults, 22.1% (32.7 million) currently used any form of tobacco; 15.4% used cigarettes, 5.8% used other combustible tobacco (cigars, pipes, water pipes or hookahs, very small cigars, and bidis), 3.0% used smokeless tobacco, and 3.6% used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes); 4.6% (6.9 million) reported current use of two or more tobacco products. By industry, any tobacco use ranged from 11.0% among education services to 34.3% among construction workers; current use of two or more tobacco products was highest among construction workers (7.1%). By occupation, any tobacco use ranged from 9.3% among life, physical, and social science workers to 37.2% among installation, maintenance, and repair workers; current use of two or more tobacco products was highest among installation, maintenance, and repair workers (10.1%). Proven interventions to prevent and reduce tobacco product use, including current use of multiple products, among working adults are important (5,6). Workplace tobacco-control interventions have been especially effective in reducing cigarette smoking prevalence (7). labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Female#Health Surveys#Humans#Industry#Male#Middle Aged#Occupations#Prevalence#Smoking#Tobacco Products#United States#Young Adult'
b'An autoimmune background is suspected for Doberman hepatitis (DH). It is based on the finding of mononuclear cell infiltrates in the liver, strong female bias, association to the homozygous risk factor dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) allele DRB1*00601 and aberrant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on hepatocytes that correlates with the degree of inflammation in the liver. The aim of this study was to search for autoantibodies against liver-related antigens associated with DH. Twenty-five Dobermans with subclinical DH (SDH), 13 that clinically manifest DH (CDH) and 17 healthy controls were studied. Immunoblotting analysis detected specific antibodies in the DH sera. By mass spectrometry the targets were identified as liver-related enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Using ELISA, anti-GAPDH IgG was detected in 36% (9/25) of SDH dogs and 69.2% (9/13) of the CDH dogs compared to healthy controls (0/17) (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0005). Anti-ADH IgG was detected in 72% (18/25) of SDH dogs and 76.9% (10/13) of CDH dogs and only in one (1/17) control (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0005). The finding of novel autoantigens, GAPDH and ADH strengthen the hypothesis that DH is an autoimmune disease of the liver. These findings suggest that DH could be diagnosed by screening for autoantibodies against the defined antigens. labels: #Alcohol Dehydrogenase#Animals#Autoantibodies#Autoantigens#Dogs#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Female#Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate#Hepatitis, Animal#Immunoblotting#Male#Proteome#Proteomics'
b"On April 25, 2017, the Sinoe County Health Team (CHT) notified the Liberia Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia of an unknown illness among 14 persons that resulted in eight deaths in Sinoe County. On April 26, the National Rapid Response Team and epidemiologists from CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) in Liberia were deployed to support the county-led response. Measures were immediately implemented to identify all cases, ascertain the cause of illness, and control the outbreak. Illness was associated with attendance at a funeral event, and laboratory testing confirmed Neisseria meningitidis in biologic specimens from cases. The 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) outbreak in West Africa devastated Liberia's already fragile health system, and it took many months for the country to mount an effective response to control the outbreak. Substantial efforts have been made to strengthen Liberia's health system to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats. The rapid and efficient field response to this outbreak of N. meningitidis resulted in implementation of appropriate steps to prevent a widespread outbreak and reflects improved public health and outbreak response capacity in Liberia. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Capacity Building#Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)#Child#Cluster Analysis#Disease Outbreaks#Female#Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola#Humans#International Cooperation#Liberia#Male#Middle Aged#Neisseria meningitidis#Public Health Practice#United States#World Health Organization#Young Adult"
b'On April 25, 2017, a cluster of unexplained illness and deaths among persons who had attended a funeral during April 21-22 was reported in Sinoe County, Liberia (1). Using a broad initial case definition, 31 cases were identified, including 13 (42%) deaths. Twenty-seven cases were from Sinoe County (1), and two cases each were from Grand Bassa and Monsterrado counties, respectively. On May 5, 2017, initial multipathogen testing of specimens from four fatal cases using the Taqman Array Card (TAC) assay identified Neisseria meningitidis in all specimens. Subsequent testing using direct real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed N. meningitidis in 14 (58%) of 24 patients with available specimens and identified N. meningitidis serogroup C (NmC) in 13 (54%) patients. N. meningitidis was detected in specimens from 11 of the 13 patients who died; no specimens were available from the other two fatal cases. On May 16, 2017, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia and the Ministry of Health of Liberia issued a press release confirming serogroup C meningococcal disease as the cause of this outbreak in Liberia. labels: #Clinical Laboratory Services#Cluster Analysis#Disease Outbreaks#Humans#Liberia#Meningitis, Meningococcal#Neisseria meningitidis, Serogroup C#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Time Factors'
b'The fourth United Nations Millennium Development Goal, adopted in 2000, set a target to reduce child mortality by two thirds by 2015. One indicator of progress toward this target was measles vaccination coverage (1). In 2010, the World Health Assembly (WHA) set three milestones for measles control by 2015: 1) increase routine coverage with the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) among children aged 1 year to \xe2\x89\xa590% at the national level and to \xe2\x89\xa580% in every district; 2) reduce global annual measles incidence to<5 cases per million population; and 3) reduce global measles mortality by 95% from the 2000 estimate (2).* In 2012, WHA endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan,\xe2\x80\xa0with the objective of eliminating measles in four World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2015 and in five regions by 2020. Countries in all six WHO regions have adopted goals for measles elimination by or before 2020. Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographic area for \xe2\x89\xa512 months, in the presence of a high quality surveillance system that meets targets of key performance indicators. This report updates a previous report (3) and describes progress toward global measles control milestones and regional measles elimination goals during 2000-2016. During this period, annual reported measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons, and annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84%, from 550,100 to 89,780; measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths. However, the 2015 milestones have not yet been met; only one WHO region has been verified as having eliminated measles. Improved implementation of elimination strategies by countries and their partners is needed, with focus on increasing vaccination coverage through substantial and sustained additional investments in health systems, strengthening surveillance systems, using surveillance data to drive programmatic actions, securing political commitment, and raising the visibility of measles elimination goals. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Child#Child, Preschool#Disease Eradication#Global Health#Humans#Immunization Programs#Incidence#Infant#Measles#Measles Vaccine#Young Adult'
b'PROBLEM/CONDITION: Receipt of key preventive health services among women and men of reproductive age (i.e., 15-44 years) can help them achieve their desired number and spacing of healthy children and improve their overall health. The 2014 publication Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (QFP) establishes standards for providing a core set of preventive services to promote these goals. These services include contraceptive care for persons seeking to prevent or delay pregnancy, pregnancy testing and counseling, basic infertility services for those seeking to achieve pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease (STD) services, and other preconception care and related preventive health services. QFP describes how to provide these services and recommends using family planning and other primary care visits to screen for and offer the full range of these services. This report presents baseline estimates of the use of these preventive services before the publication of QFP that can be used to monitor progress toward improving the quality of preventive care received by women and men of reproductive age.PERIOD COVERED: 2011-2013.DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: Three surveillance systems were used to document receipt of preventive health services among women and men of reproductive age as recommended in QFP. The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) collects data on factors that influence reproductive health in the United States since 1973, with a focus on fertility, sexual activity, contraceptive use, reproductive health care, family formation, child care, and related topics. NSFG uses a stratified, multistage probability sample to produce nationally representative estimates for the U.S. household population of women and men aged 15-44 years. This report uses data from the 2011-2013 NSFG. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants in the United States. Annual PRAMS data sets are created and used to produce statewide estimates of preconception and perinatal health behaviors and experiences. This report uses PRAMS data for 2011-2012 from 11 states (Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia). The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalized civilians in the United States. NHIS collects data on a broad range of health topics, including the prevalence, distribution, and effects of illness and disability and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. Households are identified through a multistage probability household sampling design, and estimates are produced using weights that account for the sampling design, nonresponse, and poststratification adjustments. This report uses data from the 2013 NHIS for women aged 18-44 years.RESULTS: Many preventive health services recommended in QFP were not received by all women and men of reproductive age. For contraceptive services, including contraceptive counseling and advice, 46.5% of women aged 15-44 years at risk for unintended pregnancy received services in the past year, and 4.5% of men who had vaginal intercourse in the past year received services in that year. For sexually transmitted disease (STD) services, among all women aged 15-24 years who had oral, anal, or vaginal sex with an opposite sex partner in the past year, 37.5% were tested for chlamydia in that year. Among persons aged 15-44 years who were at risk because they were not in a mutually monogamous relationship during the past year, 45.3% of women were tested for chlamydia and 32.5% of men were tested for any STD in that year. For preconception care and related preventive health services, data from selected states indicated that 33.2% of women with a recent live birth (i.e., 2-9 months postpartum) talked with a health care professional about improving their health before their most recent pregnancy; of selected preconception counseling topics, the most frequently discussed was taking vitamins with folic acid before pregnancy (81.2%), followed by achieving a healthy weight before pregnancy (62.9%) and how drinking alcohol (60.3%) or smoking (58.2%) during pregnancy can affect a baby. Nationally, among women aged 18-44 years irrespective of pregnancy status, 80.9% had their blood pressure checked by a health care professional and 31.7% received an influenza vaccine in the past year; 54.5% of those with high blood pressure were tested for diabetes, 44.9% of those with obesity had a health care professional talk with them about their diet, and 55.2% of those who were current smokers had a health professional talk with them about their smoking in the past year. Among all women aged 21-44 years, 81.6% received a Papanicolaou (Pap) test in the past 3 years. Receipt of certain preventive services varied by age and race/ethnicity. Among women with a recent live birth, the percentage of those who talked with a health care professional about improving their health before their most recent pregnancy increased with age (range: 25.9% and 25.2% for women aged \xe2\x89\xa419 and 20-24 years, respectively, to 35.9% and 37.8% for women aged 25-34 and \xe2\x89\xa535 years, respectively). Among women with a recent live birth, the percentage of those who talked with a health care professional about improving their health before their most recent pregnancy was higher for non-Hispanic white (white) (35.2%) compared with non-Hispanic black (black) (30.0%) and Hispanic (26.0%) women. Conversely, across most STD screening services evaluated, testing was highest among black women and men and lowest among their white counterparts. Receipt of many preventive services recommended in QFP increased consistently across categories of family income and continuity of health insurance coverage. Prevalence of service receipt was highest among women in the highest family income category (>400% of federal poverty level [FPL]) and among women with insurance coverage for each of the following: contraceptive services among women at risk for unintended pregnancy; medical services beyond advice to help achieve pregnancy; vaccinations (hepatitis B and human papillomavirus [HPV], ever; tetanus, past 10 years; influenza, past year); discussions with a health care professional about improving health before pregnancy and taking vitamins with folic acid; blood pressure and diabetes screening; discussions with a health care professional in the past year about diet, among those with obesity; discussions with a health care professional in the past year about smoking, among current smokers; Pap tests within the past 3 years; and mammograms within the past 2 years.INTERPRETATION: Before 2014, many women and men of reproductive age were not receiving several of the preventive services recommended for them in QFP. Although differences existed by age and race/ethnicity, across the range of recommended services, receipt was consistently lower among women and men with lower family income and greater instability in health insurance coverage.PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Information in this report on baseline receipt during 2011-2013 of preventive services for women and men of reproductive age can be used to target improvements in the use of recommended services through the development ofresearch priorities, information for decision makers, and public health practice. Health care administrators and practitioners can use the information to identify subpopulations with the greatest need for preventive services and make informed decisions on resource allocation. Public health researchers can use the information to guide research on the determinants of service use and factors that might increase use of preventive services.

b'BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a hepatic manifestation or precursor of metabolic syndrome, may increase nephrolithiasis, a renal manifestation of insulin resistance, but the prospective association between NAFLD and incident nephrolithiasis has not been evaluated. We examined the association of NAFLD with the development of nephrolithiasis in a large cohort of Korean men and women.METHODS: We performed a cohort study of 208,578 Korean adults who underwent a health checkup examination between January 2002 and December 2014 and were followed-up annually or biennially through December 2014. NAFLD was defined as the presence of fatty liver in the absence of excessive alcohol use or other identifiable causes. Fatty liver and nephrolithiasis were determined based on ultrasonographic findings. We used a parametric Cox model to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of nephrolithiasis according to the presence of NAFLD.RESULTS: During 1,054,887.6 person-year of follow-up, 16,442 participants developed nephrolithiasis. After adjusting for age, center, year of screening exam, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, education level, body mass index, history of hypertension and diabetes, HOMA-IR, uric acid and C-reactive protein, male participants with NAFLD had a significantly increased risk of nephrolithiasis than those without NAFLD (adjusted HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.30). However, no association between NAFLD and nephrolithiasis was observed in women (adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.16).CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study of young and middle-aged Koreans, NAFLD was significantly associated with an increased incidence of nephrolithiasis in men but not in women. labels: #Adult#Cohort Studies#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Nephrolithiasis#Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease'
b"Human action recognition using 3D pose data has gained a growing interest in the field of computer robotic interfaces and pattern recognition since the availability of hardware to capture human pose. In this paper, we propose a fast, simple, and powerful method of human action recognition based on human kinematic similarity. The key to this method is that the action descriptor consists of joints position, angular velocity and angular acceleration, which can meet the different individual sizes and eliminate the complex normalization. The angular parameters of joints within a short sliding time window (approximately 5 frames) around the current frame are used to express each pose frame of human action sequence. Moreover, three modified KNN (k-nearest-neighbors algorithm) classifiers are employed in our method: one for achieving the confidence of every frame in the training step, one for estimating the frame label of each descriptor, and one for classifying actions. Additional estimating of the frame's time label makes it possible to address single input frames. This approach can be used on difficult, unsegmented sequences. The proposed method is efficient and can be run in real time. The research shows that many public datasets are irregularly segmented, and a simple method is provided to regularize the datasets. The approach is tested on some challenging datasets such as MSR-Action3D, MSRDailyActivity3D, and UTD-MHAD. The results indicate our method achieves a higher accuracy. labels: #Algorithms#Biomechanical Phenomena#Humans#Pattern Recognition, Automated"
b'BACKGROUND: Asthma is a non-curable but preventable disease, responsible for higher morbidity worldwide. According to recent WHO report, nearly 235 million people are suffering from asthma leading to 383000 deaths in 2015. The burden of asthma morbidity is higher in developed countries and is increasing in developing countries.OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed at studying the change in prevalence rate of asthma, associated risk factors and estimation of morbidity burden and avoidable cases of asthma in India.METHODS: The second round of Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), 2011-12, was used for the study. For the present study, asthma was defines as ever diagnosed with asthma or having cough with short breath. Multiple-logistic regression was used to identify the possible risk factors associated with prevalence of reporting asthma. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were computed to estimate the overall and risk factors specific burden of morbidity due to asthma using the extrapolated population of year 2015 using 2011 census.RESULTS: Overall prevalence rate of asthma increased from 41.9 (per 1000 population) in 2004-05 to 54.9 (per 1000 population) in 2011-12. The prevalence rate of reporting asthma was higher in poorer states compared to richer states, and also varied by sub-geographies, with higher prevalence rate in northern states of the country and lower rates in north-eastern states of the country. The odds of reporting asthma was higher for younger and older ages, individual with fewer years of schooling (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.21-1.64) for individual with zero years of schooling compared to those with 11 or more years of schooling, individual from lower economic status, individual living in household using unclean fuels (OR:1.21; 95% CI: 1.08-1.34) and smokers (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.17-1.55) compared to their counterparts. In the year 2015, the overall morbidity burden of asthma was estimated at nearly 65 million and more than 82 thousand deaths were attributed due to asthma. The burden was highest among individuals living in households using solid fuels (firewood~80%, Kerosene~78%). One-third of the cases could be eliminated by minimising the use of any solid fuels. Around 17% of all the asthma cases in population could be attributed to underweight.CONCLUSION: Eliminating the modifiable risk factors could help reduce in huge amount of asthma cases for example by providing education, cessation in smoking, and schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), by providing clean fuel (LPG) to poor and vulnerable households. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Asthma#Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Humans#India#Logistic Models#Male#Middle Aged#Prevalence#Young Adult'
b'The induction of rapid cell death is an effective strategy for plants to restrict biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens at the infection site. However, activation of cell death comes at a high cost, as dead cells will no longer be available for defense responses nor general metabolic processes. In addition, necrotrophic pathogens that thrive on dead tissue, take advantage of cell death-triggering mechanisms. Mechanisms by which plants solve this conundrum remain described. Here, we identify PLANT SMY2-TYPE ILE-GYF DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1 (PSIG1) and show that PSIG1 helps to restrict cell death induction during pathogen infection. Inactivation of PSIG1 does not result in spontaneous lesions, and enhanced cell death in psig1 mutants is independent of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, PSIG1 interacts with SMG7, which plays a role in nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), and the smg7-4 mutant allele mimics the cell death phenotype of the psig1 mutants. Intriguingly, the psig1 mutants display enhanced susceptibility to the hemi-biotrophic bacterial pathogen. These findings point to the existence and importance of the SA- and ROS-independent cell death constraining mechanism as a part of the plant immune system. labels: #Arabidopsis#Arabidopsis Proteins#Carrier Proteins#Cell Death#Gene Expression Regulation, Plant#Host-Pathogen Interactions#Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay#Plant Diseases#Protein Domains#Reactive Oxygen Species#Salicylic Acid'
b'Host-targeting type IV secretion systems (T4SS) evolved from conjugative T4SS machineries that mediate interbacterial plasmid transfer. However, the origins of effectors secreted by these virulence devices have remained largely elusive. Previous work showed that some effectors exhibit homology to toxins of bacterial toxin-antitoxin modules, but the evolutionary trajectories underlying these ties had not been resolved. We previously reported that FicT toxins of FicTA toxin-antitoxin modules disrupt cellular DNA topology via their enzymatic FIC (filamentation induced by cAMP) domain. Intriguingly, the FIC domain of the FicT toxin VbhT of Bartonella schoenbuchensis is fused to a type IV secretion signal-the BID (Bep intracellular delivery) domain-similar to the Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) that are secreted into eukaryotic host cells via the host-targeting VirB T4SS. In this study, we show that the VbhT toxin is an interbacterial effector protein secreted via the conjugative Vbh T4SS that is closely related to the VirB T4SS and encoded by plasmid pVbh of B. schoenbuchensis. We therefore propose that the Vbh T4SS together with its effector VbhT represent an evolutionary missing link on a path that leads from a regular conjugation system and FicTA toxin-antitoxin modules to the VirB T4SS and the Beps. Intriguingly, phylogenetic analyses revealed that the fusion of FIC and BID domains has probably occurred independently in VbhT and the common ancestor of the Beps, suggesting parallel evolutionary paths. Moreover, several other examples of TA module toxins that are bona fide substrates of conjugative T4SS indicate that their recruitment as interbacterial effectors is prevalent and serves yet unknown biological functions in the context of bacterial conjugation. We propose that the adaptation for interbacterial transfer favors the exaptation of FicT and other TA module toxins as inter-kingdom effectors and may thus constitute an important stepping stone in the evolution of host-targeted effector proteins. labels: #Amino Acid Sequence#Antitoxins#Bacterial Proteins#Bacterial Secretion Systems#Bacterial Toxins#Bartonella#Bartonella Infections#Conjugation, Genetic#Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial#Host-Pathogen Interactions#Plasmids#Sequence Homology#Virulence'
b'BACKGROUND: Lack of surveillance systems and accurate data impede evidence-based decisions on treatment and prevention of enteric fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi/Paratyphi. The WHO coordinates a global Invasive Bacterial-Vaccine Preventable Diseases (IB-VPD) surveillance network but does not monitor enteric fever. We evaluated the feasibility and sustainability of integrating enteric fever surveillance into the ongoing IB-VPD platform.METHODOLOGIES: The IB-VPD surveillance system uses WHO definitions to enroll 2-59 month children hospitalized with possible pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis. We expanded this surveillance system to additionally capture suspect enteric fever cases during 2012-2016, in two WHO sentinel hospitals of Bangladesh, by adding inclusion criteria of fever \xe2\x89\xa5102\xc2\xb0F for \xe2\x89\xa53 days, irrespective of other manifestations. Culture-positive enteric fever cases from in-patient departments (IPD) detected in the hospital laboratories but missed by the expanded surveillance, were also enrolled to assess completion. Costs for this integration were calculated for the additional personnel and resources required.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the IB-VPD surveillance, 5,185 cases were enrolled; 3% (N = 171/5185) were positive for microbiological growth, of which 55% (94/171) were culture-confirmed cases of enteric fever (85 Typhi and 9 Paratyphi A). The added inclusion criteria for enteric fever enrolled an additional 1,699 cases; 22% (358/1699) were positive, of which 85% (349/358) were enteric fever cases (305 Typhi and 44 Paratyphi A). Laboratory surveillance of in-patients of all ages enrolled 311 additional enteric fever cases (263 Typhi and 48 Paratyphi A); 9% (28/311) were 2-59 m and 91% (283/311)>59 m. Altogether, 754 (94+349+311) culture-confirmed enteric fever cases were found, of which 471 were 2-59 m. Of these 471 cases, 94% (443/471) were identified through the hospital surveillances and 6% (28/471) through laboratory results. Twenty-three percent (170/754) of all cases were children<2 years. Additional cost for the integration was USD 44,974/year, a 27% increase to the IB-VPD annual expenditure.CONCLUSION: In a setting where enteric disease is a substantial public health problem, we could integrate enteric fever surveillance into the standard IB-VPD surveillance platform at a modest cost. labels: #Bangladesh#Child, Preschool#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Paratyphoid Fever#Public Health Surveillance#Salmonella paratyphi A#Salmonella typhi#Typhoid Fever#Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines#Vaccination#World Health Organization'
b'Schistosomiasis has been of concern to local health authorities for most of the last century, and in spite of a lack of effective chemotherapy, the disease was dealt with quite effectively in many endemic countries by snail control and environmental management [1]. Much of this work was reported in journals prior to the electronic era but, sadly, seems to have been subsequently ignored. For many years, there followed a global hiatus on schistosomiasis control, and much of the local expertise was lost, but many things have changed more recently, mainly with the advent of generic and affordable praziquantel. With the increased availability of this drug, there has been anincreasing interest in readdressing schistosomes as well as other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The strategic approach for this had been based almost exclusively on chemotherapy. Recently, however, questions arose about this strategy with evidence that chemotherapy alone was not succeeding [2]. Additional strategies were needed, and the "Towards Elimination of Schistosomiasis" (TES) 2017 Conference in Cameroon stressed an integrated PHASE strategy. This was in line with the WHO-NTD and WHO-AFRO 2014-2020 Regional Strategy on NTDs and directed emphasis on transmission control. Subsequently, this emphasis was discussed in a comprehensive review [3]that stressed the importance of such additions to any elimination programme. In reality, this means focusing on the aquatic snail hosts where and when transmission occurs, defining other risk factors such as water contact and latrine design and identifying improved sanitation and health education as essential components for elimination. For schistosomiasis reduction during the mid-20th century, transmission control was used extensively, but these facts are not well reported. Recent reviews have attempted to cover previous research [4,5], but sadly, they have left major knowledge gaps, particularly from Africa. These omissions also occurred in a recent WHO pamphlet on molluscicides [6]. Sadly, search engines used to retrieve information appear to miss much done by 5 African research institutes active from 1950 to 1990. It seems appropriate to take a look back to a time when fieldwork was a focus of research and transmission control was emphasised. labels: #Africa#Animals#Congresses as Topic#Disease Eradication#Disease Vectors#Humans#Molluscacides#Neglected Diseases#Praziquantel#Sanitation#Schistosomiasis#Snails#World Health Organization#Zimbabwe'
b'BACKGROUND: Most studies showing a volume outcome effect in resection surgery for oesophago-gastric cancer were conducted before the centralisation of clinical services. This study evaluated the relation between hospital- and surgeon volume and different risk-adjusted outcomes after oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer surgery in England between 2011 and 2013.METHODS: In data from the National Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Audit from the UK, multivariable random-effects logistic regression models were used to quantify the effect of surgeon and hospital volume on three outcomes: 30-day and 90-day mortality and anastomotic leakage. The models included patient risk factors to adjust for differences in case-mix among hospitals and surgeons. The between-cluster heterogeneity was estimated with the median odds ratio (MOR).RESULTS: The study included patients treated at 42 hospitals and 329 surgeons. The median (interquartile range) of the annual hospital and surgeon volumes were 110 patients (82 to 137) and 13 patients (8 to 19), respectively. The overall rates for 30-day and 90-day mortality were 2.3% and 4.4% respectively, and the anastomotic leakage was 6.3%. Higher hospital volume was associated with lower 30-day mortality (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91-0.98) and lower anastomotic leakage rates (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.98) but not 90-day mortality. Higher surgeon volume was only associated with lower anastomotic leakage rates (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72-0.92). Hospital volume explained a part of the between-hospital variation in 30-day mortality whereas surgeon volume explained part of the between-hospital variation in anastomotic leakage.CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of centralized O-G cancer surgery in England, we could still observe an effect of volume on short-term outcomes. However, the effect is inconsistent, depending on the type of outcome measure under consideration, and much smaller than in previous studies. Efforts to centralise O-G cancer services further should carefully address the effects of both hospital and surgeon volume on the range of outcome measures that are relevant to patients. labels: #Aged#Digestive System Surgical Procedures#Esophageal Neoplasms#Female#Hospitals, High-Volume#Hospitals, Low-Volume#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Stomach Neoplasms'
b"BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are far more prevalent in European Americans than in African Americans. Hypothesizing that this racial disparity in prevalence might represent a genetic susceptibility, we used an admixture mapping approach to interrogate disease association with genomic differences between European and African ancestry.METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples were identified from 54 African Americans with BE or EAC through review of surgical pathology databases at participating Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet) institutions. DNA was extracted from normal tissue, and genotyped on the Illumina OmniQuad SNP chip. Case-only admixture mapping analysis was performed on the data from both all 54 cases and also on a subset of 28 cases with high genotyping quality. Haplotype phases were inferred with Beagle 3.3.2, and local African and European ancestries were inferred with SABER plus. Disease association was tested by estimating and testing excess European ancestry and contrasting it to excess African ancestry.RESULTS: Both datasets, the 54 cases and the 28 cases, identified two admixture regions. An association of excess European ancestry on chromosome 11p reached a 5% genome-wide significance threshold, corresponding to -log10(P) = 4.28. A second peak on chromosome 8q reached -log10(P) = 2.73. The converse analysis examining excess African ancestry found no genetic regions with significant excess African ancestry associated with BE and EAC. On average, the regions on chromosomes 8q and 11p showed excess European ancestry of 15% and 20%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal regions on 11p15 and 8q22-24 are associated with excess European ancestry in African Americans with BE and EAC. Because GWAS have not reported any variants in these two regions, low frequency and/or rare disease associated variants that confer susceptibility to developing BE and EAC may be driving the observed European ancestry association evidence. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#African Americans#Barrett Esophagus#Esophageal Neoplasms#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Humans"
b"Maleic acid (MA), an intermediate reagent used in many industrial products, instigated public health concerns in Taiwan when it was used to adulterate an array of starch-based delicacies to improve texture and storage time. Established studies reported that exposure to high concentrations of MA induce renal injury; little is known whether oxidative stress is induced at a relative low dose. This study aims to investigate the effect of oral single dose exposure of MA on the status of oxidative stress and inflammation. Single dose of MA at 0, 6 and 60 mg/kg (control, low- and high-dose groups, respectively) were orally administered to adult male and female rats. Urine samples were collected and analyzed to measure 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\xce\xb1 (8-IsoPGF2\xce\xb1), 8-nitroguanine (8-NO2Gua) and N-acetyl-S-(tetrahydro-5-hydroxy-2-pentyl-3-furanyl)-L-cysteine (HNE-MA) using LC-MS/MS. Results revealed that oral consumption of MA induced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, as demonstrated by the statistically significant increases in urinary levels of 8-NO2Gua, 8-OHdG, and 8-isoPGF2\xce\xb1, in high-dosed male rats within 12 h of oral gavage (p<0.05). Additionally, increases in concentration of these biomarkers persist for days after consumption; male rats appear to be more sensitive to oxidative burden compared to their counterparts. The aforementioned findings could help elucidate the mechanisms through which nephrotoxicity occur. labels: #Animals#Biomarkers#Body Weight#DNA Damage#Disease Models, Animal#Female#Inflammation#Male#Maleates#Oxidative Stress#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley"
b'Merging paired-end shotgun reads generated on high-throughput sequencing platforms can substantially improve various subsequent bioinformatics processes, including genome assembly, binning, mapping, annotation, and clustering for taxonomic analysis. With the inexorable growth of sequence data volume and CPU core counts, the speed and scalability of read-processing tools becomes ever-more important. The accuracy of shotgun read merging is crucial as well, as errors introduced by incorrect merging percolate through to reduce the quality of downstream analysis. Thus, we designed a new tool to maximize accuracy and minimize processing time, allowing the use of read merging on larger datasets, and in analyses highly sensitive to errors. We present BBMerge, a new merging tool for paired-end shotgun sequence data. We benchmark BBMerge by comparison with eight other widely used merging tools, assessing speed, accuracy and scalability. Evaluations of both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BBMerge produces merged shotgun reads with greater accuracy and at higher speed than any existing merging tool examined. BBMerge also provides the ability to merge non-overlapping shotgun read pairs by using k-mer frequency information to assemble the unsequenced gap between reads, achieving a significantly higher merge rate while maintaining or increasing accuracy. labels: #Algorithms#Computational Biology#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing'
b'INTRODUCTION: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a disease caused by protozoan parasites transmitted by tsetse flies, is an important neglected tropical disease endemic in remote regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Although the determination of the burden of HAT has been based on incidence, mortality and morbidity rates, the true burden of HAT goes beyond these metrics. This study sought to establish the socio-economic burden that households with HAT faced and the coping strategies they employed to deal with the increased burden.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used and data were obtained through: review of hospital records; structured interviews (152); key informant interviews (11); case narratives (12) and focus group discussions (15) with participants drawn from sleeping sickness patients in the south western HAT foci in Kenya. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics while qualitative data was analysed based on emerging themes.RESULTS: Socio-economic impacts included, disruption of daily activities, food insecurity, neglect of homestead, poor academic performance/school drop-outs and death. Delayed diagnosis of HAT caused 93% of the affected households to experience an increase in financial expenditure (ranging from US$ 60-170) in seeking treatment. Out of these, 81.5% experienced difficulties in raising money for treatment resorting to various ways of raising it. The coping strategies employed to deal with the increased financial expenditure included: sale of agricultural produce (64%); seeking assistance from family and friends (54%); sale/lease of family assets (22%); seeking credit (22%) and use of personal savings (17%).CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Coping strategies outlined in this study impacted negatively on the affected households leading to further food insecurity and impoverishment. Calculation of the true burden of disease needs to go beyond incidence, mortality and morbidity rates to capture socio-economic variables entailed in seeking treatment and coping strategies of HAT affected households. labels: #Cost of Illness#Family Characteristics#Food Supply#Health Expenditures#Humans#Interviews as Topic#Kenya#Socioeconomic Factors#Trypanosomiasis, African'
b'BACKGROUND: Yaws is a non-venereal treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. The disease is targeted by WHO for eradication by 2020. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are envisaged for confirmation of clinical cases during treatment campaigns and for certification of the interruption of transmission. Yaws testing requires both treponemal (trep) and non-treponemal (non-trep) assays for diagnosis of current infection. We evaluate a sequential testing strategy (using a treponemal RDT before a trep/non-trep RDT) in terms of cost and cost-effectiveness, relative to a single-assay combined testing strategy (using the trep/non-trep RDT alone), for two use cases: individual diagnosis and community surveillance.METHODS: We use cohort decision analysis to examine the diagnostic and cost outcomes. We estimate cost and cost-effectiveness of the alternative testing strategies at different levels of prevalence of past/current infection and current infection under each use case. We take the perspective of the global yaws eradication programme. We calculate the total number of correct diagnoses for each strategy over a range of plausible prevalences. We employ probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to account for uncertainty and report 95% intervals.RESULTS: At current prices of the treponemal and trep/non-trep RDTs, the sequential strategy is cost-saving for individual diagnosis at prevalence of past/current infection less than 85% (81-90); it is cost-saving for surveillance at less than 100%. The threshold price of the trep/non-trep RDT (below which the sequential strategy would no longer be cost-saving) is US$ 1.08 (1.02-1.14) for individual diagnosis at high prevalence of past/current infection (51%) and US$ 0.54 (0.52-0.56) for community surveillance at low prevalence (15%).DISCUSSION: We find that the sequential strategy is cost-saving for both diagnosis and surveillance in most relevant settings. In the absence of evidence assessing relative performance (sensitivity and specificity), cost-effectiveness is uncertain. However, the conditions under which the combined test only strategy might be more cost-effective than the sequential strategy are limited. A cheaper trep/non-trep RDT is needed, costing no more than US$ 0.50-1.00, depending on the use case. Our results will help enhance the cost-effectiveness of yaws programmes in the 13 countries known to be currently endemic. It will also inform efforts in the much larger group of 71 countries with a history of yaws, many of which will have to undertake surveillance to confirm the interruption of transmission. labels: #Cohort Studies#Cost-Benefit Analysis#Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures#Disease Eradication#Epidemiological Monitoring#Humans#Prevalence#Sensitivity and Specificity#Treponema pallidum#Yaws'
b'The thalamus plays a critical role in the genesis of thalamocortical oscillations, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To understand whether the isolated thalamus can generate multiple distinct oscillations, we developed a biophysical thalamic model to test the hypothesis that generation of and transition between distinct thalamic oscillations can be explained as a function of neuromodulation by acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) and afferent synaptic excitation. Indeed, the model exhibited four distinct thalamic rhythms (delta, sleep spindle, alpha and gamma oscillations) that span the physiological states corresponding to different arousal levels from deep sleep to focused attention. Our simulation results indicate that generation of these distinct thalamic oscillations is a result of both intrinsic oscillatory cellular properties and specific network connectivity patterns. We then systematically varied the ACh/NE and input levels to generate a complete map of the different oscillatory states and their transitions. Lastly, we applied periodic stimulation to the thalamic network and found that entrainment of thalamic oscillations is highly state-dependent. Our results support the hypothesis that ACh/NE modulation and afferent excitation define thalamic oscillatory states and their response to brain stimulation. Our model proposes a broader and more central role of the thalamus in the genesis of multiple distinct thalamo-cortical rhythms than previously assumed. labels: #Acetylcholine#Biological Clocks#Computer Simulation#Deep Brain Stimulation#Feedback, Physiological#Humans#Models, Neurological#Nerve Net#Neurotransmitter Agents#Norepinephrine#Oscillometry#Synaptic Transmission#Thalamus'
b'African lungfishes are ammonotelic in water. They can aestivate for long periods on land during drought. During aestivation, the gills are covered with dried mucus and ammonia excretion ceases. In fishes, ammonia excretion through the gills involves Rhesus glycoproteins (RhGP/Rhgp). This study aimed to obtain the complete cDNA coding sequences of rhgp from the gills of Protopterus annectens, and to determine their branchial mRNA and protein expression levels during the induction, maintenance and arousal phases of aestivation. Three isoforms of rhgp (rhag, rhbg and rhcg) were obtained in the gills of P. annectens. Their complete cDNA coding sequences ranged between 1311 and 1398 bp, coding for 436 to 465 amino acids with estimated molecular masses between 46.8 and 50.9 kDa. Dendrogramic analyses indicated that Rhag was grouped closer to fishes, while Rhbg and Rhcg were grouped closer to tetrapods. During the induction phase, the protein abundance of Rhag, but not its transcript level, was down-regulated in the gills, suggesting that there could be a decrease in the release of ammonia from the erythrocytes to the plasma. Furthermore, the branchial transcript levels of rhbg and rhcg decreased significantly, in preparation for the subsequent shutdown of gill functions. During the maintenance phase, the branchial expression levels of rhag/Rhag, rhbg/Rhbg and rhcg/Rhcg decreased significantly, indicating that their transcription and translation were down-regulated. This could be part of an overall mechanism to shut down branchial functions and save metabolic energy used for transcription and translation. It could also be regarded as an adaptive response to stop ammonia excretion. During the arousal phase, it is essential for the lungfish to regain the ability to excrete ammonia. Indeed, the protein abundance of Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg recovered to the corresponding control levels after 1 day or 3 days of recovery from 6 months of aestivation. labels: #Amino Acid Sequence#Animals#Down-Regulation#Fishes#Gills#Glycoproteins#RNA, Messenger#Sequence Homology, Amino Acid'
b'The pathophysiology and natural history of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are poorly understood. Consequently, our approaches to treatment of POP are limited. Alterations in the extracellular matrix components of pelvic support ligaments and vaginal tissue, including collagen and elastin, have been associated with the development of POP in animals and women. Prior studies have shown the protease MMP-9, a key player of ECM degradation, is upregulated in vaginal tissues from both mice and women with POP. On the other hand, fibulin-5, an elastogenic organizer, has been found to inhibit MMP-9 in the vaginal wall. Hence, we hypothesized that prolonged release of fibulin-5 may delay progression of POP. To test the hypothesis, oligo (ethylene glycol)-based thermosensitive hydrogels were fabricated, characterized and then used to deliver fibulin-5 to the vaginal wall and inhibit MMP-9 activity. The results indicate that hydrogels are cell and tissue compatible. The hydrogels also prolong the \xc2\xbd life of fibulin-5 in cultured vaginal fibroblasts and in the vaginal wall in vivo. Finally, fibulin-5-containing hydrogels resulted in incorporation of fibulin-5 into the vaginal matrix and inhibition of MMP-9 for several weeks after injection. These results support the idea of fibulin-5 releasing hydrogel being developed as a new treatment for POP. labels: #Animals#Female#Hydrogels#Mice#Mice, Knockout#Proteins#Vagina'
b'Cooking oil waste leads to well-known environmental impacts and its bioremediation by lipase-based enzymatic activity can minimize the high cytotoxic potential. In addition, they are among the biocatalysts most commercialized worldwide due to the versatility of reactions and substrates. However, although lipases are able to process cooking oil wastes, the products generated from this process do not necessarily become less toxic. Thus, the aim of the current study is to analyze the bioremediation of lipase-catalyzed cooking oil wastes, as well as their effect on the cytotoxicity of both the oil and its waste before and after enzymatic treatment. Thus, assessed the post-frying modification in soybean oil and in its waste, which was caused by hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by commercial and home-made lipases. The presence of lipases in the extracts obtained from orange wastes was identified by zymography. The profile of the fatty acid esters formed after these reactions was detected and quantified through gas chromatography and fatty acids profile compared through multivariate statistical analyses. Finally, the soybean oil and its waste, with and without enzymatic treatment, were assessed for toxicity in cytotoxicity assays conducted in vitro using fibroblast cell culture. The soybean oil wastes treated with core and frit lipases through transesterification reaction were less toxic than the untreated oils, thus confirming that cooking oil wastes can be bioremediated using orange lipases. labels: #Biodegradation, Environmental#Cooking#Esterification#Lipase#Soybean Oil'
b'OBJECTIVES: To assess whether strain histograms are equal to strain ratios in predicting breast tumour malignancy and to see if either could be used to upgrade Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3 tumours for immediate biopsy.METHODS: Ninety-nine breast tumours were examined using B-mode BI-RADS scorings and strain elastography. Strain histograms and ratios were assessed, and areas- under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUROC) for each method calculated. In BI-RADS 3 tumours cut-offs for strain histogram and ratio values were calculated to see if some tumours could be upgraded for immediate biopsy. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the effect of tumour depth and size, and breast density on strain elastography.RESULTS: Forty-four of 99 (44.4%) tumours were malignant. AUROC of BI-RADS, strain histograms and strain ratios were 0.949, 0.830 and 0.794 respectively. There was no significant difference between AUROCs of strain histograms and strain ratios (P = 0.405), while they were both inferior to BI-RADS scoring (P<0.001, P = 0.008). Four out of 26 BI-RADS 3 tumours were malignant. When cut-offs of 189 for strain histograms and 1.44 for strain ratios were used to upgrade BI-RADS 3 tumours, AUROCS were 0.961 (Strain histograms and BI-RADS) and 0.941 (Strain ratios and BI-RADS). None of them was significantly different from BI-RADS scoring alone (P = 0.249 and P = 0.414). Tumour size and depth, and breast density influenced neither strain histograms (P = 0.196, P = 0.115 and P = 0.321) nor strain ratios (P = 0.411, P = 0.596 and P = 0.321).CONCLUSION: Strain histogram analyses are reliable and easy to do in breast cancer diagnosis and perform comparably to strain ratio analyses. No significant difference in AUROCs between BI-RADS scoring and elastography combined with BI-RADS scoring was found in this study. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged, 80 and over#Breast Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Mammography#Middle Aged#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: The entomopathogenic mushroom Cordyceps militaris is an important medicinal and food resource owing to its various medicinal components and pharmacological effects. However, the high frequency of strain degeneration during subculture seriously restricts the large-scale production of C. militaris, and the mechanism underlying strain degeneration remains unclear. In this study, we artificially cultured C. militaris for six generations and compared changes during fruiting body growth. The transcriptome of six generations of C. militaris strains were sequenced with the Illumine Hiseq4000.RESULTS: The subcultured C. militaris strains degenerated beginning at the third generation, with incomplete fruiting body growth beginning at the fourth generation. Over 9,015 unigenes and 731 new genes were identified. In addition, 35,323 alternative splicing (AS) events were detected in all samples, and more AS events occurred in the second, fourth and sixth generations. Compared with the first generation, the third generation (degenerated strain) included 2,498 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 1,729 up-regulated and 769 down-regulated genes. This number was higher than the number of DEGs in the second (1,892 DEGs), fourth (2,006 DEGs), fifth (2,273 DEGs) and sixth (2,188 DEGs) generations. Validation of RNA-seq by qRT-PCR showed that the expression patterns of 51 DEGs were in accordance with the transcriptome data.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the mechanism of C. militaris strain degeneration is associated with gene involved in toxin biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and DNA methylation and chromosome remodeling. labels: #Cordyceps#Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal#Genes, Fungal#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Transcriptome'
b'Hemogenic endothelium (HE) undergoes endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) to generate blood, a process that requires progressive down-regulation of endothelial genes and induction of hematopoietic ones. Previously, we have shown that the transcription factor HoxA3 prevents blood formation by inhibiting Runx1 expression, maintaining endothelial gene expression and thus blocking EHT. In the present study, we show that HoxA3 also prevents blood formation by inhibiting Notch pathway. HoxA3 induced upregulation of Jag1 ligand in endothelial cells, which led to cis-inhibition of the Notch pathway, rendering the HE nonresponsive to Notch signals. While Notch activation alone was insufficient to promote blood formation in the presence of HoxA3, activation of Notch or downregulation of Jag1 resulted in a loss of the endothelial phenotype which is a prerequisite for EHT. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Notch pathway activation is necessary to downregulate endothelial markers during EHT. labels: #Animals#Down-Regulation#Endothelial Cells#Hematopoiesis#Homeodomain Proteins#Jagged-1 Protein#Mice#Receptors, Notch#Signal Transduction'
b'Asthma is a chronic airway inflammation with a potential systemic impact. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory artery disease. The aim of our study was to prove if there is a correlation between the occurrence of asthma and increased atherosclerotic vessel disorders. Vessel status was compared between mild-to-moderate, severe allergic asthma and matched controls. Measurements of artery stiffness were calculated by central pulse wave velocity, ultrasonographic strain imaging and ankle-brachial index. Atherosclerotic plaque burden was assessed by colour-coded duplex sonography. Additionally, analysis of cardiovascular and asthma blood markers was conducted. Arterial stiffness expressed as an increased central pulse wave velocity and decreased circumferential and radial strains as well as the prevalence of media sclerosis were significantly higher among asthma patients compared to controls. Atherosclerotic plaque burden was relevantly increased in asthma groups vs. controls (severe asthma: 43.1%, mild-to-moderate asthma: 25.0%, control: 14.3% of study participants). Except for the elevated IgE and fibrinogen concentrations as well as leukocyte number there were no relevant differences in the blood parameters between the groups. Allergic asthma is associated with distinct atherosclerotic artery changes compared to the respectively matched control collective. The severity of asthma correlates with more pronounced pathological vessel alternations. labels: #Adult#Arteries#Asthma#Atherosclerosis#Biomarkers#Female#Fibrinogen#Humans#Immunoglobulin E#Leukocyte Count#Male#Middle Aged#Pulse Wave Analysis#Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex'
b'The net form of net blotch caused by the necrotrophic fungus Pyrenophora teres f. teres is a major disease of barley, causing high yield losses and reduced malting and feed quality. Exploiting the allelic richness of wild barley proved to be a valuable tool to broaden the genetic base of resistance of modern elite cultivars. In this study, a SNP-based nested association mapping (NAM) study was conducted to map QTL for P. teres resistance in the barley population HEB-25 comprising 1,420 lines derived from BC1S3 generation. By scoring the percentage of infected leaf area followed by calculation of the average ordinate (AO) and scoring of the reaction type (RT) in two-year field trials a large variability of net blotch resistance across and within families of HEB-25 was observed. Genotype response to net blotch infection showed a range of 48.2% for AO (0.9-49.1%) and 6.4 for RT (2.2-8.6). NAM based on 5,715 informative SNPs resulted in the identification of 24 QTL for resistance against net blotch. Out of these, six QTL are considered novel showing no correspondence to previously reported QTL for net blotch resistance. Overall, variation of net blotch resistance in HEB-25 turned out to be controlled by small effect QTL. Results indicate the presence of alleles in HEB-25 differing in their effect on net blotch resistance. Results provide valuable information regarding the genetic architecture of the complex barley-P. teres f. teres interaction as well as for the improvement of net blotch resistance of elite barley cultivars. labels: #Ascomycota#Disease Resistance#Genotype#Hordeum#Plant Diseases#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Quantitative Trait Loci'
b'BACKGROUND: Individuals with schizophrenia who are involuntarily admitted may have poorer prognosis, including higher readmission rates, than those voluntarily admitted. However, little is known about the risk factors for readmission in those schizophrenia patients who are involuntarily admitted.AIMS: We aim to explore the risk factors for readmission in this population.METHOD: We enrolled 138 schizophrenia patients with involuntary admission from July 2008 to June 2013 and followed those patients for readmission outcomes at 3 months and at 1 year.RESULTS: The one-year and 3-months readmission rates were 33.3% and 15.2%, respectively. Unmarried status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.28, 95% CI: 1.48-26.62), previous history of involuntary admission (aOR = 4.08, 95% CI: 1.19-14.02), longer involuntary admission days (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07) and shorter total admission days (aOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) were associated with increased risk for 1-year readmission. Younger age (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18) was associated with increased risk for 3-months readmission.CONCLUSIONS: Unmarried status, prior history of involuntary admission, longer involuntary admission days and shorter total admission days were associated with increased risk for 1-year readmission. Healthcare providers may need to focus on patients with these risk factors to reduce subsequent readmissions. labels: #Adult#Commitment of Mentally Ill#Female#Humans#Male#Patient Readmission#Risk Factors#Schizophrenia#Socioeconomic Factors#Taiwan#Time Factors'
b'BACKGROUND: The weaning pig is used as an experimental model to assess the impact of diet on intestinal health. Blood parameters (BP) are considered a useful tool in humans, but there is very scarce information of such indicators in the weaning pig. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the use of different BP as indicators in an experimental model of salmonellosis.METHODOLOGY: Seventy-two 28-day-old piglets were divided into four groups in a 2x2 factorial arrangement, with animals receiving or not a probiotic combination based on B. infantis IM1\xc2\xae and B. lactis BPL6 (109 colony forming units (cfu)/d) and orally challenged or not a week later with Salmonella Typhimurium (5x108 cfu). Blood samples of one animal per pen (N = 24) were taken four days post-inoculation for the evaluation of different BP using an I-stat\xc2\xae System and of plasmatic concentrations of zinc, iron and copper.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Results reported marginal deficiencies of zinc in piglets at weaning. Moreover, plasmatic zinc, copper and iron presented good correlations with weight gain (r 0.57, r -0.67, r 0.54 respectively; P<0.01). Blood electrolytes (Na+, Cl- and K+) decreased (P<0.01) only when the performance of the animals was seriously compromised and clinical symptoms were more apparent. Acid-base balance parameters such as HCO3-, TCO2 and BEecf significantly correlated with weight gain, but only in the challenged animals (r -0.54, r -0.55, and r -0.51, respectively; P<0.05), suggesting metabolic acidosis depending on Salmonella infection. Glucose was affected by the challenge (P = 0.040), while Htc and Hgb increased with the challenge and decreased with the probiotic (P<0.05). Furthermore, correlations of Glu, Htc and Hgb with weight gain were observed (P<0.05). Overall, BP could be regarded as simple, useful indexes to assess performance and health of weaning piglets. labels: #Acid-Base Equilibrium#Animals#Biomarkers#Blood Glucose#Disease Models, Animal#Metals#Salmonella#Salmonella Infections#Swine#Swine Diseases'
b'The question of withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration from people in a permanent vegetative state sparks considerable ethical and legal debate. Therefore, understanding the elements that influence such a decision is crucial. However, exploring perceptions of artificial nutrition and hydration is methodologically challenging for several reasons. First, because of the emotional state of the professionals and family members, who are facing an extremely distressing situation; second, because this question mirrors representations linked to a deep-rooted fear of dying of hunger and thirst; and third, because of taboos surrounding death. We sought to determine the best method to explore such complex situations in depth. This article aims to assess the relevance of the photo-elicitation interview method to analyze the perceptions and attitudes of health professionals and families of people in a permanent vegetative state regarding artificial nutrition and hydration. The photo-elicitation interview method consists in inserting one or more photographs into a research interview. An original set of 60 photos was built using Google Images and participants were asked to choose photos (10 maximum) and talk about them. The situations of 32 patients were explored in 23 dedicated centers for people in permanent vegetative state across France. In total, 138 interviews were conducted with health professionals and family members. We found that the photo-elicitation interview method 1) was well accepted by the participants and allowed them to express their emotions constructively, 2) fostered narration, reflexivity and introspection, 3) offered a sufficient "unusual angle" to allow participants to go beyond stereotypes and habits of thinking, and 4) can be replicated in other research areas. The use of visual methods currently constitutes an expanding area of research and this study stressed that this is of special interest to enhance research among populations facing end-of-life and ethical issues. labels: #Caregivers#Family#Female#Humans#Male#Parenteral Nutrition#Perception#Persistent Vegetative State#Photography#Physicians'
b'We conducted two studies of circadian misalignment in non-Hispanic African and European-Americans. In the first, the sleep/wake (light/dark) schedule was advanced 9 h, similar to flying east, and in the second these schedules were delayed 9 h, similar to flying west or sleeping during the day after night work. We confirmed that the free-running circadian period is shorter in African-Americans compared to European-Americans, and found differences in the magnitude and direction of circadian rhythm phase shifts which were related to the circadian period. The sleep and cognitive performance data from the first study (published in this journal) documented the impairment in both ancestry groups due to this extreme circadian misalignment. African-Americans slept less and performed slightly worse during advanced/misaligned days than European-Americans. The current analysis is of sleep and cognitive performance from the second study. Participants were 23 African-Americans and 22 European-Americans (aged 18-44 years). Following four baseline days (8 h time in bed, based on habitual sleep), the sleep/wake schedule was delayed by 9 h for three days. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy. During the last two baseline/aligned days and the first two delayed/misaligned days, beginning 2 h after waking, cognitive performance was assessed every 3 h using the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery. Mixed model ANOVAs assessed the effects of ancestry (African-American or European-American) and condition (baseline/aligned or delayed/misaligned) on sleep and performance. There was decreased sleep and impaired cognitive performance in both ancestry groups during the two delayed/misaligned days relative to baseline/aligned days. Sleep and cognitive performance did not differ between African-Americans and European-Americans during either baseline/aligned or delayed/misaligned days. While our previous work showed that an advance in the sleep/wake schedule impaired the sleep of African-Americans more than European-Americans, delaying the sleep/wake schedule impaired the sleep and cognitive performance of African-Americans and European-Americans equally. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#African Americans#Circadian Rhythm#Cognition#European Continental Ancestry Group#Female#Humans#Male#Sleep#Wakefulness'
b'Here we made an attempt to obtain partial structural information on the topology of multispan integral membrane proteins of yeast by isolating organellar membranes, removing peripheral membrane proteins at pH 11.5 and introducing chemical crosslinks between vicinal amino acids either using homo- or hetero-bifunctional crosslinkers. Proteins were digested with specific proteases and the products analysed by mass spectrometry. Dedicated software tools were used together with filtering steps optimized to remove false positive crosslinks. In proteins of known structure, crosslinks were found only between loops residing on the same side of the membrane. As may be expected, crosslinks were mainly found in very abundant proteins. Our approach seems to hold to promise to yield low resolution topological information for naturally very abundant or strongly overexpressed proteins with relatively little effort. Here, we report novel XL-MS-based topology data for 17 integral membrane proteins (Akr1p, Fks1p, Gas1p, Ggc1p, Gpt2p, Ifa38p, Ist2p, Lag1p, Pet9p, Pma1p, Por1p, Sct1p, Sec61p, Slc1p, Spf1p, Vph1p, Ybt1p). labels: #Cross-Linking Reagents#Mass Spectrometry#Membrane Proteins#Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins'
b'Tmprss6-mutated mask mice display iron deficiency anemia and high expression of hepcidin. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of erythropoietin administration on proteins participating in the control of iron homeostasis in the liver and spleen in C57BL/6 and mask mice. Administration of erythropoietin for four days at 50 IU/mouse/day increased hemoglobin and hematocrit in C57BL/6 mice, no such increase was seen in mask mice. Erythropoietin administration decreased hepcidin expression in C57BL/6 mice, but not in mask mice. Erythropoietin treatment significantly increased the spleen size in both C57BL/6 and mask mice. Furthermore, erythropoietin administration increased splenic Fam132b, Fam132a and Tfr2 mRNA content. At the protein level, erythropoietin increased the amount of splenic erythroferrone and transferrin receptor 2 both in C57BL/6 and mask mice. Splenic ferroportin content was decreased in erythropoietin-treated mask mice in comparison with erythropoietin-treated C57BL/6 mice. In mask mice, the amount of liver hemojuvelin was decreased in comparison with C57BL/6 mice. The pattern of hemojuvelin cleavage was different between C57BL/6 and mask mice: In both groups, a main hemojuvelin band was detected at approximately 52 kDa; in C57BL/6 mice, a minor cleaved band was seen at 47 kDa. In mask mice, the 47 kDa band was absent, but additional minor bands were detected at approximately 45 kDa and 48 kDa. The results provide support for the interaction between TMPRSS6 and hemojuvelin in vivo; they also suggest that hemojuvelin could be cleaved by another as yet unknown protease in the absence of functional TMPRSS6. The lack of effect of erythropoietin on hepcidin expression in mask mice can not be explained by changes in erythroferrone synthesis, as splenic erythroferrone content increased after erythropoietin administration in both C57BL/6 and mask mice. labels: #Animals#Cytokines#Erythropoietin#Gene Expression Regulation#Hepcidins#Iron#Liver#Membrane Proteins#Mice#Mice, Mutant Strains#Muscle Proteins#Organ Size#RNA-Binding Proteins#Serine Endopeptidases#Spleen'
b'Presently, climate change has increased the frequency of extreme meteorological events such as tropical cyclones. In the western Pacific basin, these cyclones are called typhoons, and in this area, around Taiwan Island, their frequency has almost doubled since 2000. When approaching landmasses, typhoons have devastating effects on coastal vegetation. The increased frequency of these events has challenged the survival of coastal plant species and their posttyphoon recovery. In this study, a population of coastal gynodioecious Ficus pedunculosa var. mearnsii (Mearns fig) was surveyed for two years to investigate its recovery after Typhoon Morakot, which occurred in August 2009. Similar to all the Ficus species, the Mearns fig has an obligate mutualistic association with pollinating fig wasp species, which requires syconia (the closed Ficus inflorescence) to complete its life cycle. Moreover, male gynodioecious fig species produces both pollen and pollen vectors, whereas the female counterpart produces only seeds. The recovery of the Mearns fig was observed to be rapid, with the production of both leaves and syconia. The syconium:leaf ratio was greater for male trees than for female trees, indicating the importance of syconium production for the wasp survival. Pollinating wasps live for approximately 1 day; therefore, receptive syconia are crucial. Every typhoon season, few typhoons pass by the coasts where the Mearns fig grows, destroying all the leaves and syconia. In this paper, we highlight the potential diminution of the fig population that can lead to the extinction of the mutualistic pair of species. The effects of climate change on coastal species warrant wider surveys. labels: #Animals#Climate Change#Cyclonic Storms#Ficus#Models, Biological#Pollination#Taiwan#Wasps'
b'We developed new quantitative palaeoclimatic inference models based on the body-size structure of mammal faunas from the Old World tropics and applied them to the Somosaguas fossil site (middle Miocene, central Iberian Peninsula). Twenty-six mammal species have been described at this site, including proboscideans, ungulates, carnivores, insectivores, lagomorphs and rodents. Our analyses were based on multivariate and bivariate regression models correlating climatic data and body-size structure of 63 modern mammal assemblages from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The results showed an average temperature of the coldest month higher than 26\xc2\xb0C for the Somosaguas fossil site, a mean annual thermal amplitude around 10\xc2\xb0C, a drought length of 10 months, and an annual total precipitation greater than 200 mm per year, which are climate conditions typical of an ecotonal zone between the savanna and desert biomes. These results are congruent with the aridity peaks described over the middle Aragonian of Spain and particularly in the local biozone E, which includes Somosaguas. The aridity increase detected in this biozone is associated with the Middle Miocene Global Cooling Event. The environment of Somosaguas around 14 Ma was similar to the current environment in the Sahel region of North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the boundary area between the Kalahari and the Namib in Southern Africa, south-central Arabia, or eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. The distribution of modern vegetation in these regions follows a complex mosaic of plant communities, dominated by scattered xerophilous shrublands, semidesert grasslands, and vegetation linked to seasonal watercourses and ponds. labels: #Animals#Body Size#Desert Climate#Fossils#Mammals#Spain'
b'Porcine circovirus-associated disease is caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection, which targets iliac artery endothelial cells (PIECs); it leads to severe immunopathologies and is associated with major economic losses in the porcine industry. Here, we report that in vitro PCV2 infection of PIECs causes cell injury, which affects DC function as well as adaptive immunity. Specifically, PCV2 infection downregulated PIEC antigen-presenting molecule expression, upregulated cytokines involved in the immune and inflammatory response causing cell damage and repair, and altered the migratory capacity of PIECs. In addition, PCV2-infected PIECs inhibited DC maturation, enhanced the endocytic ability of DCs, and weakened the stimulatory effect of DCs on T lymphocytes. Together, these findings indicate that profound functional impairment of DCs in the presence of PCV2-infected PIECs may be a potential pathogenic mechanism associated with PCV2-induced porcine disease. labels: #Animals#Cells, Cultured#Circoviridae Infections#Circovirus#Cytokines#Dendritic Cells#Endothelial Cells#Iliac Artery#Monocytes#Swine#T-Lymphocytes'
b'Plasma levels of FGF23 are increased in patients with chronic kidney disease. Beside its role in phosphate homeostasis, iron deficiency and anemia are associated with increased FGF23 plasma levels. Recently, FGF23 plasma levels were shown to be increased in mice after treatment with hypoxia inducible factor-proline hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors which are strong inducers of erythropoietin and erythropoiesis and are known to modulate iron uptake and availability. Therefore we investigated a potential context between expression of FGF23 and stimulation of erythropoiesis using a HIF-PH inhibitor and erythropoietin in rats. FGF23 plasma levels are induced at peak levels 2 h after intravenous injection of recombinant human Erythropoietin (rhEPO). Likewise induction of endogenous EPO using a HIF-PH inhibitor (BAY 85-3934) is followed by an increase of FGF23 plasma levels. In contrast to rhEPO the HIF-PH inhibitor induces lower peak levels of FGF23 applying equivalent hematopoietic doses. Bone and bone marrow were identified as sources of EPO-induced FGF23. Immediate induction of FGF23 mRNA was also detected in EPO receptor positive murine hematopoietic BAF3 cells after treatment with rhEPO but not after treatment with the HIF-PH inhibitor. Pretreatment of mice with a neutralizing anti-EPO antibody abrogated FGF23 induction by the HIF-PH inhibitor. Thus, direct impact on FGF23 expression by HIF-PH inhibition in vivo via hypoxia mimicking and modulation of iron metabolism appears unlikely. Collectively, the findings point to an EPO dependent regulation pathway of FGF23 gene expression which might be important in the context of erythropoiesis stimulating therapies in patients with renal anemia. labels: #Animals#Enzyme Inhibitors#Erythropoietin#Fibroblast Growth Factors#Gene Expression Regulation#Humans#Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases#Male#Mice#RNA, Messenger#Rats'
b'There is a paucity of health policy relevant data for chronic liver disease from India, impeding formulation of an interventional strategy to address the issue. A prospective, multicentric study to delineate the etiology and clinical profile of chronic liver disease in India is reported here. A centrally coordinated and monitored web-based data repository was developed (Feb, 2010 to Jan, 2013) and analyzed. Eleven hospitals from different parts of India participated. Data were uploaded into a web based proforma and monitored by a single centre according to a standardized protocol. 1.28% (n = 266621) of all patients (n = 20701383) attending the eleven participating hospitals of India had liver disease. 65807 (24\xc2\xb768%) were diagnosed for the first time (new cases). Of these, 13014 (19\xc2\xb777%, median age 43 years, 73% males) cases of chronic liver disease were finally analyzed. 33.9% presented with decompensated cirrhosis. Alcoholism (34\xc2\xb73% of 4413) was the commonest cause of cirrhosis while Hepatitis B (33\xc2\xb73%) was predominant cause of chronic liver disease in general and non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease (40\xc2\xb78% out of 8163). There was significant interregional differences (hepatitis C in North, hepatitis B in East and South, alcohol in North-east, Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in West) in the predominant cause of chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B (46\xc2\xb78% of 438 cases) was the commonest cause of hepatocellular Cancer.11\xc2\xb77% had diabetes. Observations of our study will help guide a contextually relevant liver care policy for India and could serve as a framework for similar endeavor in other developing countries as well. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Child#Child, Preschool#Chronic Disease#Female#Health Facilities#Health Services Accessibility#Humans#India#Infant#Liver Diseases#Male#Middle Aged#Young Adult'
b'IQGAPs is a family of proteins which comprises three members, in humans. The expression pattern and role of IQGAP1 has been well established in many cancers, whereas those of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, have mostly remained unexplored. We used available large datasets, to explore the pan-cancer status of these two genes in-silico. Here we have analysed their mRNA expression and correlation with survivability in eight different cancers, including lung, breast, gastric, brain, colorectal, prostate, liver and kidney cancers and, their subtypes. The mRNA expression of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 in individual cancers were analysed in two different publicly available databases viz. Oncomine and TCGA. The prognostic value of these genes in lung, breast and gastric cancer was analysed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, whereas for brain, colorectal, liver, prostate and kidney cancers, SurvExpress database was used. These results were validated by immunohistochemistry in cancer tissues (stomach, prostate, brain, colorectal). Moreover, we did IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 genomic alteration and, promoter methylation analysis using cBioportal and Wanderer web tool, respectively. Most of the cancer types (lung, breast, prostate, brain, gastric, liver, kidney and colorectal) showed increased IQGAP3 mRNA expression. In contrast, the IQGAP2 transcript levels were reduced across different cancers viz. lung, breast, gastric, liver, kidney and colorectal cancer. IQGAP2 expression correlated positively with survivability, on the contrary, IQGAP3 expression levels correlated inversely with survivability, in most of the cancers. Collectively, enhanced IQGAP3 and reduced IQGAP2 levels were frequently observed in multiple cancers with the former predicting poor survivability and the later opposite. Methylation pattern was significantly altered in most of the cancer types. We found copy no. variation and mutations in specific cancers, for IQGAP2 and IQGAP3. Our in-vivo (IHC) data confirmed the in-silico findings completely. Hence, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 have potential to be used as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in specific cancers. labels: #Computational Biology#DNA Methylation#Data Mining#GTPase-Activating Proteins#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Humans#Neoplasm Staging#Neoplasms#Prognosis#Promoter Regions, Genetic#ras GTPase-Activating Proteins'
b'PURPOSE: To study the effect of torsional phacoemulsification energy on corneal endothelium evaluating the relationship between changes of endothelial cells and postoperative visual acuity.METHODS: This prospective clinical observational cohort study included 50 patients with cataract who underwent torsional phacoemulsification. Sequential quantitative and qualitative morphometric endothelial cell analyses of the cornea were performed four weeks preoperatively and six weeks postoperatively using noncontact specular microscopy.RESULTS: This work confirmed the strong relationship, described by a linear model (one-way ANOVA, R2 = 77.9%, P<0.0001), between the percentage of endothelial cell loss (ECL%) and the 5-score harm scale. According to the Tukey post-hoc pairwise comparison test, distinct values of ECL% are grouped in 3 subsets. The value of ECL = 10% has been identified as cut-off to discriminate patients with excellent postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA>85 letters) from those with just a good/satisfied visual outcome (BCVA \xe2\x89\xa4 85 letters). Within the 5-score harm scale, there was a significant correlation among phaco energy intraoperatively delivered and the average endothelial cell loss.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the validity of the 5-score harm scale first proposed by Sorrentino and colleagues in 2016. This time, the method categorizes cataracts taking into account nucleus hardness and phaco cumulative dissipated energy. Predicting the harm on corneal endothelium, we can discriminate patients with excellent BCVA and with just good/satisfied BCVA. With torsional phacoemulsification with respect to longitudinal, the percentage of patients who can reach excellent BCVA is remarkably increased. labels: #Endothelium, Corneal#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Phacoemulsification#Pilot Projects#Prospective Studies#Visual Acuity'
b'Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease driving inflammatory and degenerative processes that damage the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is not well understood how these events interact and evolve to evoke such a highly dynamic and heterogeneous disease. We established a hypothesis whereby the variability in the course of MS is driven by the very same pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disease, the autoimmune attack on the CNS that leads to chronic inflammation, neuroaxonal degeneration and remyelination. We propose that each of these processes acts more or less severely and at different times in each of the clinical subgroups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model that was constrained by experimental data (the expanded disability status scale [EDSS] time series) obtained from a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 66 MS patients with a long-term follow-up (up to 20 years). Moreover, we validated this model in a second prospective cohort of 120 MS patients with a three-year follow-up, for which EDSS data and brain volume time series were available. The clinical heterogeneity in the datasets was reduced by grouping the EDSS time series using an unsupervised clustering analysis. We found that by adjusting certain parameters, albeit within their biological range, the mathematical model reproduced the different disease courses, supporting the dynamic CNS damage hypothesis to explain MS heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests that the irreversible axon degeneration produced in the early stages of progressive MS is mainly due to the higher rate of myelinated axon degeneration, coupled to the lower capacity for remyelination. However, and in agreement with recent pathological studies, degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons is not a key feature that distinguishes this phenotype. Moreover, the model reveals that lower rates of axon degeneration and more rapid remyelination make relapsing MS more resilient than the progressive subtype. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis for the different MS subtypes, even in the presence of genetic and environmental heterogeneity. Hence, MS can be considered as a single disease in which specific dynamics can provoke a variety of clinical outcomes in different patient groups. These results have important implications for the design of therapeutic interventions for MS at different stages of the disease. labels: #Brain#Computational Biology#Databases, Factual#Humans#Image Processing, Computer-Assisted#Inflammation#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Multiple Sclerosis#Prospective Studies'
b'The effect of high pressure thermal (HPT) processing on the inactivation of spores of proteolytic type B Clostridium botulinum TMW 2.357 in four differently composed low-acid foods (green peas with ham, steamed sole, vegetable soup, braised veal) was studied in an industrially feasible pressure range and temperatures between 100 and 120\xc2\xb0C. Inactivation curves exhibited rapid inactivation during compression and decompression followed by strong tailing effects. The highest inactivation (approx. 6-log cycle reduction) was obtained in braised veal at 600 MPa and 110\xc2\xb0C after 300 s pressure-holding time. In general, inactivation curves exhibited similar negative exponential shapes, but maximum achievable inactivation levels were lower in foods with higher fat contents. At high treatment temperatures, spore inactivation was more effective at lower pressure levels (300 vs. 600 MPa), which indicates a non-linear pressure/temperature-dependence of the HPT spore inactivation efficiency. A comparison of spore inactivation levels achievable using HPT treatments versus a conventional heat sterilization treatment (121.1\xc2\xb0C, 3 min) illustrates the potential of combining high pressures and temperatures to replace conventional retorting with the possibility to reduce the process temperature or shorten the processing time. Finally, experiments using varying spore inoculation levels suggested the presence of a resistant fraction comprising approximately 0.01% of a spore population as reason for the pronounced tailing effects in survivor curves. The loss of the high resistance properties upon cultivation indicates that those differences develop during sporulation and are not linked to permanent modifications at the genetic level. labels: #Clostridium botulinum type B#Food Microbiology#Hot Temperature#Microbial Viability#Nonlinear Dynamics#Pressure#Spores, Bacterial'
b'Cuticular waxes of plant and organ surfaces play an important role in protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stress and extending the freshness, storage time and shelf life in the post-harvest agricultural products. WRI1, a transcription factor of AP2/SHEN families, had been found to trigger the related genes taking part in the biosynthesis of seed oil in many plants. But whether WRI1 is involved in the biosynthesis of the cuticular waxes on the Malus fruits surface has been unclear. We investigated the changes of wax composition and structure, the related genes and WRI1 expression on Malus asiatica Nakai and sieversii fruits with the low temperature treatments, found that low temperature induced the up-regulated expression of McWRI1, which promoted gene expression of McKCS, McLACs and McWAX in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, resulting in the accumulation of alkanes component and alteration of wax structure on the fruit surface. Corresponding results were verified in McWRI1 silenced by VIGS, and WRI1 silenced down-regulated the related genes on two kinds of fruits, it caused the diversity alteration in content of some alkanes, fatty acid and ester component in two kinds of fruits. We further conducted Y1H assay to find that McWRI1 transcription factor activated the promoter of McKCS, McLAC and McWAX to regulate their expression. These results demonstrated that McWRI1 is involved in regulating the genes related synthesis of very long chain fatty acid on surface of apple fruits in storage process, providing a highlight for improvement of the modified atmosphere storage of apple fruits. labels: #Cloning, Molecular#DNA, Complementary#Fruit#Gene Expression Regulation, Plant#Gene Silencing#Malus#Mutation#Plant Proteins#Promoter Regions, Genetic#Stress, Physiological#Temperature#Transcription Factors#Waxes'
b"Sleep loss causes profound cognitive impairments and increases the concentrations of adenosine and adenosine A1 receptors in specific regions of the brain. Time courses for performance impairment and recovery differ between acute and chronic sleep loss, but the physiological basis for these time courses is unknown. Adenosine has been implicated in pathways that generate sleepiness and cognitive impairments, but existing mathematical models of sleep and cognitive performance do not explicitly include adenosine. Here, we developed a novel receptor-ligand model of the adenosine system to test the hypothesis that changes in both adenosine and A1 receptor concentrations can capture changes in cognitive performance during acute sleep deprivation (one prolonged wake episode), chronic sleep restriction (multiple nights with insufficient sleep), and subsequent recovery. Parameter values were estimated using biochemical data and reaction time performance on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). The model closely fit group-average PVT data during acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and recovery. We tested the model's ability to reproduce timing and duration of sleep in a separate experiment where individuals were permitted to sleep for up to 14 hours per day for 28 days. The model accurately reproduced these data, and also correctly predicted the possible emergence of a split sleep pattern (two distinct sleep episodes) under these experimental conditions. Our findings provide a physiologically plausible explanation for observed changes in cognitive performance and sleep during sleep loss and recovery, as well as a new approach for predicting sleep and cognitive performance under planned schedules. labels: #Adenosine#Attention#Brain#Cognition#Cognition Disorders#Computer Simulation#Humans#Models, Neurological#Psychomotor Performance#Reaction Time#Recovery of Function#Sleep#Sleep Deprivation"
b'Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) has been widely used for analyses of nucleosome locations in many organisms. However, due to its sequence preference, the interpretations of the positions and occupancies of nucleosomes using MNase have remained controversial. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has also been utilized for analyses of MNase-digests, but some technical biases are commonly present in the NGS experiments. Here, we established a gel-based method to map nucleosome positions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using isolated nuclei as the substrate for the histone H4 S47C-site-directed chemical cleavage in parallel with MNase digestion. The parallel mapping allowed us to compare the chemically and enzymatically cleaved sites by indirect end-labeling and primer extension mapping, and thus we could determine the nucleosome positions and the sizes of the nucleosome-free regions (or nucleosome-depleted regions) more accurately, as compared to nucleosome mapping by MNase alone. The analysis also revealed that the structural features of the nucleosomes flanked by the nucleosome-free region were different from those within regularly arrayed nucleosomes, showing that the structures and dynamics of individual nucleosomes strongly depend on their locations. Moreover, we demonstrated that the parallel mapping results were generally consistent with the previous genome-wide chemical mapping and MNase-Seq results. Thus, the gel-based parallel mapping will be useful for the analysis of a specific locus under various conditions. labels: #Aldose-Ketose Isomerases#Chromosome Mapping#DNA, Fungal#Genetic Loci#Hydroxyl Radical#Micrococcal Nuclease#Nucleosomes#Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins'
b"When ascending (descending) a slope, positive (negative) work must be performed to overcome changes in gravitational potential energy at the center of body mass (COM). This modifies the pendulum-like behavior of walking. The aim of this study is to analyze how energy exchange and mechanical work done vary within a step across slopes and speeds. Ten subjects walked on an instrumented treadmill at different slopes (from -9\xc2\xb0 to 9\xc2\xb0), and speeds (between 0.56 and 2.22 m s-1). From the ground reaction forces, we evaluated energy of the COM, recovery (i.e. the potential-kinetic energy transduction) and pendular energy savings (i.e. the theoretical reduction in work due to this recovered energy) throughout the step. When walking uphill as compared to level, pendular energy savings increase during the first part of stance (when the COM is lifted) and decreases during the second part. Conversely in downhill walking, pendular energy savings decrease during the first part of stance and increase during the second part (when the COM is lowered). In uphill and downhill walking, the main phase of external work occurs around double support. Uphill, the positive work phase is extended during the beginning of single support to raise the body. Downhill, the negative work phase starts before double support, slowing the downward velocity of the body. Changes of the pendulum-like behavior as a function of slope can be illustrated by tilting the 'classical compass model' backwards (uphill) or forwards (downhill). labels: #Energy Metabolism#Exercise Test#Humans#Male#Walking#Young Adult"
b'The role of river discharge, wind and tide on the extension and variability of the Tagus River plume was analyzed from 2003 to 2015. This study was performed combining daily images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor located onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. Composites were generated by averaging pixels with the same forcing conditions. River discharge shows a strong relation with the extension of the Tagus plume. The plume grows with the increasing river discharge and express a two day lag caused by the long residence time of water within the estuary. The Tagus turbid plume was found to be smaller under northerly and easterly winds, than under southerly and westerly winds. It is suggested that upwelling favoring winds provoke the offshore movement of the plume material with a rapidly decrease in turbidity values whereas downwelling favoring winds retain plume material in the north coast close to the Tagus mouth. Eastern cross-shore (oceanward) winds spread the plume seaward and to the north following the coast geometry, whereas western cross-shore (landward) winds keep the plume material in both alongshore directions occupying a large part of the area enclosed by the bay. Low tides produce larger and more turbid plumes than high tides. In terms of fortnightly periodicity, the maximum plume extension corresponding to the highest turbidity is observed during and after spring tides. Minimum plume extension associated with the lowest turbidity occurs during and after neap tides. labels: #Droughts#Environmental Monitoring#Floods#Rivers#Satellite Imagery#Spain#Wind'
b'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the effect of weather and air pollution on the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been investigated, results have remained inconsistent. The present study aimed to determine the seasonality of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurrence and mortality.METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample database to evaluate the effect of meteorological factors and air pollutants on patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage in Korea between 2011 and 2014. Monthly variations in SAH occurrence and mortality were analyzed using locally weighted scatter plot smoothing curves. Multivariate Poisson generalized linear regression models were used to evaluate potential independent meteorological and pollutant variables associated with SAH occurrence and mortality.RESULTS: In total, 21,407 patients who underwent clip or coil treatment owing to aneurysmal SAH in Korea from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014, were included. The crude incidence rate of SAH in Korea was 10.5 per 100,000 people per year. An approximately 0.5% lower risk of SAH was observed per 1\xc2\xb0C increase in mean monthly temperature (relative risk, 0.995; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.992-0.997; p<0.001), while an approximately 2.3% higher risk of SAH was observed per 1\xc2\xb0C increase in mean monthly diurnal temperature.CONCLUSIONS: We showed distinct patterns of seasonal and monthly variation in the occurrence and mortality of SAH. Our findings suggest that meteorological factors may play an important role in monthly variations in the occurrence of aneurysmal SAH. labels: #Air Pollution#Female#Humans#Incidence#Male#Middle Aged#Subarachnoid Hemorrhage#Temperature#Weather'
b'Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). But few studies have addressed the effect of statins on the incidence of this arrhythmia in patients with hypertension. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of statins on new-onset of this arrhythmia in a hypertensive population, accounting for AF risk. Data from the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care was used to recruit a retrospective cohort of \xe2\x89\xa555-year-old hypertensive individuals with no ischemic vascular disease, in 2006-2007, followed up through 2015. The effect of initiating statin treatment on new-onset atrial fibrillation was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted by the propensity score of receiving statin treatment, in the overall study population and stratified by AF risk. Of 100 276 included participants, 9814 initiated statin treatment. The AF incidence per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval) was 12.5 (12.3-12.8). Statin use associated with a significant (9%) reduction in AF incidence. Differences in absolute AF incidence were higher in the highest AF risk subgroup, and the estimated number needed to treat to avoid one case was 720. The relative effect was poor, similar across groups, and non-significant, as was the association of statins with adverse effects. We found a limited protective effect of statins over new-onset AF in this hypertensive population with no ischemic vascular disease. If there is no further indication, hypertensive patients would not benefit from statin use solely for AF primary prevention. labels: #Aged#Atrial Fibrillation#Electronic Health Records#Female#Humans#Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors#Hypertension#Male#Retrospective Studies#Risk'
b'The effectiveness of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells for treatment of cancers has long been appreciated. Here, we report for the first time that CIK cells can be applied to treat allergic airway inflammation. Adopting from an established protocol with some modifications, we generated CIK cells ex vivo from mouse T cells, and examined their effectiveness in treatment of allergic airway inflammation using the ovalbumin-induced model of allergic airway inflammation. Based upon evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, T helper type2 cytokine levels and lung histology, all of which are important parameters for determining the severity of allergic airway inflammation, diseased mice treated with CIK cells showed significant reductions in all the parameters without any obvious adverse effects. Interestingly, the observed effects were comparable to those treated with dexamethasone. Thus, our study provides a novel application of CIK cells in treatment of allergic airway inflammation. labels: #Animals#Asthma#Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy#Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells#Cytokines#Eosinophils#Goblet Cells#Hyperplasia#Hypersensitivity#Killer Cells, Natural#Male#Mice#Th1 Cells'
b'More than 1,500 fish species are hermaphroditic, but no hermaphroditic lineage appears to be evolutionarily ancient in fishes. Thus, whether more than one sex at a time was present during the evolutionary shift from gonochorism to hermaphroditism in fishes is an intriguing question. Ectopic oocytes were created in the ovotestes of protandrous black porgy via the withdrawal of estradiol (E2) administration. These ectopic oocytes reprogrammed the surrounding cells, which changed from Sertoli cells to follicle-like cells. We observed that gdf9 and bmp15 expression was localized in the primary oocytes and gradually decreased after oocytes entered a secondary oocyte stage. Robust expression of gdf9 and bmp15 in ectopic oocytes was associated with the surrounding Sertoli cells. However, blocking Cyp19a1a activity and increasing androgen levels did not stimulate the expression of gdf9 and bmp15. Thus, the robust gdf9 and bmp15 expression was not related to the inappropriate male microenvironment. Furthermore, in vitro data demonstrated that gdf9 and bmp15 were not downstream genes of Figla signaling. Therefore, our results suggest that there are two independent mechanisms, a Figla-dependent pathway and a Figla-independent pathway, by which oocyte-surrounding cells are altered from a male somatic fate to a female somatic fate. This functional switch might clarify how oocytes created an appropriate microenvironment during the transition from the ancient gonochorism to the present hermaphroditism. labels: #Animals#Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors#Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15#Estradiol#Female#Fish Proteins#Gene Expression Regulation#Growth Differentiation Factor 9#Hermaphroditic Organisms#Male#Oocytes#Ovary#Perciformes#Sertoli Cells#Signal Transduction#Testis#Vitellogenesis'
b"Serine-proteases are important players in the pathogenesis of asthma, promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling. It's also known that many serine protease inhibitors display immunomodulatory properties. TgPI-1 is a Toxoplasma gondii protein that exhibits broad spectrum inhibitory activity against serine proteases. In view of the increased prevalence of atopic disorders and the need to develop new treatment strategies we sought to investigate the potential of TgPI-1 for treating respiratory allergies. For this purpose, we developed a therapeutic experimental model. BALB/c mice were rendered allergic by intraperitoneal ovalbumin-alum sensitization and airway-challenged. Once the asthmatic phenotype was achieved, mice were intranasally treated with rTgPI-1 alone or with a mixture of rTgPI-1 and ovalbumin (OVA). A week later mice were given a secondary aerosol challenge. Treatment with rTgPI-1 alone or co-administered with OVA diminished bronchoalveolar eosinophilia, mucus production and peribronchial lung infiltration. This effect was accompanied by a lung resistance reduction of 26.3% and 50.3% respectively. Both treatments resulted in the production of lower levels of IL-4, IL-5, IFN-\xce\xb3 and regulatory IL-10 by thoracic lymph node cells stimulated with OVA. Interestingly, significant decreases in OVA specific IgE and T cell proliferation, and increases in FoxP3+ T cells at local and systemic levels were only detected when the inhibitor was administered along with OVA. These results show that both rTgPI-1 treatments reduced asthma hallmarks. However, co-administration of the inhibitor with the allergen was more effective. Hence, rTgPI-1 emerges as a novel adjuvant candidate for asthma treatment. labels: #Allergens#Animals#Antibodies, Protozoan#Antibody Specificity#Asthma#Cell Proliferation#Cytokines#Drug Interactions#Forkhead Transcription Factors#Mice#Mice, Inbred BALB C#Ovalbumin#Recombinant Proteins#Serine Proteinase Inhibitors#T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory#Toxoplasma"
b'Acute inflammation is an immediate response to infection and injury characterised by the influx of granulocytes followed by phagocytosing mononuclear phagocytes. Provided the antigen is cleared and the immune system of the host is fully functional, the acute inflammatory response will resolve. Until now it is considered that resolution then leads back to homeostasis, the physiological state tissues experienced before inflammation occurred. Using a human model of acute inflammation driven by intradermal UV killed Escherichia coli, we found that bacteria and granulocyte clearance as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine catabolism occurred by 72h. However, following a lag phase of about 4 days there was an increase in numbers of memory T cells and CD163+ macrophage at the post-resolution site up to day 17 as well as increased biosynthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived prostanoids and DHA-derived D series resolvins. Inhibiting post-resolution prostanoids using naproxen showed that numbers of tissue memory CD4 cells were under the endogenous control of PGE2, which exerts its suppressive effects on T cell proliferation via the EP4 receptor. In addition, we re-challenged the post-resolution site with a second injection of E. coli, which when compared to saline controls resulted in primarily a macrophage-driven response with comparatively fewer PMNs; the macrophage-dominated response was reversed by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Re-challenge experiments were also carried out in mice where we obtained similar results as in humans. Therefore, we report that acute inflammatory responses in both humans and rodents do not revert back to homeostasis, but trigger a hitherto unappreciated sequence of immunological events that dictate subsequent immune response to infection. labels: #Acute Disease#Adult#Animals#Antigens, CD#Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic#Cell Count#Cell Proliferation#Dinoprostone#Escherichia coli#Female#Humans#Inflammation#Macrophages#Male#Mice#Microbial Viability#Middle Aged#Receptors, Cell Surface#T-Lymphocytes#Ultraviolet Rays#Young Adult'
b"Copper, as the third most abundant transition metal ions of human, plays an essential role in the redox reaction, signal transduction, hematopoiesis, and other physiological processes. Abnormal content of copper ions in the body will cause some diseases such as anemia, coronary heart disease, Menkes' syndrome. In this article, a new fluorescence probe L for Cu2+ was designed and synthetized by using 4-bromo-1,8 naphthalene anhydride and 2-thiophene formaldehyde as raw materials. Fluorescent probe L itself exhibited strong fluorescence, upon the addition of Cu2+ ions, the fluorescence was quenched. The fluorescent detection limit for Cu2+ ions was determined to be 1.8 \xce\xbcM based on a 3\xce\xb4/S method. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra indicated that probe L showed good selectivity and sensitivity for Cu2+, and this selectivity was not interfered by other metal ions and anions. Further cell fluorescence imaging experiments indicated that the probe L had potential to be used to examine copper ions in vivo. labels: #Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic#Copper#Drug Design#Fluorescent Dyes#Hydrogen-Ion Concentration#Limit of Detection#Naphthalenes"
b"OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in patient experience and consistency between hospital trusts and settings.METHODS: Observational study of publicly available patient experience surveys of three hospital settings (inpatients (IP), accident and emergency (A&E) and outpatients (OP)) of 130 acute NHS hospital trusts in England between 2004/05 and 2014/15.RESULTS: Overall patient experience has been good, showing modest improvements over time across the three hospital settings. Individual questions with the biggest improvement across all three settings are cleanliness (IP: +7.1, A&E: +6.5, OP: +4.7) and information about danger signals (IP: +3.8, A&E: +3.9, OP: +4.0). Trust performance has been consistent over time: 71.5% of trusts ranked in the same cluster for more than five years. There is some consistency across settings, especially between outpatients and inpatients. The lowest-scoring questions, regarding information at discharge, are the same in all years and all settings.CONCLUSIONS: The greatest improvement across all three settings has been for cleanliness, which has seen national policies and targets. Information about danger signals and medication side-effects showed least consistency across settings and scores have remained low over time, despite information about danger signals showing a big increase in score. Patient experience of aspects of access and waiting have declined, as has experience of discharge delay, likely reflecting known increases in pressure on England's NHS. labels: #England#Hospitals#Humans#National Health Programs#Patient Satisfaction#Trust"
b'In standard cage (SC) raised mice, experience-dependent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) rapidly declines with age: in postnatal day 25-35 (critical period) mice, 4 days of monocular deprivation (MD) are sufficient to induce OD-shifts towards the open eye; thereafter, 7 days of MD are needed. Beyond postnatal day 110, even 14 days of MD failed to induce OD-plasticity in mouse V1. In contrast, mice raised in a so-called "enriched environment" (EE), exhibit lifelong OD-plasticity. EE-mice have more voluntary physical exercise (running wheels), and experience more social interactions (bigger housing groups) and more cognitive stimulation (regularly changed labyrinths or toys). Whether experience-dependent shifts of V1-activation happen faster in EE-mice and how long the plasticity promoting effect would persist after transferring EE-mice back to SCs has not yet been investigated. To this end, we used intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize V1-activation i) before and after MD in EE-mice of different age groups (from 1-9 months), and ii) after transferring mice back to SCs after postnatal day 130. Already after 2 days of MD, and thus much faster than in SC-mice, EE-mice of all tested age groups displayed a significant OD-shift towards the open eye. Transfer of EE-mice to SCs immediately abolished OD-plasticity: already after 1 week of SC-housing and MD, OD-shifts could no longer be visualized. In an attempt to rescue abolished OD-plasticity of these mice, we either administered the anti-depressant fluoxetine (in drinking water) or supplied a running wheel in the SCs. OD-plasticity was only rescued for the running wheel- mice. Altogether our results show that raising mice in less deprived environments like large EE-cages strongly accelerates experience-dependent changes in V1-activation compared to the impoverished SC-raising. Furthermore, preventing voluntary physical exercise of EE-mice in adulthood immediately precludes OD-shifts in V1. labels: #Aging#Animal Husbandry#Animals#Dominance, Ocular#Environment#Female#Fluoxetine#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Neuronal Plasticity#Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors#Time Factors#Visual Cortex'
b"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association released 7 modifiable factors, Life's Simple 7, that are expected to improve cardiovascular health (CVH), but their contributions to ischemic heart disease (IHD) in the general Australians are not well clarified.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study based on 7499 adults (\xe2\x89\xa518 years) who have tested for total cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose as part of 2011-12 Australian Health Survey. Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate the incidence rate ratios and population attributable fractions of those factors to IHD prevalence. Participants were classified into three CVH groups based on the number of ideal metrics: inadequate (0-2), average (3-4), and optimal (5-7). Logistic regression analyses were performed to elucidate the relationship between overall CVH and IHD prevalence.RESULTS: 357 participants were self-reported having IHD condition, with a weighted prevalence of 3.3%. Physical inactivity, elevated body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol (TC) were independently associated with IHD. Compared to the inadequate category, participants in the optimal and average categories have a 78% [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03-1.96] and a 45% (adjusted OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.77) lower IHD risk. One more optimal metric was associated with an 18% lower IHD risk (adjusted OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.93).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that physical inactivity, raised BMI and elevated TC were independent modifiable risk factors of IHD in the general Australian population. The improvement of overall CVH may also reduce IHD risk among the general Australian adults. labels: #Adult#Australia#Coronary Artery Disease#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Prevalence#Risk Factors"
b"Academic dishonesty has been and continues to be a major problem in America's schools and universities. Such dishonesty is especially important in high schools, where grades earned directly impact the academic careers of students for many years to come. The rising pressure to get the best grades in school, get into the best college, and land the best paying job is a cycle that has made academic dishonesty increase exponentially. Thus, finding the widespread roots of cheating is more important now than ever. In this study, we focus on how societal norms and interactions with peers influence lying about scores in order to obtain a benefit in a high school population. We show that (1) the societal norms that go hand in hand with test-taking in school, as administered by a teacher, significantly dampen small-scale dishonesty, perhaps suggesting that context-dependent rewards offset cheating; (2) providing reminders of societal norms via pre-reported average scores leads to more truthful self-reporting of honesty; (3) the matrix search task was shown to not depend on class difficulty, confirming its effectiveness as an appropriate method for this study; (4) males seem to cheat more than females; and (5) teenagers are more dishonest earlier in the day. We suggest that students understand that cheating is wrong, an idea backed up by the literature, and that an environment which clearly does not condone dishonesty helps dampen widespread cheating in certain instances. This dampening effect seems to be dependent on the reward that students thought they would get for exaggerating their performance. labels: #Adult#Deception#Female#Humans#Male#Reward#United States#Universities#Young Adult"
b"Almost 1600 individuals from the Polish population were recruited to this study. Among them 319 were fertile couples, 289 were recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) couples, and 131 were in the group of recurrent implantation failure (RIF) following in vitro fertilization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MTHFR c.c.677 C>T and c.c.1298 A>C polymorphisms' association with RSA and RIF. We used PCR-RFLP with HinfI (677 C>T) and MboII (1298 A>C) digestion. We observed a protective effect of the female AC genotype (OR = 0.64, p = 0.01) and the C allele (AC+CC genotypes; OR = 0.65, p = 0.009) against RSA. Moreover, 1298 AA/677 CT women were more frequent in RSA (31.14%) and RIF (25.20%) groups in comparison to fertile women (22.88%), although this difference was significant only in the case of RSA (p = 0.022, OR = 1.52). Male combined genotype analysis revealed no association with reproductive failure of their partners. Nevertheless, the female/male combination AA/AC of the 1298 polymorphism was more frequent in RSA couples (p = 0.049, OR = 1.49). However, the significant results became insignificant after Bonferroni correction. In addition, analysis of haplotypes showed significantly higher frequency of the C/C haplotype (1298 C/677 C) in the female control group than in the female RSA group (p = 0.03, OR = 0.77). Moreover, the association between elevated homocysteine (Hcy) level in plasma of RSA and RIF women and MTHFR polymorphisms was investigated but did not reveal significant differences. In conclusion, for clinical practice, it is better to check the homocysteine level in plasma and, if the Hcy level is increased, to recommend patients to take folic acid supplements rather than undergo screening of MTHFR for 1298 A>C and 677 C>T polymorphisms. labels: #Abortion, Habitual#Adult#Female#Humans#Male#Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)#Middle Aged#Poland#Polymorphism, Genetic#Pregnancy"
b'BACKGROUND: According to the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014, only approximately 37 percent of women deliver in a health facility. Among the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh, the facility delivery rate is lowest in the Sylhet division (22.6 percent) where we assessed the effect of integrated supply- and demand-side interventions on the facility-based delivery rate.METHODS: Population-based cohort data of pregnant women from an ongoing maternal and newborn health improvement study being conducted in a population of ~120,000 in Sylhet district were used. The study required collection and processing of biological samples immediately after delivery. Therefore, the project assembled various strategies to increase institutional delivery rates. The supply-side intervention included capacity expansion of the health facilities through service provider refresher training, 24/7 service coverage, additions of drugs and supplies, and incentives to the providers. The demand-side component involved financial incentives to cover expenses, a provision of emergency transport, and referral support to a tertiary-level hospital. We conducted a before-and-after observational study to assess the impact of the intervention in a total of 1,861 deliveries between December 2014 and November 2016.RESULTS: Overall, implementation of the intervention package was associated with 52.6 percentage point increase in the proportions of facility-based deliveries from a baseline rate of 25.0 percent to 77.6 percent in 24 months. We observed lower rates of institutional deliveries when only supply-side interventions were implemented. The proportion rose to 47.1 percent and continued increasing when the project emphasized addressing the financial barriers to accessing obstetric care in a health facility.CONCLUSIONS: An integrated supply- and demand-side intervention was associated with a substantial increase in institutional delivery. The package can be tailored to identify which combination of interventions may produce the optimum result and be scaled. Rigorous implementation research studies are needed to draw confident conclusions and to provide information about the costs, feasibility for scale-up and sustainability. labels: #Bangladesh#Cohort Studies#Female#Humans#Maternal Health Services#Pregnancy#Rural Health Services'
b'In order to study the long-term stability of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) singing behavior, the frequency and inter-pulse interval of fin whale 20 Hz vocalizations were observed over 10 years from 2003-2013 from bottom mounted hydrophones and seismometers in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The instrument locations extended from 40\xc2\xb0N to 48\xc2\xb0N and 130\xc2\xb0W to 125\xc2\xb0W with water depths ranging from 1500-4000 m. The inter-pulse interval (IPI) of fin whale song sequences was observed to increase at a rate of 0.54 seconds/year over the decade of observation. During the same time period, peak frequency decreased at a rate of 0.17 Hz/year. Two primary call patterns were observed. During the earlier years, the more commonly observed pattern had a single frequency and single IPI. In later years, a doublet pattern emerged, with two dominant frequencies and IPIs. Many call sequences in the intervening years appeared to represent a transitional state between the two patterns. The overall trend was consistent across the entire geographical span, although some regional differences exist. Understanding changes in acoustic behavior over long time periods is needed to help establish whether acoustic characteristics can be used to help determine population identity in a widely distributed, difficult to study species such as the fin whale. labels: #Animals#Fin Whale#Pacific Ocean#Sound Spectrography#Vocalization, Animal'
b'AIM: To describe the prevalence of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) in a random population sample and to evaluate its relationship with Mediterranean diet and with other potential cardiovascular risk factors such as serum uric acid and pulse pressure in individuals ranged 45 to 74 years.METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 1568 subjects (mean age 6.5 years, 43% males), randomly selected from the population. A fasting blood sample was obtained to determine glucose, lipids, and HbA1C levels. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed in non-diabetic subjects. PAD was evaluated by ankle-brachial index and/or having a prior diagnosis.RESULTS: PAD prevalence was 3.81% (95% CI, 2.97-4.87) for all participants. In men, PAD prevalence was significantly higher than in women [5.17% (95% CI, 3.74-7.11) vs. 2.78% (95% CI, 1.89-4.07); p = 0.014]. Serum uric acid in the upper quartile was associated with the highest odds ratio (OR) of PAD (for uric acid>6.1 mg/dl, OR = 4.31; 95% CI, 1.49-12.44). The remaining variables more strongly associated with PAD were: Heart rate>90 bpm (OR = 4.16; 95%CI, 1.62-10.65), pulse pressure in the upper quartile (\xe2\x89\xa5 54 mmHg) (OR = 3.82; 95%CI, 1.50-9.71), adherence to Mediterranean diet (OR = 2.73; 95% CI, 1.48-5.04), and former smoker status (OR = 2.04; 95%CI, 1.00-4.16).CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the existence of a low prevalence of peripheral artery disease in a population aged 45-74 years. Serum uric acid, pulse pressure and heart rate>90 bpm were strongly associated with peripheral artery disease. The direct association between Mediterranean diet and peripheral artery disease that we have found should be evaluated through a follow-up study under clinical practice conditions. labels: #Aged#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Peripheral Arterial Disease#Prediabetic State'
b'The purpose of this study is to compare the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of esophageal foreign body (FB) ingestion in adults between weekdays and holidays. This is a retrospective study including 1058 patients with esophageal FB ingestion from 2012 to 2016. Patient characteristics, the types and locations of FB, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients on weekdays and holidays. Furthermore, independent risk factors of complication on weekdays and holidays respectively were evaluated. The locations of FB, underlying diseases, and complications significantly differed between weekdays and holidays groups, while no difference was found in the types of FB. Patients got higher percentage of erosion complication on holidays than that on weekdays (60.8% vs 47.6%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that jujube shell was a significant predictor of complication on weekdays (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). However, complication was significantly associated with nonfood bolus FB ingestion on holidays (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Our data suggest that there were different clinicopathological characteristics of FB ingestion between weekdays and holidays, and more patients got complications on holidays. On holidays, a latex protector hood or an overtube should be applied to patients who swallowed nonfood bolus in order to reduce esophageal mucosal damage. labels: #Adult#Eating#Esophagus#Female#Foreign Bodies#Holidays#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors'
b'RATIONALE: Pancreatic hepatoid carcinoma (PHC) is a rare form of pancreatic malignancy mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in morphology, immunohistochemistry, and behavior. PHC usually has an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. Effective treatment strategies are lacking due to poor understanding and extreme rarity of such kind of malignancy. PATIENT CONCERNS:: we present the case of a 75-year-old man with tumors in the liver and the tail of pancreas that were detected in a routine health check-up.DIAGNOSES: Pancreatic hepatoid carcinoma with liver metastasis INTERVENTIONS:: The patient was treated by neoadjuvant modified-FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) chemotherapy and subsequent resection of both the primary pancreatic tumor and the sole liver metastasis.OUTCOMES: Pathology findings confirmed complete pathological response of the liver metastatic tumor and partial response of the primary pancreatic tumor to neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX. Adjuvant chemotherapy with mFOLFIRINOX was given and until now the patient has a progression-free survival of 13 months after diagnosis.LESSONS: PHC are often associated with early liver metastasis and a poor prognosis, surgical resection combined with neoadjuvant and adjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy is proved to be efficient in such kind of malignancy, even with liver metastasis. labels: #Aged#Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Humans#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Neoadjuvant Therapy#Neoplasms, Multiple Primary#Pancreatectomy#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Splenectomy#Treatment Outcome'
b'The risk calculator of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) has been shown to be useful in predicting postoperative complications. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the ACS-NSQIP calculator in geriatric patients undergoing lumbar surgery.A total of 242 geriatric patients who underwent lumbar surgery between January 2014 and December 2016 were included. Preoperative clinical information was retrospectively reviewed and entered into the ACS-NSQIP calculator. The predictive value of the ACS-NSQIP model was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, Brier score (B), and receiver operating characteristics (ROC, also referred C-statistic) curve analysis. Additional risk factors were calculated as surgeon-adjusted risk including previous cardiac event and cerebrovascular disease.Preoperative risk factors including age (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.004), functional independence (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0), American Society of Anesthesiologists class (ASA class, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0), dyspnea (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0), dialysis (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.049), previous cardiac event (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001), and history of cerebrovascular disease (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0) were significantly associated with a greater incidence of postoperative complications. Observed and predicted incidence of postoperative complications was 43.8% and 13.7% (\xc2\xb15.9%) (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01), respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrated adequate predictive accuracy of the ACS-NSQIP model for all complications. However, Brier score showed that the ACS-NSQIP model could not accurately predict risk of all (B\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.321) or serious (B\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.241) complications, although it accurately predicted the risk of death (B\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.0072); this was supported by ROC curve analysis. The ROC curve also showed that the model had high sensitivity and specificity for predicting renal failure and readmission.The ACS-NSQIP surgical risk calculator is not an accurate tool for the prediction of postoperative complications in geriatric Chinese patients undergoing lumbar surgery. labels: #Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Female#Geriatric Assessment#Humans#Incidence#Laminectomy#Lumbar Vertebrae#Male#Middle Aged#Postoperative Complications#Predictive Value of Tests#ROC Curve#Retrospective Studies#Risk Assessment#Risk Factors#Sensitivity and Specificity#Spinal Stenosis'
b'RATIONALE: Hypoglycemic encephalopathy is a metabolic encephalopathy. Clinical risk is mixed with acute cerebrovascular disease, so it is critical to identify and make the correct diagnosis of the disease as early as possible.PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report a case of a 51-year-old male patient with hypoglycemic encephalopathy, who presented confusion and unconsciousness for 1 day.DIAGNOSES: In addition to blood-related indicators and medical histories, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), can be valuable to the diagnosis of hypoglycemic encephalopathy, which showed diffuse high-signal intensity in the cerebral cortex, and also the hippocampus, head of the caudate nucleus, the lentiform nucleus, and corpus callosum.INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous glucose injection and drip was performed repeatedly. The blood glucose levels were gradually corrected, and the resulting blood glucose was 6.5\xe2\x80\x8ammol/L.OUTCOMES: The prognosis depends on the degree of hypoglycemia, duration, and condition of the organism. Due to the long duration of hypoglycemia, unfortunately, the patient died.LESSONS: It is critical to diagnose hypoglycemic encephalopathy as early as possible. MRI reveals diffuse abnormal intensity in the cortex and basal ganglia region.

b'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diarrhea is a common complication of enteral nutrition (EN), which affects recovery and prolongs the length of hospital stay (LOHS). To investigate the effect of fiber and probiotics in reducing diarrhea associated with EN in postoperative patients with gastric cancer (GC), the authors designed this prospective randomized-controlled trial.METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This study included 120 patients with GC, and the patients were classified into 3 groups via random picking of envelopes: fiber-free nutrition formula (FF group, n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a40), fiber-enriched nutrition formula (FE group, n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a40), and fiber- and probiotic-enriched nutrition formula (FEP group, n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a40). All patients were given EN formulas for 7 consecutive days after surgery.RESULTS: The number of diarrhea cases was higher in the FF group than in the FE group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.007). The FEP group had a lower number of diarrhea cases compared with the FE group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.003). Patients in the FE group had a significantly shorter first flatus time than the FF group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.002). However, no significant difference was observed between the FE group and FEP group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.30). Intestinal disorders were similar between the FE group and FF group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.38). The FEP group had a lower number of intestinal disorder cases than the FF group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.03). LOHS in the FE and FEP groups was shorter than that in the FF group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.004; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the FE and FEP groups (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.28). In addition, no significant difference was observed between the 3 groups in terms of total lymphocyte count, albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin levels on day 7 of enteral feeding.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of fiber and probiotics was significantly effective in treating diarrhea that is associated with EN in postoperative patients with GC. labels: #Aged#Diarrhea#Dietary Fiber#Enteral Nutrition#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Postoperative Period#Probiotics#Prospective Studies#Stomach Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome'
b"Local anesthesia is routinely recommended for percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). However, the intense intraoperative pain remains a serious problem. The purpose of the current study is to find a safe and effective method to alleviate the intense pain during PTED for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) under local anesthesia.This study retrospectively analyzed 63 LDH patients who accepted PTED under local anesthesia. Thirty-one patients received intramuscular injection of morphine before PTED, while the other 32 were not. The 10 points visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the patients' maximum leg and back pain. Patients were asked to grade their experiences of surgery and anesthesia on a 5-point Likert-type scale after the surgery. Modified Mac Nab Criteria were used to evaluate the surgical outcomes after 3-month follow-up.The intraoperative VAS scores of patients who accepted preoperative intervention decreased significantly. The postoperative VAS scores of both groups showed no significance. Patients who received preoperative intervention reported a higher subjective satisfaction rate with the surgery experience. According to the Modified Mac Nab criteria, the surgical outcomes of both groups were similar through the 3-month follow-up. After injection of morphine, 4 patients complained nausea and 2 patients experienced vomiting.Preoperative intramuscular injection of morphine could reduce the patients' pain during the PTED surgery and improve the patients' satisfaction without affecting the surgical outcome. Except for a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting, this method is relatively safe and convenient. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Analgesics, Opioid#Anesthesia, Local#Diskectomy, Percutaneous#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Injections, Intramuscular#Intervertebral Disc Displacement#Intraoperative Complications#Lumbar Vertebrae#Male#Middle Aged#Morphine#Pain#Patient Satisfaction#Preoperative Care#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Visual Analog Scale#Young Adult"
b'In acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), right ventricular pressure overload impairs right-sided cardiac conduction and repolarization. We hypothesized that if heterogeneity of repolarization between right and left ventricles occurs in acute PTE, there would be the difference of repolarization between them. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of corrected QT interval (QTc) difference between leads V1 and V6 (V1\xe2\x80\x8a-\xe2\x80\x8aV6) in patients with acute PTE.A total of 89 patients with suspected acute PTE who underwent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) were enrolled from January to December 2015. PTE was identified by CTA. We compared electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters, especially QTc difference (V1\xe2\x80\x8a-\xe2\x80\x8aV6) between patients with PTE and those without PTE.Acute PTE was finally diagnosed in 45 patients. Clinical situations including the chief complaint were not different between PTE and non-PTE groups. S1Q3T3, a traditional ECG marker, had no diagnostic value for acute PTE. Patients with PTE had a significantly longer mean QTc in V1 (454.6\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a44.3 vs 417.5\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a31.3\xe2\x80\x8ams, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and larger QTc difference (V1\xe2\x80\x8a-\xe2\x80\x8aV6) (34.8\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a30.5 vs -12.5\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a16.6\xe2\x80\x8ams, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) than non-PTE controls. QTc difference (V1\xe2\x80\x8a-\xe2\x80\x8aV6) was negative in all patients without PTE. PTE patients had a higher prevalence of T wave inversion in leads III (51.1% vs 29.5%, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.038) and V1 (82.2% vs 38.6%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). A QTc difference (V1\xe2\x80\x8a-\xe2\x80\x8aV6) of \xe2\x89\xa520\xe2\x80\x8ams identified PTE with 82.2% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 100.0% positive predictive value.QTc difference (V1\xe2\x80\x8a-\xe2\x80\x8aV6) had an excellent diagnostic value for differentiating patients with and without acute PTE. labels: #Acute Disease#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Arrhythmias, Cardiac#Electrocardiography#Female#Heart Conduction System#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Predictive Value of Tests#Pulmonary Embolism#Retrospective Studies#Sensitivity and Specificity'
b'RATIONALE: The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP1) is the most frequent site of gouty tophi. We report an unusual case with a giant skin-perforating tophi. This is the first case of gouty tophi at MTP1 which accepts surgical debulking and amputation.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old man presented with a seven-year history of gout and a giant tophi at MTP1. The patient was referred to hospital due to persistent pain and ulcerations on the surface of the left MTP1. This rounded, giant, swelling, tophaceous tophi severely interfered with his normal walking.DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with gouty arthritis seven years ago, and did not receive regular anti-gout treatments.OUTCOMES: Biochemical examination showed he had raised serum uric acid (SUA, 11.92\xe2\x80\x8amg/dl) and creatinine (258\xe2\x80\x8a\xce\xbcmol/l). There was a severe joint destruction of MTP1 by X-ray examination. We controlled the skin infection by sulbenicillin. He was given febuxostat to reduce SUA. After 3 months of treatment, SUA fell to 6.8\xe2\x80\x8amg/dl. Then we performed surgical debulking of MTP1 and amputation of hallux. Surgical operations obviously relieved the pain, and improved the function of his left foot. The visual closure after amputation was good.CONCLUSION: Surgical amputation of the gout lesion at MTP1 maximized the function, and reduced the pain of this patient. In the case of giant tophi with severe gouty arthritis or skin infections, surgical decisions need to weigh gains and losses carefully. labels: #Adult#Amputation#Arthritis, Gouty#Creatinine#Humans#Male#Metatarsophalangeal Joint#Uric Acid'
b"This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 3 surgical procedures for Spontaneous Supratentorial Intracerebral Hemorrhage (SICH).A total of 63 patients with SICH were randomized into 3 groups. Group A (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a21) underwent craniotomy surgery, group B (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a22) underwent burr hole, urokinase infusion and catheter drainage, and group C (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a20) underwent neuroendoscopic surgery. The hematoma evacuation rate of the operation was analyzed by 3D Slice software and the average surgery time, visualization during operation, decompressive effect, mortality, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) improvement, complications include rebleeding, pneumonia, intracranial infection were also compared among 3 groups.All procedures were successfully completed and the hematoma evacuation rate was significant differences among 3 groups which were 79.8%, 43.1%, 89.3% respectively (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01), and group C was the highest group. Group B was smallest traumatic one and shared the shortest operation time, but for the lack of hemostasis, it also the highest rebleeding group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.03). Although there were different in complications, but there was no significant in pneumonia, intracranial infection, GCS improvement and mortality rate.All these 3 methods had its own advantages and shortcomings, and every approach had its indications for SICH. Although for neuroendoscopic technical's minimal invasive, direct vision, effectively hematoma evacuation rate, and the relatively optimistic result, it might be a more promising approach for SICH. labels: #Adult#Aged#Cerebral Hemorrhage#Craniotomy#Drainage#Female#Glasgow Coma Scale#Hematoma#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neuroendoscopy#Operative Time#Random Allocation#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'The predictive factors associated with neck pain remain unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess predictive factors, especially Modic changes (MCs), associated with the intensity and duration of neck pain in patients with cervical disc degenerative disease.We retrospectively reviewed patients in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2016. Severe neck pain (SNP) and persistent neck pain (PNP) were the 2 main outcomes, and were assessed based on the numerical rating scale (NRS). Basic data, and also imaging data, were collected and analyzed as potential predictive factors. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the predictive factors for neck pain.In all, 381 patients (193 males and 188 females) with cervical degenerative disease were included in our study. The number of patients with SNP and PNP were 94 (24.67%) and 109 (28.61%), respectively. The NRS of neck pain in patients with type 1 MCs was significantly higher than type 2 MCs (4.8\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.9 vs 3.9\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a1.1; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.004). The multivariate logistic analysis showed that kyphosis curvature (odds ratio [OR] 1.082, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.044-1.112), spondylolisthesis (OR 1.339, 95% CI 1.226-1.462), and annular tear (OR 1.188, 95% CI 1.021-1.382) were factors associated with SNP, whereas kyphosis curvature (OR 1.568, 95% CI 1.022-2.394), spondylolisthesis (OR 1.486, 95% CI 1.082-2.041), and MCs (OR 1.152, 95% CI 1.074-1.234) were associated with PNP.We concluded that kyphosis curvature, spondylolisthesis, and annular tear are associated with SNP, whereas kyphosis curvature, spondylolisthesis, and MCs are associated with PNP. This study supports the view that MCs can lead to a long duration of neck pain. labels: #Adult#Biomechanical Phenomena#Cervical Vertebrae#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intervertebral Disc Degeneration#Kyphosis#Logistic Models#Lordosis#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Neck Pain#Pain Measurement#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Spinal Diseases#Spondylolisthesis'
b"RATIONALE: Glucagonoma and pancreatic serous oligocystic adenoma (SOA) are rare neuroendocrine and exocrine tumors of the pancreas, respectively. The coexistence of glucagonoma syndrome (GS) and SOA is a rare clinical condition and has not yet been reported. Additionally, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), a hallmark clinical sign of GS, is often misdiagnosed as other skin lesions by clinicians due to their lack of related knowledge, which delays diagnosis of GS and thus exacerbates the prognosis.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to our department because he presented with diabetes mellitus and a recurrent ulcerated skin rash. Prior to the accurate diagnosis, the skin manifestation was considered to be diabetic dermopathy.DIAGNOSES: The patient's fasting serum glucagon level was up to 871.5\xe2\x80\x8apg/mL. A biopsy of the pancreatic tumor revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and immunoperoxidase staining revealed glucagon-positive cells. In addition, the histological examination of the pancreatic cystic lesions showed typical features of SOA.INTERVENTIONS: The patient received a pancreaticoduodenal resection and radiofrequency ablation for the hepatic nodular lesion.OUTCOMES: One week after surgery, the glucagon concentration decreased to near normal levels. The cutaneous lesions spontaneously resolved within 4 weeks after surgery.LESSONS: Because almost all glucagonomas are malignant or have malignant potential, their early recognition and correct diagnosis are very important for a better prognosis, especially in cases with NME as the only manifestation during the development of glucagonomas. It is therefore imperative that clinicians recognize NME early to make an accurate diagnosis. labels: #Cystadenoma, Serous#Diabetes Complications#Diabetes Mellitus#Exanthema#Glucagonoma#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Necrolytic Migratory Erythema#Pancreatic Neoplasms"
b'BACKGROUND: Stunting is the most prevalent manifestation of childhood malnutrition. To characterize factors that contribute to stunting in resource-poor settings, we studied a priori selected biological and social factors collected longitudinally in a cohort of newborns.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 1,868 children across 7 resource-poor settings in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania shortly after birth and followed them for 24 months between 2 November 2009 and 28 February 2014. We collected longitudinal anthropometry, sociodemographic factors, maternal-reported illnesses, and antibiotic use; child feeding practices; dietary intake starting at 9 months; and longitudinal blood, urine, and stool samples to investigate non-diarrheal enteropathogens, micronutrients, gut inflammation and permeability, and systemic inflammation. We categorized length-for-age Z-scores into 3 groups (not stunted, \xe2\x89\xa5-1; at risk,<-1 to -2; and stunted,<-2), and used multivariable ordinal logistic regression to model the cumulative odds of being in a lower length-for-age category (at risk or stunted). A total of 1,197 children with complete longitudinal data were available for analysis. The prevalence of having a length-for-age Z-score below -1 increased from 43% (range 37%-47% across sites) shortly after birth (mean 7.7 days post-delivery, range 0 to 17 days) to 74% (16%-96%) at 24 months. The prevalence of stunting increased 3-fold during this same time period. Factors that contributed to the odds of being in a lower length-for-age category at 24 months were lower enrollment weight-for-age (interquartile cumulative odds ratio = 1.82, 95% CI 1.49-2.23), shorter maternal height (2.38, 1.89-3.01), higher number of enteropathogens in non-diarrheal stools (1.36, 1.07-1.73), lower socioeconomic status (1.75, 1.20-2.55), and lower percent of energy from protein (1.39, 1.13-1.72). Site-specific analyses suggest that reported associations were similar across settings. While loss to follow-up and missing data are inevitable, some study sites had greater loss to follow-up and more missing data than others, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal and maternal factors were early determinants of lower length-for-age, and their contribution remained important throughout the first 24 months of life, whereas the average number of enteropathogens in non-diarrheal stools, socioeconomic status, and dietary intake became increasingly important contributors by 24 months relative to neonatal and maternal factors. labels: #Age Factors#Anthropometry#Bangladesh#Body Height#Brazil#Child, Preschool#Demography#Developing Countries#Eating#Environment#Female#Growth Disorders#Humans#India#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Maternal Health#Nepal#Nutrition Assessment#Peru#Risk Assessment#Risk Factors#Socioeconomic Factors#South Africa#Tanzania'
b'How neuronal diversity emerges from complex patterns of gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating pooled- and single-cell transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. Using neuroinformatics methods, we compiled a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types with paired gene expression and intrinsic electrophysiological features from publically accessible sources, the largest such collection to date. We identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 physiological parameters. We next trained statistical models to infer cellular features from multivariate gene expression patterns. Such models were predictive of gene-electrophysiological relationships in an independent collection of 12 visual cortex cell types from the Allen Institute, suggesting that these correlations might reflect general principles relating expression patterns to phenotypic diversity across very different cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like Gabrd and Scn1a (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms. Our work highlights the promise and inherent challenges in using cell type-specific transcriptomics to understand the mechanistic origins of neuronal diversity. labels: #Action Potentials#Animals#Brain#Gene Expression Profiling#Humans#Ion Channels#Membrane Potentials#Mice#Neurons#Synaptic Transmission#Transcriptome'
b'Kleefstra syndrome, caused by haploinsufficiency of euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1), is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characteristic facial dysmorphisms, and other variable clinical features. In addition to EHMT1 mutations, de novo variants were reported in four additional genes (MBD5, SMARCB1, NR1I3, and KMT2C), in single individuals with clinical characteristics overlapping Kleefstra syndrome. Here, we present a novel cohort of five patients with de novo loss of function mutations affecting the histone methyltransferase KMT2C. Our clinical data delineates the KMT2C phenotypic spectrum and reinforces the phenotypic overlap with Kleefstra syndrome and other related ID disorders. To elucidate the common molecular basis of the neuropathology associated with mutations in KMT2C and EHMT1, we characterized the role of the Drosophila KMT2C ortholog, trithorax related (trr), in the nervous system. Similar to the Drosophila EHMT1 ortholog, G9a, trr is required in the mushroom body for short term memory. Trr ChIP-seq identified 3371 binding sites, mainly in the promoter of genes involved in neuronal processes. Transcriptional profiling of pan-neuronal trr knockdown and G9a null mutant fly heads identified 613 and 1123 misregulated genes, respectively. These gene sets show a significant overlap and are associated with nearly identical gene ontology enrichments. The majority of the observed biological convergence is derived from predicted indirect target genes. However, trr and G9a also have common direct targets, including the Drosophila ortholog of Arc (Arc1), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity. Our data highlight the clinical and molecular convergence between the KMT2 and EHMT protein families, which may contribute to a molecular network underlying a larger group of ID/ASD-related disorders. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Animals#Autism Spectrum Disorder#Binding Sites#Child#Chromosome Deletion#Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9#Craniofacial Abnormalities#Cytoskeletal Proteins#DNA-Binding Proteins#Drosophila Proteins#Drosophila melanogaster#Female#Gene Expression Regulation#Haploinsufficiency#Heart Defects, Congenital#Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase#Histones#Humans#Intellectual Disability#Male#Mutation#Nerve Tissue Proteins#Neuronal Plasticity#Promoter Regions, Genetic'
b'Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate intercellular communication at synapses through the opening of an ion pore in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. Despite the increasing availability of high-resolution structures of pLGICs, a detailed understanding of the functional isomerization from closed to open (gating) and back is currently missing. Here, we provide the first atomistic description of the transition from open to closed (un-gating) in the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from Caenorhabditis Elegans. Starting with the active-state structure solved in complex with the neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ivermectin, we analyze the spontaneous relaxation of the channel upon removal of ivermectin by explicit solvent/membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The \xce\xbcs-long trajectories support the conclusion that ion-channel deactivation is mediated by two distinct quaternary transitions, i.e. a global receptor twisting followed by the radial expansion (or blooming) of the extracellular domain. At variance with previous models, we show that pore closing is exclusively regulated by the global twisting, which controls the position of the \xce\xb21-\xce\xb22 loop relative to the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM domain interface. Additional simulations with L-glutamate restrained to the crystallographic binding mode and ivermectin removed indicate that the same twisting isomerization is regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric site. These results provide a structural model for gating in pLGICs and suggest a plausible mechanism for the pharmacological action of PAMs in this neurotransmitter receptor family. The simulated un-gating converges to the X-ray structure of GluCl resting state both globally and locally, demonstrating the predictive character of state-of-art MD simulations. labels: #Allosteric Regulation#Allosteric Site#Binding Sites#Chloride Channels#Glutamic Acid#Ion Channel Gating#Ivermectin#Ligand-Gated Ion Channels#Ligands#Models, Chemical#Molecular Dynamics Simulation#Neurotransmitter Agents#Protein Binding#Protein Conformation'
b'In developing brain neuronal migration, dendrite outgrowth and dendritic spine outgrowth are controlled by Cdc42, a small GTPase of the Rho family, and its activators. Cdc42 function in promoting actin polymerization is crucial for glutamatergic synapse regulation. Here, we focus on GABAergic synapse-specific activator of Cdc42, collybistin (CB) and examine functional differences between its splice isoforms CB1 and CB2. We report that CB1 and CB2 differentially regulate GABAergic synapse formation in vitro along proximal-distal axis and adult-born neuron maturation in vivo. The functional specialization between CB1 and CB2 isoforms arises from their differential protein half-life, in turn regulated by ubiquitin conjugation of the unique CB1 C-terminus. We report that CB1 and CB2 negatively regulate Cdc42; however, Cdc42 activation is dependent on CB interaction with gephyrin. During hippocampal adult neurogenesis CB1 regulates neuronal migration, while CB2 is essential for dendrite outgrowth. Finally, using mice lacking Gabra2 subunit, we show that CB1 function is downstream of GABAARs, and we can rescue adult neurogenesis deficit observed in Gabra2 KO. Overall, our results uncover previously unexpected role for CB isoforms downstream of \xce\xb12-containing GABAARs during neuron maturation in a Cdc42 dependent mechanism. labels: #Animals#Carrier Proteins#Cell Movement#Gene Expression Regulation#HEK293 Cells#Hippocampus#Humans#Membrane Proteins#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mice, Knockout#Neurogenesis#Neurons#Protein Isoforms#Receptors, GABA-A#Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors#Synapses#cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein'
b'Heterochromatin contains a significant part of nuclear DNA. Little is known about the mechanisms that govern heterochromatic DNA stability. We show here that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (i) DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is required for the maintenance of heterochromatic DNA stability, (ii) MutL\xce\xb1 (Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer), MutS\xce\xb1 (Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer), MutS\xce\xb2 (Msh2-Msh3 heterodimer), and Exo1 are involved in MMR at heterochromatin, (iii) Exo1-independent MMR at heterochromatin frequently leads to the formation of Pol \xce\xb6-dependent mutations, (iv) MMR cooperates with the proofreading activity of Pol \xce\xb5 and the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 in the maintenance of heterochromatic DNA stability, (v) repair of base-base mismatches at heterochromatin is less efficient than repair of base-base mismatches at euchromatin, and (vi) the efficiency of repair of 1-nt insertion/deletion loops at heterochromatin is similar to the efficiency of repair of 1-nt insertion/deletion loops at euchromatin. labels: #Base Sequence#DNA Damage#DNA Mismatch Repair#DNA, Fungal#Exodeoxyribonucleases#Genes, pol#Heterochromatin#Histone Acetyltransferases#MutL Proteins#MutS DNA Mismatch-Binding Protein#Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins#Sequence Homology'
b'Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) provides the precursors for the generation of dNTPs, which are required for DNA synthesis and repair. Here, we investigated the function of the major RNR subunits Rnr1 and Rnr3 in telomere elongation in budding yeast. We show that Rnr1 is essential for the sustained elongation of short telomeres by telomerase. In the absence of Rnr1, cells harbor very short, but functional, telomeres, which cannot become elongated by increased telomerase activity or by tethering of telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rnr1 function is critical to prevent an early onset of replicative senescence and premature survivor formation in telomerase-negative cells but dispensable for telomere elongation by Homology-Directed-Repair. Our results suggest that telomerase has a "basal activity" mode that is sufficient to compensate for the "end-replication-problem" and does not require the presence of Rnr1 and a different "sustained activity" mode necessary for the elongation of short telomeres, which requires an upregulation of dNTP levels and dGTP ratios specifically through Rnr1 function. By analyzing telomere length and dNTP levels in different mutants showing changes in RNR complex composition and activity we provide evidence that the Mec1ATR checkpoint protein promotes telomere elongation by increasing both dNTP levels and dGTP ratios through Rnr1 upregulation in a mechanism that cannot be replaced by its homolog Rnr3. labels: #Cellular Senescence#DNA Replication#Ribonucleotide Reductases#Saccharomycetales#Telomerase#Telomere#Telomere Homeostasis'
b'Many microorganisms that cause systemic, life-threatening infections in humans reside as harmless commensals in our digestive tract. Yet little is known about the biology of these microbes in the gut. Here, we visualize the interface between the human commensal and pathogenic fungus Candida albicans and the intestine of mice, a surrogate host. Because the indigenous mouse microbiota restricts C. albicans settlement, we compared the patterns of colonization in the gut of germ free and antibiotic-treated conventionally raised mice. In contrast to the heterogeneous morphologies found in the latter, we establish that in germ free animals the fungus almost uniformly adopts the yeast cell form, a proxy of its commensal state. By screening a collection of C. albicans transcription regulator deletion mutants in gnotobiotic mice, we identify several genes previously unknown to contribute to in vivo fitness. We investigate three of these regulators-ZCF8, ZFU2 and TRY4-and show that indeed they favor the yeast form over other morphologies. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrate that genetically inducing non-yeast cell morphologies is detrimental to the fitness of C. albicans in the gut. Furthermore, the identified regulators promote adherence of the fungus to a surface covered with mucin and to mucus-producing intestinal epithelial cells. In agreement with this result, histology sections indicate that C. albicans dwells in the murine gut in close proximity to the mucus layer. Thus, our findings reveal a set of regulators that endows C. albicans with the ability to endure in the intestine through multiple mechanisms. labels: #Animals#Candida albicans#Candidiasis#Germ-Free Life#Host-Pathogen Interactions#Intestinal Mucosa#Life Cycle Stages#Mice#Symbiosis'
b'Objectives: Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been described, but unselected PDAs have shown limited clinical responsiveness to anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 therapy.Methods: We studied 24 cases of undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma (UPC) using immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 (E1L3N clone), CD3, CD20, CD68, and DNA mismatch repair proteins in this study. Slides were scored for extent of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells.Results: PD-L1 expression was more frequent in UPCs than in PDAs (63% vs 15%, P<.01). The extent of PD-L1 expression was greater in UPCs, with 13 (87%) of 15 cases containing 10% or more positive tumor cells compared with three of seven PDAs (P = .05). Both tumor groups showed similar numbers of tumor-infiltrating T cells, B cells, and macrophages.Conclusions: UPC is enriched for PD-L1 expression in frequency and extent, relative to conventional PDA. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents may represent a valuable therapeutic approach for this subset of highly aggressive pancreatic carcinoma. labels: #Aged#B7-H1 Antigen#Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal#Female#History, 16th Century#History, 17th Century#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating#Male#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Proportional Hazards Models'
b'Objectives: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) in submucosal invasive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SM-ESCC) is a prognostic factor. The aim of this study was to identify a histopathologic predictor of LNM in SM-ESCC.Methods: In total, 108 patients who underwent an esophagectomy and lymph node dissection without preoperative therapy and who were pathologically diagnosed with SM-ESCC were enrolled in this study. Relationships between several clinicopathologic factors and LNM were examined.Results: A multivariate analysis revealed that a tumor size of 35 mm or more (P = .0025), submucosal invasive depth (SID) of 2,000 \xce\xbcm or more (P = .013), and lymphatic infiltration (P<.0001) were significant independent predictors of LNM. In addition, there were significant differences in recurrence-free survival curves between patients with SID less than 2,000 \xce\xbcm or not (P = .029) and tumor size less than 35 mm or not (P = .049).Conclusions: This study suggests that SID may predict not only LNM but also poor prognosis. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Squamous Cell#Esophageal Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Lymphatic Metastasis#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Proportional Hazards Models'
b"Cell replacement has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to repair the brain in patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Post-mortem evaluations of healthy grafted tissue in such cases have revealed the development of Huntington- or Parkinson-like pathology including mutant huntingtin aggregates and Lewy bodies. An outstanding question remains if tau pathology can also be seen in patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease who had received foetal neural allografts. This was addressed by immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent stainings performed on grafted tissue of two Huntington's disease patients, who came to autopsy 9 and 12 years post-transplantation, and two patients with Parkinson's disease who came to autopsy 18 months and 16 years post-transplantation. We show that grafts also contain tau pathology in both types of transplanted patients. In two patients with Huntington's disease, the grafted tissue showed the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau [both AT8 (phospho-tau Ser202 and Thr205) and CP13 (pSer202) immunohistochemical stainings]pathological inclusions, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the grafted tissue was characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8; immunofluorescent staining) pathological inclusions, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads but only in the patient who came to autopsy 16 years post-transplantation. Abundant tau-related pathology was observed in the cortex and striatum of all cases studied. While the striatum of the grafted Huntington's disease patient revealed an equal amount of 3-repeat and 4-repeat isoforms of tau, the grafted tissue showed elevated 4-repeat isoforms by western blot. This suggests that transplants may have acquired tau pathology from the host brain, although another possibility is that this was due to acceleration of ageing. This finding not only adds to the recent reports that tau pathology is a feature of these neurodegenerative diseases, but also that tau pathology can manifest in healthy neural tissue transplanted into the brains of patients with two distinct neurodegenerative disorders. labels: #Adult#Aged#Allografts#Autopsy#Case-Control Studies#Child#Female#Fetal Tissue Transplantation#Humans#Huntington Disease#Male#Middle Aged#Neostriatum#Parkinson Disease#Protein Aggregation, Pathological#tau Proteins"
b'BACKGROUND: Detailed neuropathological information on the structural brain lesions underlying seizures is valuable for understanding drug-resistant focal epilepsy.METHODS: We report the diagnoses made on the basis of resected brain specimens from 9523 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant seizures in 36 centers from 12 European countries over 25 years. Histopathological diagnoses were determined through examination of the specimens in local hospitals (41%) or at the German Neuropathology Reference Center for Epilepsy Surgery (59%).RESULTS: The onset of seizures occurred before 18 years of age in 75.9% of patients overall, and 72.5% of the patients underwent surgery as adults. The mean duration of epilepsy before surgical resection was 20.1 years among adults and 5.3 years among children. The temporal lobe was involved in 71.9% of operations. There were 36 histopathological diagnoses in seven major disease categories. The most common categories were hippocampal sclerosis, found in 36.4% of the patients (88.7% of cases were in adults), tumors (mainly ganglioglioma) in 23.6%, and malformations of cortical development in 19.8% (focal cortical dysplasia was the most common type, 52.7% of cases of which were in children). No histopathological diagnosis could be established for 7.7% of the patients.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy requiring surgery, hippocampal sclerosis was the most common histopathological diagnosis among adults, and focal cortical dysplasia was the most common diagnosis among children. Tumors were the second most common lesion in both groups.

b'BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical treatment may improve seizures in children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy, but additional data are needed from randomized trials.METHODS: In this single-center trial, we randomly assigned 116 patients who were 18 years of age or younger with drug-resistant epilepsy to undergo brain surgery appropriate to the underlying cause of epilepsy along with appropriate medical therapy (surgery group, 57 patients) or to receive medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group, 59 patients). The patients in the medical-therapy group were assigned to a waiting list for surgery. The primary outcome was freedom from seizures at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Hague Seizure Severity scale, the Binet-Kamat intelligence quotient, the social quotient on the Vineland Social Maturity Scale, and scores on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.RESULTS: At 12 months, freedom from seizures occurred in 44 patients (77%) in the surgery group and in 4 (7%) in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001). Between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months significantly favored surgery with respect to the score on the Hague Seizure Severity scale (difference, 19.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8 to 23.1; P<0.001), on the Child Behavior Checklist (difference, 13.1; 95% CI, 10.7 to 15.6; P<0.001), on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (difference, 21.9; 95% CI, 16.4 to 27.6; P<0.001), and on the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (difference, 4.7; 95% CI, 0.4 to 9.1; P=0.03), but not on the Binet-Kamat intelligence quotient (difference, 2.5; 95% CI, -0.1 to 5.1; P=0.06). Serious adverse events occurred in 19 patients (33%) in the surgery group, including hemiparesis in 15 (26%).CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center trial, children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy who had undergone epilepsy surgery had a significantly higher rate of freedom from seizures and better scores with respect to behavior and quality of life than did those who continued medical therapy alone at 12 months.

b'BACKGROUND: Chromosomal rearrangements involving 17q23 have been described rarely. Deletions at 17q23.1q23.2 have been reported in individuals with developmental delay and growth retardation, whereas duplications at 17q23.1q23.2 appear to segregate with clubfoot. Dosage alterations in the TBX2 and TBX4 genes, located in 17q23.2, have been proposed to be responsible for the phenotypes observed in individuals with 17q23.1q23.2 deletions and duplications. In this report, we present the clinical phenotype of a child with a previously unreported de novo duplication at 17q23.2q23.3 located distal to the TBX2 and TBX4 region.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 7.5-year-old boy with speech and language disorder, learning difficulties, incoordination, fine motor skill impairment, infrequent seizures with abnormal EEG, and behavior disturbances (mild self-inflicted injuries, hyperactivity-inattention, and stereotyped hand movements). Chromosomal microarray revealed a 2-Mb duplication of chromosome 17q23.2q23.3. Both parents did not have the duplication indicating that this duplication is de novo in the child.CONCLUSIONS: The duplicated region encompasses 16 genes. It is possible that increased dosage of one or more genes in this region is responsible for the observed phenotype. The TANC2 gene is one of the genes in the duplicated region.It encodes a member of the TANC (tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing) family which includes TANC1 and TANC2. These proteins are highly expressed in brain and play major roles in synapsis regulation. Hence, it is suggestive that TANC2 is the likely candidate gene responsible for the observed phenotype as an increased TANC2 dosage can potentially alter synapsis, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and the neurobehavioral phenotype observed in this child with 17q23.2q23.3 duplication. labels: #Ataxia#Child#Chromosome Duplication#Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17#Developmental Disabilities#Electroencephalography#Gene Dosage#Gene Expression#Humans#Learning Disorders#Male#Phenotype#Proteins#Psychomotor Disorders#Seizures#Self-Injurious Behavior#Speech Disorders'
b'BACKGROUND: Rumex crispus root has traditionally been used in Asian medicine for the treatment of hemorrhage and dermatolosis. The aim of this study was to explore the pharmaceutical effects of water extract of Rumex crispus (WERC) on osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. We also studied the effect of WERC on the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced trabecular bone destruction mice model.METHODS: High performance liquid chromatography analysis was used to identify three compounds (emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion) of WERC. The in vivo effect of WERC was examined using an administration of WERC or vehicle on the ICR mice with bone loss induced by intraperitoneal RANKL injection on day 0 and 1. All mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at day 7 and the femurs of mice were isolated for soft X-ray and Micro-CT analysis. The in vitro effect of WERC on osteoblast mineralization or osteoclast differentiation was examined by alizarin red S staining or by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and assay. To determine the transcription level of osteoblast or osteoclast-specific genes, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used. Western blot analysis was performed to study the effect of WERC on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) or nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB (NF-\xce\xbaB) signaling molecules.RESULTS: The presence of three compounds in WERC was determined. WERC significantly suppressed RANKL-induced trabecular bone loss by preventing microstructural deterioration. In vitro, WERC increased osteoblast mineralization by enhancing the transcription of runt-related transcription factor 2 and its transcriptional coactivators, and by stimulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, WERC significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation by suppressing the activation of the RANKL signalings (MAPK and NF-\xce\xbaB) and the increasing inhibitory factors of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1.CONCLUSION: This study showed that WERC could protect against osteoporosis and suggested that the possible mechanism of WERC might be related to increased osteoblast differentiation by activating Runx2 signaling and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by suppression of RANKL signaling. labels: #Animals#Bone Resorption#Calcification, Physiologic#Cell Differentiation#Male#Mice#Mice, Inbred ICR#NFATC Transcription Factors#Osteoblasts#Osteoclasts#Osteogenesis#Plant Extracts#Rumex'
b'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Guideline recommendations for the same clinical condition may vary. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of agreement among comparable asthma and bronchiolitis treatment recommendations from guidelines.METHODS: National and international guidelines were searched by using guideline databases (eg, National Guidelines Clearinghouse: December 16-17, 2014, and January 9, 2015). Guideline recommendations were categorized as (1) recommend, (2) optionally recommend, (3) abstain from recommending, (4) recommend against a treatment, and (5) not addressed by the guideline. The degree of agreement between recommendations was evaluated by using an unweighted and weighted \xce\xba score. Pairwise comparisons of the guidelines were evaluated similarly.RESULTS: There were 7 guidelines for asthma and 4 guidelines for bronchiolitis. For asthma, there were 166 recommendation topics, with 69 recommendation topics given in \xe2\x89\xa52 guidelines. For bronchiolitis, there were 46 recommendation topics, with 21 recommendation topics provided in \xe2\x89\xa52 guidelines. The overall \xce\xba for asthma was 0.03, both unweighted (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.01 to 0.07) and weighted (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.10); for bronchiolitis, it was 0.32 unweighted (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.52) and 0.15 weighted (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.5).CONCLUSIONS: Less agreement was found in national and international guidelines for asthma than for bronchiolitis. Additional studies are needed to determine if differences are based on patient preferences and values and economic considerations or if other recommendation-level, guideline-level, and condition-level factors are driving these differences. labels: #Asthma#Bronchiolitis#Databases, Factual#Humans#Internationality#Practice Guidelines as Topic'
b'FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7) is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates the degradation of various oncoproteins in several malignancies. However, limited information is available regarding FBXW7 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the clinical significance of FBXW7 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma. The FBXW7 expression patterns in oral squamous cell carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues from 15 patients who underwent radical resection were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed using paraffin-embedded sections from biopsy specimens obtained from 110 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who underwent surgery after 5 fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy. The associations of FBXW7 expression with various clinicopathological features and prognosis were evaluated in these patients. As a results, in the 15 matched samples, the FBXW7 expression was significantly decreased in the oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared to that in the adjacent normal tissues. In the clinicopathological analysis, compared to high protein expression, low FBXW7 expression was found to significantly associate with a poor histological response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that low FBXW7 expression was significantly associated with a poor prognosis, and FBXW7 expression was found to be an independent predictor of overall survival in the multivariate analysis. Our results suggest that FBXW7 may function as a tumor suppressor protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, FBXW7 could be a potential biomarker for predicting not only the clinical response to chemoradiotherapy but also overall survival in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Squamous Cell#Cell Cycle Proteins#Cell Proliferation#Drug Resistance, Neoplasm#F-Box Proteins#F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7#Female#Fluorouracil#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Male#Middle Aged#Mouth Neoplasms#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases'
b'Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. The lifestyle, food habits, and customary practices manifest the Northeast Indian population toward higher susceptibility to develop head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we have investigated the association of smoke and smokeless tobacco, and alcohol with copy number variation of cell-free mitochondrial DNA and cell-free nuclear DNA in cases and controls. Cell-free DNA from plasma was isolated from 50 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases and 50 controls with informed written consent using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was done for copy number variation in cell-free mitochondrial DNA and cell-free nuclear DNA. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic application between the two study groups using clinicopathological parameters. The levels of cell-free nuclear DNA and cell-free mitochondrial DNA of cases in association with smoke and smokeless tobacco, alcohol with smoking (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) were significantly higher (p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.01 and p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001, respectively) than controls. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases and controls, we distinguished cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cutoff: 19.84 raw Ct; sensitivity: 84%; specificity: 100%; p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001) and cell-free nuclear DNA (cutoff: 463,282\xe2\x80\x89genomic equivalent/mL; sensitivity: 53%; specificity: 87%; p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001).

b'A repertoire of monoclonal antibodies was generated by immunization of mice with cancer-associated glycoprotein CA19.9, and two of them were selected as optimal capture and detecting counterparts for sandwich test system for detection of CA19.9. Fine epitope specificity of the antibodies was determined using printed glycan array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and inhibitory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Unexpectedly, both immunoglobulins did not bind key epitope of CA19.9 glycoprotein, tetrasaccharide SiaLeA, as well as its defucosylated form sialyl LeC(known as CA-50 epitope). The antibodies were found to have different glycan-binding profiles; however, they recognized similar glycotopes with common motif Gal\xce\xb21-3GlcNAc\xce\xb2 (LeC), thus resembling specificity of human natural cancer-associated anti-LeCantibodies.

b'Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that miR-144 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. We have shown that miR-144, injected intravenously, is taken up by the liver and induces endogenous hepatic synthesis of miR-144. We hypothesized that administered miR-144 has tumor-suppressive effects on liver tumor development in vivo. The effects of miR-144 on tumorigenesis and tumor growth were tested in a diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model. MiR-144 injection had no effect on body weight but significantly reduced diethylnitrosamine-induced liver enlargement compared with scrambled microRNA. MiR-144 had no effect on diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumor number but reduced the tumor size above 50%, as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (scrambled microRNA 23.07\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.67 vs miR-144 10.38\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.62, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05) and histological analysis (scrambled microRNA 30.75\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x895.41 vs miR-144 15.20\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x893.41, p\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.05).

Mechanistic studies showed that miR-144 targets epidermal growth factor receptor and inhibits the downstream Src/AKT signaling pathway which has previously been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis.

b'Protein structural changes induced by external perturbations or internal cues can profoundly influence protein activity and thus modulate cellular physiology. A number of biophysical approaches are available to probe protein structural changes, but these are not applicable to a whole proteome in a biological extract. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a recently developed proteomics approach that enables the identification of protein structural changes directly in their complex biological context on a proteome-wide scale. After perturbations of interest, proteome extracts are subjected to a double-protease digestion step with a nonspecific protease applied under native conditions, followed by complete digestion with the sequence-specific protease trypsin under denaturing conditions. This sequential treatment generates structure-specific peptides amenable to bottom-up MS analysis. Next, a proteomics workflow involving shotgun or targeted MS and label-free quantification is applied to measure structure-dependent proteolytic patterns directly in the proteome extract. Possible applications of LiP-MS include discovery of perturbation-induced protein structural alterations, identification of drug targets, detection of disease-associated protein structural states, and analysis of protein aggregates directly in biological samples. The approach also enables identification of the specific protein regions involved in the structural transition or affected by the binding event. Sample preparation takes approximately 2 d, followed by one to several days of MS and data analysis time, depending on the number of samples analyzed. Scientists with basic biochemistry training can implement the sample preparation steps. MS measurement and data analysis require a background in proteomics. labels: #Biomarkers#Complex Mixtures#Drug Design#Endopeptidase K#Ficain#HeLa Cells#Humans#Pronase#Protein Structure, Secondary#Protein Structure, Tertiary#Proteolysis#Proteome#Proteomics#Quality Control#Saccharomyces cerevisiae#Tandem Mass Spectrometry#Thermolysin#Trypsin'
b"The adoption of and opportunities in continuous flow synthesis ('flow chemistry') have increased significantly over the past several years. Continuous flow systems provide improved reaction safety and accelerated reaction kinetics, and have synthesised several active pharmaceutical ingredients in automated reconfigurable systems. Although continuous flow platforms are commercially available, systems constructed 'in-lab' provide researchers with a flexible, versatile, and cost-effective alternative. Herein, we describe the assembly and use of a modular continuous flow apparatus from readily available and affordable parts in as little as 30 min. Once assembled, the synthesis of a sulfonamide by reacting 4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride with dibenzylamine in a single reactor coil with an in-line quench is presented. This example reaction offers the opportunity to learn several important skills including reactor construction, charging of a back-pressure regulator, assembly of stainless-steel syringes, assembly of a continuous flow system with multiple junctions, and yield determination. From our extensive experience of single-step and multistep continuous flow synthesis, we also describe solutions to commonly encountered technical problems such as precipitation of solids ('clogging') and reactor failure. Following this protocol, a nonspecialist can assemble a continuous flow system from reactor coils, syringes, pumps, in-line liquid-liquid separators, drying columns, back-pressure regulators, static mixers, and packed-bed reactors. labels: #Benzylamines#Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic#Chlorobenzenes#Kinetics#Rheology#Sulfonamides"
b'Glycobiology, in particular the study of carbohydrate-protein interactions and the events that follow, has become an important research focus in recent decades. To study these interactions, many assays require homogeneous glycoconjugates in suitable amounts. Their synthesis is one of the methodological challenges of glycobiology. Here, we describe a versatile, three-stage protocol for the formation of glycoconjugates from unprotected carbohydrates, including those purified from natural sources, as exemplified here by rhizobial Nod factors and exopolysaccharide fragments. The first stage is to add an oligo(ethylene glycol) linker (OEG-linker) that has a terminal triphenylmethanethiol group to the reducing end of the oligosaccharide by oxime formation catalyzed by aniline. The triphenylmethyl (trityl) tag is then removed from the linker to expose a thiol (stage 2) to allow a conjugation reaction at the thiol group (stage 3). There are many possible conjugation reactions, depending on the desired application. Examples shown in this protocol are as follows: (i) coupling of the oligosaccharide to a support for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies, (ii) fluorescence labeling for microscale thermophoresis (MST) or bioimaging, and (iii) biotinylation for biolayer interferometry (BLI) studies. This protocol starts from unprotected carbohydrates and provides glycoconjugates in milligram amounts in just 2 d. labels: #Aniline Compounds#Biotinylation#Catalysis#Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic#Glycoconjugates#Glycomics#Interferometry#Lipopolysaccharides#Optical Imaging#Oximes#Polyethylene Glycols#Protein Binding#Sulfhydryl Compounds#Surface Plasmon Resonance#Trityl Compounds'
b'Importance: Robotic rectal cancer surgery is gaining popularity, but limited data are available regarding safety and efficacy.Objective: To compare robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery for risk of conversion to open laparotomy among patients undergoing resection for rectal cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial comparing robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery among 471 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for curative resection conducted at 29 sites across 10 countries, including 40 surgeons. Recruitment of patients was from January 7, 2011, to September 30, 2014, follow-up was conducted at 30 days and 6 months, and final follow-up was on June 16, 2015.Interventions: Patients were randomized to robotic-assisted (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89237) or conventional (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89234) laparoscopic rectal cancer resection, performed by either high (upper rectum) or low (total rectum) anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection (rectum and perineum).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was conversion to open laparotomy. Secondary end points included intraoperative and postoperative complications, circumferential resection margin positivity (CRM+) and other pathological outcomes, quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), bladder and sexual dysfunction (International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function, and Female Sexual Function Index), and oncological outcomes.Results: Among 471 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.0]years; 320 [67.9%] men), 466 (98.9%) completed the study. The overall rate of conversion to open laparotomy was 10.1%: 19 of 236 patients (8.1%) in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group and 28 of 230 patients (12.2%) in the conventional laparoscopic group (unadjusted risk difference\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894.1% [95% CI, -1.4% to 9.6%]; adjusted odds ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.61 [95% CI, 0.31 to 1.21]; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.16). The overall CRM+ rate was 5.7%; CRM+ occurred in 14 (6.3%) of 224 patients in the conventional laparoscopic group and 12 (5.1%) of 235 patients in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group (unadjusted risk difference\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.1% [95% CI, -3.1% to 5.4%]; adjusted odds ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.78 [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.76]; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.56). Of the other 8 reported prespecified secondary end points, including intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, plane of surgery, 30-day mortality, bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction, none showed a statistically significant difference between groups.Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for curative resection, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, as compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, did not significantly reduce the risk of conversion to open laparotomy. These findings suggest that robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, when performed by surgeons with varying experience with robotic surgery, does not confer an advantage in rectal cancer resection.Trial Registration: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN80500123. labels: #Aged#Conversion to Open Surgery#Digestive System Surgical Procedures#Direct Service Costs#Female#Humans#Laparoscopy#Laparotomy#Male#Middle Aged#Postoperative Complications#Rectal Neoplasms#Risk#Robotic Surgical Procedures'
b'Importance: Use of robotic surgery has increased in urological practice over the last decade. However, the use, outcomes, and costs of robotic nephrectomy are unknown.Objectives: To examine the trend in use of robotic-assisted operations for radical nephrectomy in the United States and to compare the perioperative outcomes and costs with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used the Premier Healthcare database to evaluate outcomes of patients who had undergone robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for renal mass at 416 US hospitals between January 2003 and September 2015. Multivariable regression modeling was used to assess outcomes.Exposures: Robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of the study was the trend in use of robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. The secondary outcomes were perioperative complications, based on the Clavien classification system, and defined as any complication (Clavien grades 1-5) or major complications (Clavien grades 3-5, for which grade 5 results in death); resource use (operating time, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay); and direct hospital cost.Results: Among 23\xe2\x80\xaf753 patients included in the study (mean age, 61.4 years; men, 13\xe2\x80\xaf792 [58.1%]), 18\xe2\x80\xaf573 underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and 5180 underwent robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. Use of robotic-assisted surgery increased from 1.5% (39 of 2676 radical nephrectomy procedures in 2003) to 27.0% (862 of 3194 radical nephrectomy procedures) in 2015 (P for trend<.001). In the weighted-adjusted analysis, there were no significant differences between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the incidence of any (Clavien grades 1-5) postoperative complications (adjusted rates, 22.2% vs 23.4%, difference, -1.2%; 95% CI, -5.4 to 3.0%) or major (Clavien grades 3-5) complications (adjusted rates, 3.5% vs 3.8%, difference, -0.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 0.5%). The rate of prolonged operating time (>4 hours) for patients undergoing the robotic-assisted procedure was higher than for patients receiving the laparoscopic procedure in the adjusted analysis (46.3% vs 25.8%; risk difference, 20.5%; 95% CI, 14.2% to 26.8%). Robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy was associated with higher mean 90-day direct hospital costs ($19\xe2\x80\xaf530 vs $16\xe2\x80\xaf851; difference, $2678; 95% CI, $838 to $4519), mainly accounted for operating room ($7217 vs $5378; difference, $1839; 95% CI, $1050 to $2628) and supply costs ($4876 vs $3891; difference, $985; 95% CI, $473 to $1498).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for renal mass between 2003 and 2015, the use of robotic-assisted surgery increased substantially. The use of robotic-assistance was not associated with increased risk of any or major complications but was associated with prolonged operating time and higher hospital costs compared with laparoscopic surgery. labels: #Aged#Female#Hospital Costs#Humans#Kidney Diseases#Laparoscopy#Logistic Models#Male#Middle Aged#Nephrectomy#Operative Time#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies#Robotic Surgical Procedures#United States'
b'Importance: Prehospital blood product transfusion in trauma care remains controversial due to poor-quality evidence and cost. Sequential expansion of blood transfusion capability after 2012 to deployed military medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) units enabled a concurrent cohort study to focus on the timing as well as the location of the initial transfusion.Objective: To examine the association of prehospital transfusion and time to initial transfusion with injury survival.Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of US military combat casualties in Afghanistan between April 1, 2012, and August 7, 2015. Eligible patients were rescued alive by MEDEVAC from point of injury with either (1) a traumatic limb amputation at or above the knee or elbow or (2) shock defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute.Exposures: Initiation of prehospital transfusion and time from MEDEVAC rescue to first transfusion, regardless of location (ie, prior to or during hospitalization). Transfusion recipients were compared with nonrecipients (unexposed) for whom transfusion was delayed or not given.Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality at 24 hours and 30 days after MEDEVAC rescue were coprimary outcomes. To balance injury severity, nonrecipients of prehospital transfusion were frequency matched to recipients by mechanism of injury, prehospital shock, severity of limb amputation, head injury, and torso hemorrhage. Cox regression was stratified by matched groups and also adjusted for age, injury year, transport team, tourniquet use, and time to MEDEVAC rescue.Results: Of 502 patients (median age, 25 years [interquartile range, 22 to 29 years]; 98% male), 3 of 55 prehospital transfusion recipients (5%) and 85 of 447 nonrecipients (19%) died within 24 hours of MEDEVAC rescue (between-group difference, -14% [95% CI, -21% to -6%]; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.01). By day 30, 6 recipients (11%) and 102 nonrecipients (23%) died (between-group difference, -12% [95% CI, -21% to -2%]; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.04). For the 386 patients without missing covariate data among the 400 patients within the matched groups, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality associated with prehospital transfusion was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.84, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.02) over 24 hours (3 deaths among 54 recipients vs 67 deaths among 332 matched nonrecipients) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.92, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.03) over 30 days (6 vs 76 deaths, respectively). Time to initial transfusion, regardless of location (prehospital or during hospitalization), was associated with reduced 24-hour mortality only up to 15 minutes after MEDEVAC rescue (median, 36 minutes after injury; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.73], P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89.02; there were 2 deaths among 62 recipients vs 68 deaths among 324 delayed transfusion recipients or nonrecipients).Conclusions and Relevance: Among medically evacuated US military combat causalities in Afghanistan, blood product transfusion prehospital or within minutes of injury was associated with greater 24-hour and 30-day survival than delayed transfusion or no transfusion. The findings support prehospital transfusion in this setting. labels: #Adult#Afghan Campaign 2001-#Air Ambulances#Blood Transfusion#Emergency Medical Services#Female#Humans#Male#Military Medicine#Military Personnel#Proportional Hazards Models#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Time-to-Treatment#United States#Wounds and Injuries#Young Adult'
b"Importance: Hypothermia initiated at less than 6 hours after birth reduces death or disability for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy at 36 weeks' or later gestation. To our knowledge, hypothermia trials have not been performed in infants presenting after 6 hours.Objective: To estimate the probability that hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth reduces the risk of death or disability at 18 months among infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial was conducted between April 2008 and June 2016 among infants at 36 weeks' or later gestation with moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy enrolled at 6 to 24 hours after birth. Twenty-one US Neonatal Research Network centers participated. Bayesian analyses were prespecified given the anticipated limited sample size.Interventions: Targeted esophageal temperature was used in 168 infants. Eighty-three hypothermic infants were maintained at 33.5\xc2\xb0C (acceptable range, 33\xc2\xb0C-34\xc2\xb0C) for 96 hours and then rewarmed. Eighty-five noncooled infants were maintained at 37.0\xc2\xb0C (acceptable range, 36.5\xc2\xb0C-37.3\xc2\xb0C).Main Outcomes and Measures: The composite of death or disability (moderate or severe) at 18 to 22 months adjusted for level of encephalopathy and age at randomization.Results: Hypothermic and noncooled infants were term (mean [SD], 39 [2]and 39 [1] weeks' gestation, respectively), and 47 of 83 (57%) and 55 of 85 (65%) were male, respectively. Both groups were acidemic at birth, predominantly transferred to the treating center with moderate encephalopathy, and were randomizedat a mean (SD) of 16 (5) and 15 (5) hours for hypothermic and noncooled groups, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in 19 of 78 hypothermic infants (24.4%) and 22 of 79 noncooled infants (27.9%) (absolute difference, 3.5%; 95% CI, -1% to 17%). Bayesian analysis using a neutral prior indicated a 76% posterior probability of reduced death or disability with hypothermia relative to the noncooled group (adjusted posterior risk ratio, 0.86; 95% credible interval, 0.58-1.29). The probability that death or disability in cooled infants was at least 1%, 2%, or 3% less than noncooled infants was 71%, 64%, and 56%, respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: Among term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth compared with noncooling resulted in a 76% probability of any reduction in death or disability, and a 64% probability of at least 2% less death or disability at 18 to 22 months. Hypothermia initiated at 6 to 24 hours after birth may have benefit but there is uncertainty in its effectiveness.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00614744. labels: #Bayes Theorem#Developmental Disabilities#Female#Gestational Age#Humans#Hypothermia, Induced#Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain#Infant, Newborn#Male#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Complications#Time-to-Treatment"
b'All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, is known to activate p14 expression via promoter hypermethylation to induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human hepatocytes. In this study, we found that the oncogenic hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) of HBV, derived from both overexpression and 1.2-mer replicon systems, suppresses ATRA-induced apoptosis in p53-positive human hepatocytes. For this effect, HBx upregulated both protein and enzyme activity levels of DNA methyltransferase 1, 3a and 3b, in the presence of ATRA and thereby inhibited p14 expression via promoter hypermethylation, resulting in inactivation of the p14-mouse double minute 2 pathway and subsequent downregulation of p53 levels. As a result, HBx was able to impair the potential of ATRA to activate apoptosis-related molecules, including Bax, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis, caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In conclusion, the present study provides a new oncogenic action mechanism of HBx, namely by suppressing the anticancer potential of ATRA to induce p53-dependent apoptosis in HBV-infected hepatocytes. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Apoptosis#Cell Line#Cell Survival#DNA Methylation#Down-Regulation#Genes, Tumor Suppressor#Hepatocytes#Humans#Oncogene Proteins#Trans-Activators#Tretinoin'
b'BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs in both adults and children but the response to chemotherapy and survival is significantly worse in the adults. We aimed to study whether the expression of immune system-associated miRNAs would differ between adult and pediatric patients with ALL at the time of diagnosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammation-associated miRNA analysis was performed in 19 adults and 79 pediatric patients with ALL and involved miR-10, miR-15, miR-16, miR-17-92 cluster, miR-33, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-222, miR-223, and miR-339. MiRNAs were first analyzed by miRNA microarray and thereafter validated by qRT-PCR. Sufficient RNA for qRT-PCR was available for 42 pediatric and 19 adult patients.RESULTS: Of the studied miRNAs, only miR-18a differed significantly in microarray analysis between adult and pediatric ALL, being lower in children (FC, -3.74; P, 0.0037). Results were confirmed by qRT-PCR (down-regulated in pediatric patients, P 0.003161). The other members of the miR-17-92 cluster did not differ significantly.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and adult patients with ALL have remarkably similar patterns of immune-cell-associated miRNAs in their bone marrow at diagnosis. However, the low expression of miR-18a in pediatric ALL is interesting and demands further study. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Bone Marrow#Case-Control Studies#Child#Child, Preschool#Chromosome Aberrations#Computational Biology#Female#Gene Expression#Gene Expression Profiling#Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic#Humans#Infant#Male#MicroRNAs#Middle Aged#Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma#RNA Interference#RNA, Messenger#Reproducibility of Results'
b"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is the standard treatment for aplastic anemia (AA) children who lack a sibling donor, but the clinical response rate to IST varies. Predictors of response to IST are valuable for stratifying AA patients and making clinical decisions.METHODS: The serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels of 41 AA patients were measured at the time of diagnosis and the response rate of the patients to IST was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months after IST. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to calculate the predictive value of initial IL-6 levels in determining response at 6 months after IST.RESULTS: The initial IL-6 levels were significant higher in responders than nonresponders at 6 months after IST (211.89 vs. 18.09\xe2\x80\x89pg/mL; P=0.005), using 36.8\xe2\x80\x89pg/mL as a threshold, there were 80% sensitivity and 81% specificity for discriminating responders and nonresponders to IST. Patients with initial high IL-6 level (>36.8\xe2\x80\x89pg/mL) have favorable response rates than those with initial low IL-6 level (<36.8\xe2\x80\x89pg/mL) at 3, 6, and 12 months after IST (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: High levels of IL-6 at the time of diagnosis predict a favorable response to IST in children with AA and this may be helpful for patient's stratification and clinical decisions. labels: #Adolescent#Anemia, Aplastic#Biomarkers#Blood Cell Count#Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Immunosuppressive Agents#Interleukin-6#Male#ROC Curve#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome"
b'Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a widely used agent as the first choice of treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). IVIG has several side effects, but it is a relatively safe treatment. Life-threatening thrombosis has been reported in adults and rarely in children. We report a case of a 14-year-old boy with dural venous sinus thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after treatment with IVIG for ITP. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin and the symptoms were recovered. If a patient with ITP shows mental change or respiratory difficulty, we should consider thrombosis as well as hemorrhage. labels: #Adolescent#Anticoagulants#Biopsy#Bone Marrow#Hematologic Tests#Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight#Humans#Immunoglobulins, Intravenous#Magnetic Resonance Angiography#Male#Pulmonary Embolism#Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic#Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Treatment Outcome#Venous Thrombosis#Warfarin'
b'BACKGROUND: Patients managed nonoperatively have been excluded from risk-adjusted benchmarking programs, including the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Consequently, optimal performance evaluation is not possible for specialties like emergency general surgery (EGS) where nonoperative management is common. We developed a multi-institutional EGS clinical data registry within ACS NSQIP that includes patients managed nonoperatively to evaluate variability in nonoperative care across hospitals and identify gaps in performance assessment that occur when only operative cases are considered.METHODS: Using ACS NSQIP infrastructure and methodology, surgical consultations for acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and small bowel obstruction (SBO) were sampled at 13 hospitals that volunteered to participate in the EGS clinical data registry. Standard NSQIP variables and 16 EGS-specific variables were abstracted with 30-day follow-up. To determine the influence of complications in nonoperative patients, rates of adverse outcomes were identified, and hospitals were ranked by performance with and then without including nonoperative cases.RESULTS: Two thousand ninety-one patients with EGS diagnoses were included, 46.6% with appendicitis, 24.3% with cholecystitis, and 29.1% with SBO. The overall rate of nonoperative management was 27.4%, 6.6% for appendicitis, 16.5% for cholecystitis, and 69.9% for SBO. Despite comprising only 27.4% of patients in the EGS pilot, nonoperative management accounted for 67.7% of deaths, 34.3% of serious morbidities, and 41.8% of hospital readmissions. After adjusting for patient characteristics and hospital diagnosis mix, addition of nonoperative management to hospital performance assessment resulted in 12 of 13 hospitals changing performance rank, with four hospitals changing by three or more positions.CONCLUSION: This study identifies a gap in performance evaluation when nonoperative patients are excluded from surgical quality assessment and demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating nonoperative care into existing surgical quality initiatives. Broadening the scope of hospital performance assessment to include nonoperative management creates an opportunity to improve the care of all surgical patients, not just those who have an operation.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Care management, level IV; Epidemiologic, level III. labels: #Appendicitis#Benchmarking#Cholecystitis#Emergency Medicine#Female#General Surgery#Humans#Intestinal Obstruction#Intestine, Small#Male#Pilot Projects#Quality Improvement'
b'BACKGROUND: Child abuse remains a national epidemic that has detrimental effects if unnoticed in the clinical setting. Extreme cases of child abuse, or nonaccidental trauma (NAT), have large financial burdens associated with them due to treatment costs and long-term effects of abuse. Clinicians who have additional training and experience with pediatric trauma are better equipped to detect signs of NAT and have more experience reporting it. This additional training and experience can be measured by using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Pediatric Trauma verification. It is hypothesized that ACS-verified pediatric trauma centers (vPTCs) have an increased prevalence of NAT because of this additional experience and training relative to non-ACS vPTCs.METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank, for the years 2007 to 2014, was utilized to compare the prevalence of NAT between ACS vPTCs relative to non-ACS vPTCs to produce both crude and Injury Severity Score adjusted prevalence ratio estimates.RESULTS: The majority of NAT cases across all hospitals were male (58.3%). The mean age of the NAT cases was 2.3 years with a mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 11.1. The most common payment method was Medicaid (64.4%). The prevalence of NAT was 1.82 (1.74-1.90) times higher among ACS vPTCs and 1.81 (1.73-1.90) after adjusting for ISS.CONCLUSIONS: The greater prevalence of NAT at vPTCs likely represents a more accurate measure of NAT among pediatric trauma patients, likely due to more experience and training of clinicians.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/Epidemiological, Level II. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Child Abuse#Child, Preschool#Female#Hospitals, Pediatric#Humans#Infant#Injury Severity Score#Linear Models#Male#Medicaid#Prevalence#Trauma Centers#United States'
b"BACKGROUND: Direct-to-implant breast reconstruction offers time-saving advantages over two-stage techniques. However, use of direct-to-implant reconstruction remains limited, in part, because of concerns over complication rates., The authors' aim was to compare 2-year complications and patient-reported outcomes for direct-to-implant versus tissue expander/implant reconstruction.METHODS: Patients undergoing immediate direct-to-implant or tissue expander/implant reconstruction were enrolled in the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium, an 11-center prospective cohort study. Complications and patient-reported outcomes (using the BREAST-Q questionnaire) were evaluated. Outcomes were compared using mixed-effects regression models, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics.RESULTS: Of 1427 patients, 99 underwent direct-to-implant reconstruction and 1328 underwent tissue expander/implant reconstruction. Two years after reconstruction and controlling for covariates, direct-to-implant and tissue expander/implant reconstruction patients did not show statistically significant differences in any complications, including infection. Multivariable analyses found no significant differences between the two groups in patient-reported outcomes, with the exception of sexual well-being, where direct-to-implant patients fared better than the tissue expander/implant cohort (p = 0.047).CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, multi-institutional study showed no statistically significant differences between direct-to-implant and tissue expander/implant reconstruction, in either complication rates or most patient-reported outcomes at 2 years postoperatively. Direct-to-implant reconstruction appears to be a viable alternative to expander/implant reconstruction. This analysis provides new evidence on which to base reconstructive decisions.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II. labels: #Adult#Breast Implantation#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Logistic Models#Mastectomy#Middle Aged#Patient Reported Outcome Measures#Postoperative Complications#Prospective Studies#Regression Analysis#Tissue Expansion"
b'BACKGROUND: The double capsule is a complication mostly described in aggressive macrotextured implants. Mechanical shear stress applied onto an immature periprosthetic capsule has been linked to their formation. The authors aim to demonstrate the role of bacterial phenotype and biofilm in the development of the double capsule.METHODS: Seven double capsules formed at the interface of macrotextured breast expander implants were studied using scanning electron microscopy. Two samples for each surface of the inner capsule layer (the prosthesis interface and the intercapsular space) were analyzed for bacteria cell size, bacterial density, and biofilm deposition.RESULTS: Although all routine bacterial cultures were negative, the prosthesis interface had both higher bacteria load and biofilm deposition compared with the intercapsular space (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively). Moreover, bacteria cell sizes were significantly smaller at the prosthesis interface in six of seven samples. Comparison of bacteria density and biofilm dispersion showed an increase of biofilm extracellular matrix deposition over 2000 cells/mm (linear regression, p = 0.0025). These results indicate a common trend among bacteria species.CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial expression between the different surfaces of the double capsule displays significant differences; bacteria at the prosthesis interface are mostly in a biofilm state, whereas they demonstrate a planktonic phenotype at the intercapsular space. When a sufficient amount of bacteria are present at a specific location, quorum sensing may trigger a biofilm phenotypic switch in planktonic bacteria cells. Biofilm formation may alter capsule formation through immune response, thereby weakening capsule strength and facilitating extracellular matrix delamination and double-capsule formation.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V. labels: #Adult#Biofilms#Breast Implantation#Breast Implants#Female#Foreign-Body Reaction#Humans#Microscopy, Electron, Scanning#Middle Aged#Postoperative Complications#Prospective Studies#Tissue Expansion#Tissue Expansion Devices'
b'BACKGROUND: Modern breast reconstruction often involves microvascular reconstruction. The most common recipient vessels are the internal mammary artery and vein. Recently, there has been great focus on efficiency, but much of this emphasis has been directed to faster flap harvest or recovery protocols for expeditious discharge. An equally important aspect is internal mammary vessel preparation.METHODS: Breast reconstruction was performed in 415 patients (715 breasts) using autologous tissue (850 flaps) from 2012 to 2016. In 97.6 percent of these breast reconstructions, the internal mammary vessels were used. The preparation of these vessels was routinely performed using the five-step technique described here.RESULTS: Internal mammary preparation time ranged from 7 to 45 minutes (median, 15 minutes). The procedure involves five simplified steps, as follows: step 1, the rib is exposed by splitting the pectoralis major muscle; step 2, the perichondrium anterior to the cartilage is incised and dissected away from the cartilage; step 3, the cartilage is removed with a rongeur; step 4, laterally the perichondrium is elevated and incised (under direct vision, this perichondrium is then split directly over the vessels and the cranial and caudal flaps are resected); and step 5, careful dissection is performed on the artery and vein.CONCLUSIONS: Safe preparation of recipient vessels in microvascular reconstruction is essential for success. In modern breast reconstruction, the internal mammary artery and vein are typically used. Exposure of these vessels should be predictable and efficient. The authors have found that a systematic approach using the above five steps accomplishes these goals. labels: #Dissection#Female#Humans#Mammaplasty#Mammary Arteries#Operative Time#Surgical Flaps'
b"The American Society of Plastic Surgeons commissioned a multistakeholder Work Group to develop recommendations for autologous breast reconstruction with abdominal flaps. A systematic literature review was performed and a stringent appraisal process was used to rate the quality of relevant scientific research. The Work Group assigned to draft this guideline was unable to find evidence of superiority of one technique over the other (deep inferior epigastric perforator versus pedicled transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap) in autologous tissue reconstruction of the breast after mastectomy. Presently, based on the evidence reported here, the Work Group recommends that surgeons contemplating breast reconstruction on their next patient consider the following: the patient's preferences and risk factors, the setting in which the surgeon works (academic versus community practice), resources available, the evidence shown in this guideline, and, equally important, the surgeon's technical expertise. Although theoretical superiority of one technique may exist, this remains to be reported in the literature, and future methodologically robust studies are needed. labels: #Clinical Decision-Making#Epigastric Arteries#Female#Humans#Mammaplasty#Mastectomy#Patient Satisfaction#Postoperative Complications#Rectus Abdominis#Reoperation#Surgical Flaps"
b"BACKGROUND: In their descriptions of the ideal breast, most studies have focused primarily on the dimensions, shape, and proportions. The distance between the breasts has only very rarely been considered. The intermammary distance and the medial symmetry between the breasts are important parts of the outcome of surgery and have a strong bearing on patient satisfaction. However, the control surgeons have over these factors is only relative, and depends heavily on the underlying anatomical characteristics of the patients.METHODS: Eighty-six patients undergoing breast augmentation, breast reduction, or mastopexy and breast reconstruction with separated or asymmetric breasts underwent fat grafting in the medial quadrants. Intermammary distances were measured before fat grafting and 12 months later. Complications were also recorded.RESULTS: This technique obtained a statistically significant reduction in the mean intermammary distance (p<0.0001) from 3 \xc2\xb1 0.6 cm (range, 1.6 to 5 cm) to 1.7 \xc2\xb1 0.4 cm (range, 1 to 2.8 cm) at 12-month follow-up. There were no major complications: one capsular contracture in a breast reconstruction requiring capsulotomy and an oil cyst requiring aspiration were reported.CONCLUSION: The authors' technique allows safe remodeling of the medial cleavage of the breast, reducing the intermammary distance and optimizing the symmetry between the breasts.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Breast#Esthetics#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Mammaplasty#Middle Aged#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Patient Satisfaction#Prospective Studies#Subcutaneous Fat#Young Adult"
b'BACKGROUND: The traditional abdominoplasty is one of the most common surgical procedures performed. This study evaluates the impact of different surgical techniques and clinical patient factors on abdominoplasty outcomes.METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing abdominoplasty was performed.RESULTS: Seven hundred seventy-nine patients with a mean age of 43.7 years and a body mass index of 27 kg/m underwent abdominoplasty. The majority were women (92.9 percent), and massive weight loss was present in 34.8 percent. Abdominoplasty techniques included traditional (59.4 percent), belt lipectomy (17.9 percent), fleur-de-lis (16.4 percent), umbilical float (9.2 percent), and mini-abdominoplasty (2.8 percent). Half of the study population [n = 384 (49.3 percent)] had concurrent surgical procedures. Total complications (23.0 percent) consisted primarily of wound- and scar-related complications (15.3 percent). Approximately 60 percent of patients received heparin chemoprophylaxis, with overall thromboembolic and hematoma rates less than 1 percent. Univariate analysis revealed that massive weight loss (p = 0.04), fleur-de-lis (p = 0.03) or belt lipectomy (p = 0.05) techniques, and concurrent medial thigh lift(p<0.001) all significantly increased complications. Previous scars, amount of weight loss, operative time, liposuction, and other concurrent procedures did not affect total complications. Male sex (OR, 1.96; p = 0.04), fleur-de-lis technique (OR, 1.71; p = 0.04), and medial thigh lift (OR, 3.3; p<0.001) were independent risk factors for total postoperative complications.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that abdominoplasty alone or in combination with liposuction and aesthetic breast surgery can be performed safely, with an acceptable complication profile.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, III. labels: #Abdominoplasty#Adult#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Hospitals, General#Humans#Lipectomy#Male#Mammaplasty#Massachusetts#Middle Aged#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies'
b'BACKGROUND: There are instances where small or large pockets are filled with diced cartilage in the nose, without use of wrapping materials. For this purpose, 1-cc commercial syringes were used. The obtained results were partial and incomplete. For better and improved results, the author designed new syringes, with two different sizes, which compress the diced cartilage for injection.METHODS: The author presents his experience accrued over the past 12 years with 2366 primary, 749 secondary, 67 cleft lip and nose, and a total of 3182 rhinoplasties, using his new syringe design, which compresses diced cartilage and injects the diced cartilages as a conglutinate mass, simulating carved costal cartilage, but a malleable one.RESULTS: In 3125 patients, the take of cartilage graft was complete (98.2 percent) and a smooth surface was obtained, giving them a natural appearance. In 21 patients (0.65 percent), there was partial resorption of cartilage. Correction was performed with touch-up surgery by reinjection of a small amount of diced cartilage. In 36 patients (1.13 percent), there was overcorrection that, 1 year later, was treated by simple rasping.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with diced cartilage wrapped with Surgicel or fascia, the amount of injected cartilage graft is predictable because it consists purely of cartilage. The injected diced cartilage, because it is compressed and becomes a conglutinated mass, resembles a wood chip and simulates carved cartilage. It is superior to carved cartilage in that it is moldable, time saving, and gives a good result with no late show or warping. The injection takes only a few minutes. labels: #Adult#Cartilage#Female#Humans#Injections#Rhinoplasty#Syringes'
b'Alar flare is a common feature that contributes to the width of the lower third of the nose. In the right patient, alar flare reduction can improve nasal harmony and facial aesthetic balance; however, it is also difficult to correct if conducted inappropriately or overzealously. The unique anatomy and diverse morphologies of the alar lobule, and the dynamic relationship between flare and changes in tip projection, must be considered. The authors provide guidelines for flare reduction: when it is appropriate and how to tailor the excision pattern to safely and effectively refine nasal width. Alar flare is classified into three types according to alar rim shape on basal view analysis. By designing the excision pattern based on specific flare type, the lower third of the nose is narrowed without creating an operated appearance.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V. labels: #Adult#Female#Humans#Nose#Rhinoplasty'
b'Despite the growth of technically more sophisticated skin resurfacing modalities, such as those based on light, radiofrequency, and ultrasound, chemical peel procedures have risen 5 to 25 percent over the past year alone. Chemexfoliation carries historical significance and has markedly evolved since its inception in ancient times. As a result of plastic surgery and dermatologic advancements, modern-day chemexfoliation offers plastic surgeons additional safe and effective options for patients with rhytides, dyschromias, and other signs of light- and environment-induced skin damage. This review discusses the historical evolution of chemexfoliation procedures, highlights modern-day practice habits, and touches on the clinically relevant applications of chemical peels. labels: #Chemexfoliation#Europe#History, 16th Century#History, 19th Century#History, 20th Century#History, 21st Century#History, Ancient#Humans#Rejuvenation#United States'

The phenotype of Binder "syndrome" includes the following: midfacial hypoplasia, class III malocclusion, small or absent anterior nasal spine, flattened nose, horizontal nostrils, short columella, acute nasolabial angle, and a flat frontonasal angle. A staged approach is used, with orthognathic surgery to achieve vertical maxillary length and sagittal advancement, followed by rhinoplasty aimed to increase nasal tip projection, rotation, and columellar length.

b'BACKGROUND: Wide variations in fat graft survival have been reported. The authors hypothesize that treating the adipose tissue on Telfa gauze creates a processed lipoaspirate with a more functional adipokine profile that improves fat graft survival.METHODS: Suction-assisted lipoaspirate was harvested from humans and was either processed by centrifugation, rolled on Telfa gauze, or left unprocessed. Progenitor cell populations were quantified and characterized by flow cytometry. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase assay was used to measure the functional adipocytes. The lipoaspirates were grafted into (n = 45) wild-type mice and harvested to assess fat graft persistence. Vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-BB secretions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.RESULTS: Centrifuged lipoaspirate had a greater number of progenitor cells per gram of tissue than Telfa-processed and unprocessed lipoaspirate. However, Telfa-processed lipoaspirate had a greater number of functional adipocytes (0.104 U/ml) than centrifuged (0.080 U/ml) and unprocessed lipoaspirate (0.083 U/ml) on glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase assay (p<0.05). After 10 weeks of grafting, it had greater fat graft persistence (70.9 \xc2\xb1 6.2 percent) than centrifuged (56.7 \xc2\xb1 5.5 percent) and unprocessed lipoaspirate (42.2 \xc2\xb1 2.7 percent) (p<0.05). It also maintained a greater secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-BB at weeks 1 and 2 than centrifuged and unprocessed lipoaspirate. Furthermore, CD31 staining demonstrated an increase in vascular density of the Telfa-processed lipoaspirate at week 2 compared with the centrifuged lipoaspirate (37 \xc2\xb1 1 percent and 14 \xc2\xb1 4 percent per high-power field; p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Lipoaspirate processing technique has a significant impact on fat graft survival rate. Increasing the number of functional adipocytes by processing the fat on Telfa gauze may augment the secretion of angiogenic and mitogenic adipokines within the graft, thereby improving its survivability.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V. labels: #Adipocytes#Adipokines#Adult#Animals#Biomarkers#Centrifugation#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Flow Cytometry#Fluorescent Antibody Technique#Graft Survival#Humans#Lipectomy#Male#Mice#Middle Aged#Specimen Handling#Subcutaneous Fat#Transplantation, Heterologous'
b"BACKGROUND: Understanding the precise anatomy in experimental animals is crucial for correct design of research projects. Rats are commonly used for scientific research in plastic surgery because of their availability in academic institutions, moderate cost, and sizable vessels for microsurgical procedures. In past publications about rat anatomy, lymphatic mapping has been limited and incomplete. The aim of this study was to comprehensively map the superficial lymphatic system in the rat.METHODS: Twenty-seven Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography was used to identify the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Under general anaesthesia, indocyanine green was injected intradermally at multiple spots along the dorsal and medial midlines, front and hind paws, ears, and tail. The course of the lymphatic vessels was traced on the skin with a marker pen and photographed. The superficial lymphatic vessels in each rat were sketched on a graphic template and all of the templates were superimposed using graphics software to define the relationship between the lymphatic vessel and sentinel node.RESULTS: Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography was able to demonstrate the superficial lymphatic vessels in the rat. Six groups of regional lymph node/s were identified and lymphatic pathways to those nodes delineated. The authors' lymphosome concept was successfully applied to the rat, with six lymphosomes identified.CONCLUSIONS: The authors succeeded in performing superficial lymphatic mapping in the rat. The authors' anatomical findings can provide further information about the lymphatic system in the normal state and promote understanding of pathologic changes generated by surgical manipulation for future studies. labels: #Animals#Female#Fluorescent Dyes#Indocyanine Green#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Vessels#Lymphography#Male#Models, Animal#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Skin"
b'BACKGROUND: Although surgical excision and intralesional collagenase injection are mainstays in Dupuytren disease treatment, no effective medical therapy exists for recurrent disease. Compound 21, a selective agonist of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, has been shown to protect against fibrosis in models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The authors investigated the potential use of compound 21 in the treatment of Dupuytren disease.METHODS: Human dermal fibroblasts were treated in vitro with compound 21 and assessed for viability using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, migration by means of scratch assay, and profibrotic gene transcription by means of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Compound 21 effects in vivo were assessed using a xenograft model. Dupuytren disease cord specimens from patients undergoing open partial fasciectomy were divided into two segments. Segments were implanted under the dorsal skin of nude mouse pairs. Beginning on day 5, one mouse from each pair received daily intraperitoneal injections of compound 21 (10 \xce\xbcg/kg/day), and the other received vehicle. On day 10, segments were explanted and submitted for immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Human dermal fibroblasts treated with compound 21 displayed decreased migration and decreased gene expression of connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast specific protein-1, transforming growth factor-\xce\xb21, Smad3, and Smad4. Dupuytren disease segments from compound 21-treated mice demonstrated significantly reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin and Ki67 staining, with increased density of CD31 staining vessels.CONCLUSIONS: Compound 21 significantly decreases expression of profibrotic genes and decreases myofibroblast proliferation as indicated by reduced Ki67 and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. These findings support compound 21 as a potential novel treatment modality for Dupuytren disease. labels: #Animals#Anti-Inflammatory Agents#Biomarkers#Cell Movement#Cell Survival#Cells, Cultured#Drug Administration Schedule#Dupuytren Contracture#Female#Fibroblasts#Humans#Injections, Intraperitoneal#Mice#Mice, Inbred BALB C#Mice, Nude#Random Allocation#Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2#Sulfonamides#Thiophenes'
b'BACKGROUND: The Resurfacing Capitate Pyrocarbon Implant associated with proximal row carpectomy has been used to treat symptomatic advanced carpal collapse, widening the indications of proximal row carpectomy to patients with capitate head arthritis. The authors retrospectively compared their case series of implant versus carpectomy alone, analyzing whether prosthetic implant outcomes could be similar to those of proximal row carpectomy even with a higher stage of osteoarthritis.METHODS: Fifty-seven patients who underwent surgery for wrist osteoarthritis (minimum follow-up, 2 years) were selected retrospectively. Twenty-five patients (scapholunate advanced collapse/scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse stage III to IV and Kienb\xc3\xb6ck disease stage IV) underwent proximal row carpectomy plus Resurfacing Capitate Pyrocarbon Implant (group A); 32 patients (scapholunate advanced collapse/scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse stage I to II and Kienb\xc3\xb6ck disease stage III) underwent carpectomy alone (group B). Mean follow-up was 33 months. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically. Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire scores were assessed.RESULTS: Group A showed consistent pain relief (visual analogue scale score of 2), while preserving wrist mobility (flexion, 27 degrees; extension, 33 degrees) and grip strength (54 percent compared with the contralateral side). Average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire score was 20, and average Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation score was 28. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups for all outcomes, except for better extension (p<0.05) in group B.CONCLUSIONS: Even starting from a higher grade of osteoarthritis, Resurfacing Capitate Pyrocarbon Implant plus proximal row carpectomy showed satisfying results, compared with those obtained with just carpectomy. Data show that indications for proximal row carpectomy can be widened by using the implant, without worsening outcomes. The implant could be a useful alternative to more aggressive salvage procedures in case of capitate head and lunate fossa osteoarthritis involvement.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Arthroplasty, Replacement#Carbon#Carpal Bones#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Joint Prosthesis#Male#Middle Aged#Osteoarthritis#Radiography#Retrospective Studies#Wrist Joint'
b"BACKGROUND: The effects of orthognathic surgery go beyond objective cephalometric correction of facial and dental disproportion and malocclusion, respectively. The authors hypothesized that there is tangible improvement following surgery that alters publicly perceived personality traits and emotions.METHODS: The authors used Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing tool, to determine how preoperative and postoperative images of orthognathic surgery patients were perceived on six personality traits and six emotional expressions based on posteroanterior and lateral photographs. Blinded respondents provided demographic information and were randomly assigned to one of two sets of 20 photographs (10 subjects before and after surgery).RESULTS: Data on 20 orthognathic surgery patients were collected from 476 individuals. The majority of participants were female (52.6 percent), 18 to 39 years old (67.9 percent), Caucasian (76.6 percent), had some college or technical training or graduated college (72.7 percent), and had an annual income between $20,000 and $99,999 (74.6 percent). A paired t test analysis found that subjects were perceived significantly more favorably after orthognathic surgery in 12 countenance categories: more dominant, trustworthy, friendly, intelligent, attractive, and happy; and also less threatening, angry, surprised, sad, afraid, and disgusted (p<0.05). Raters with the highest annual income perceived a greater magnitude of dominance after surgery than those earning less (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: There is significant improvement in the countenance of patients after orthognathic surgery, with both perceived personality traits and emotions deemed more favorable. Additional work is needed to better understand the physiologic underpinnings of such findings. Crowdsourcing technology offers a unique opportunity for surgeons to gather data regarding laypeople's perceptions of surgical outcomes in areas such as orthognathic surgery. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Crowdsourcing#Emotions#Facial Expression#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Orthognathic Surgical Procedures#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Personality#Postoperative Period#Preoperative Period#Single-Blind Method#Social Perception#United States#Young Adult"
b'BACKGROUND: The relationships between hospital/surgeon characteristics and operative outcomes and cost are being scrutinized increasingly. In patients with craniosynostosis specifically, the relationship between hospital volume and outcomes has yet to be characterized.METHODS: Subjects undergoing craniosynostosis surgery between 2004 and 2015 were identified in the Pediatric Health Information System. Outcomes were compared between two exposure groups, those undergoing treatment at a high-volume institution (>40 cases per year), and those undergoing treatment at a low-volume institution (40 cases per year). Primary outcomes were any complication, prolonged length of stay, and increased total cost.RESULTS: Over 13,000 patients (n = 13,112) from 49 institutions met inclusion criteria. In multivariate regression analyses, subjects treated in high-volume centers were less likely to experience any complication (OR, 0.764; p<0.001), were less likely to have an extended length of stay (OR, 0.624; p<0.001), and were less likely to have increased total cost (OR, 0.596; p<0.001). Subjects undergoing strip craniectomy in high-volume centers were also less likely to have any complication (OR, 0.708; p = 0.018) or increased total cost (OR, 0.51; p<0.001). Subjects undergoing midvault reconstruction in high-volume centers were less likely to experience any complications (OR, 0.696; p = 0.002), have an extended length of stay (OR, 0.542; p<0.001), or have increased total cost (OR, 0.495; p<0.001).CONCLUSION: In hospitals performing a high volume of craniosynostosis surgery, subjects had significantly decreased odds of experiencing a complication, prolonged length of stay, or increased total cost compared with those undergoing treatment in low-volume institutions.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III. labels: #Child, Preschool#Craniosynostoses#Databases, Factual#Female#Hospitals, High-Volume#Hospitals, Low-Volume#Hospitals, Pediatric#Humans#Infant#Infant, Newborn#Length of Stay#Logistic Models#Male#Multivariate Analysis#Odds Ratio#Orthopedic Procedures#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Postoperative Complications#United States'
b'To make three-dimensional computer-assisted elastic models for the face, we decided on five requirements: (1) an elastic texture like skin and subcutaneous tissue; (2) the ability to take pen marking for incisions; (3) the ability to be cut with a surgical knife; (4) the ability to keep stitches in place for a long time; and (5) a layered structure. After testing many elastic solvents, we have made realistic three-dimensional computer-assisted two-layer elastic models of the face and cleft lip from the computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging stereolithographic data. The surface layer is made of polyurethane and the inner layer is silicone. Using this elastic model, we taught residents and young doctors how to make several typical local flaps and to perform cheiloplasty. They could experience realistic simulated surgery and understand three-dimensional movement of the flaps. labels: #Cleft Lip#Face#Humans#Image Processing, Computer-Assisted#Imaging, Three-Dimensional#Infant#Japan#Lip#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Models, Anatomic#Polyurethanes#Printing, Three-Dimensional#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Silicones#Simulation Training#Surgical Flaps#Tomography, X-Ray Computed'
b"BACKGROUND: Open tibia fractures are commonly stratified by the Gustilo classification, an orthopedic grading system that does not incorporate the presence of arterial injury when limb perfusion is intact. In the authors' experience, however, the presence of arterial injury appears to negatively impact microsurgical outcomes.METHODS: In a retrospective review of 806 lower extremity reconstructions between 1979 and 2016, 361 soft-tissue flaps performed for Gustilo type IIIB/C coverage met inclusion criteria. Patient demographics, flap characteristics, and outcomes were analyzed.RESULTS: Most patients suffered type IIIB [n = 332 (91.9 percent)] injuries; 29 (8.0 percent) had type IIIC injuries. Preoperative angiography [n = 243 (67.3 percent)]demonstrated arterial injury in 126 (51.8 percent); 27 arterial injuries were identified intraoperatively; and the overall incidence was 153 of 361 (42.4 percent). Complications occurred in 143 flaps (39.6 percent) and included 37 partial losses (10.2 percent) and 31 total losses (8.6 percent). Injured recipient arteries [n = 62 (17.2 percent)] had more complications (p = 0.004); specifically, increased take-backs (p = 0.009). Decreasing vessel runoff increased the risk of complications (p = 0.025), take-backs (p = 0.007), and total flap failures (p = 0.024) accordingly. Specifically, among grade IIIB injuries, controlling for age, sex, time since injury, and vein number, single-vessel runoff was associated with higher rates of complications (relative risk, 3.07; p = 0.012), take-backs (relative risk, 3.43; p = 0.013), and total flap failures (relative risk, 4.80; p = 0.010) compared with three-vessel runoff.CONCLUSIONS: Arterial injury was common among Gustilo type IIIB patients and correlated with increased reconstructive complications. Nonischemic arterial injury appears to negatively impact reconstructive outcomes and should be accounted for when considering free tissue transfer for lower extremity salvage. The authors propose a 3-2-1 modification of the Gustilo type IIIB classification to incorporate degree of arterial injury, as it appears to add prognostic value and certainly influences the reconstructive plan.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, IV. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Arteries#Child#Female#Fibula#Fractures, Open#Free Tissue Flaps#Humans#Leg Injuries#Limb Salvage#Male#Middle Aged#Popliteal Artery#Postoperative Complications#Retrospective Studies#Tibial Arteries#Tibial Fractures#Trauma Severity Indices#Treatment Outcome#Vascular System Injuries#Young Adult"
b"BACKGROUND: Many plastic surgeons use social media as a marketing tool to attract and retain patients, but information about how patients use social media and their preferred types of plastic surgery posts have been lacking.METHODS: To investigate patients' preferred social media networks and the type of posts they wished to see, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a single aesthetic practice of two plastic surgeons by surveying 100 consecutive patients.RESULTS: The age of the patients averaged 44.4 years (range, 17 to 78 years). Facebook had the greatest patient use and engagement, with YouTube second in use, and Instagram second in number of engaged users. Over half used Pinterest, but with little daily engagement. Only one-fourth used Snapchat, but the percentage of users who were highly engaged was second only to Facebook. The least popular network was Twitter, with the fewest patient users and least engagement. Social media played a minor role compared with the practice's Web site in both influencing patients to choose the practice and providing information on the day of the appointment. Patients most wanted to see posts on a plastic surgeon's social media platform related to practice information, before-and-after photographs, and contests. Articles about plastic surgery held the least interest. Among five types of Web site content, patients expressed most interest in before-and-after photographs.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to articulate the plastic surgery patient perspective regarding social media. The findings aim to help plastic surgeons maximize their influence on their target audience. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#California#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Health Care Surveys#Humans#Male#Marketing of Health Services#Middle Aged#Patient Preference#Physician-Patient Relations#Social Media#Surgery, Plastic#Young Adult"
b"BACKGROUND: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and Plastic Surgery Milestone Project has identified practice-based learning and improvement, which involves systematically analyzing current practices and implementing changes, as a core competency in residency education. In surgical care, complication reporting is an essential component of practice-based learning and improvement as complications are analyzed in morbidity and mortality conference for quality improvement. Unfortunately, current methods for capturing a comprehensive profile of complications may significantly underestimate the true occurrence of complications. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate an intervention for complication reporting and compare this to current practice, in a plastic surgery training program.METHODS: This is a preintervention and postintervention study evaluating resident reporting of complications on a plastic surgery service. The intervention was an online event reporting system developed by department leadership and patient safety experts. The cohorts consisted of all patients undergoing surgery during two separate 3-month blocks bridged by an implementation period. A trained reviewer recorded complications, and this served as the reference standard. Fisher's exact test was used for binary comparisons.RESULTS: There were 32 complications detected in 219 patients from June to August of 2015 and 35 complications in 202 patients from October to December of 2015. The proportion of complications reported in the preintervention group was nine of 32 (28.1 percent). After the intervention, this significantly increased to 32 of 35 (91.4 percent) (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: An intervention using an event reporting system, supported by departmental leadership, led to significant improvements in complication reporting by plastic surgery residents. labels: #Clinical Competence#Data Collection#Documentation#Humans#Internet#Internship and Residency#Medical Records Systems, Computerized#Missouri#Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)#Patient Safety#Pediatrics#Postoperative Complications#Quality Improvement#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Surgery, Plastic"
b"Virtual reality and augmented reality devices have recently been described in the surgical literature. The authors have previously explored various iterations of these devices, and although they show promise, it has become clear that virtual reality and/or augmented reality devices alone do not adequately meet the demands of surgeons. The solution may lie in a hybrid technology known as mixed reality, which merges many virtual reality and augmented realty features. Microsoft's HoloLens, the first commercially available mixed reality device, provides surgeons intraoperative hands-free access to complex data, the real environment, and bidirectional communication. This report describes the use of HoloLens in the operating room to improve decision-making and surgical workflow. The pace of mixed reality-related technological development will undoubtedly be rapid in the coming years, and plastic surgeons are ideally suited to both lead and benefit from this advance. labels: #Clinical Decision-Making#Holography#Humans#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Surgery, Computer-Assisted#User-Computer Interface#Workflow"
b"RATIONALE: Giant fibrovascular polyps (GFVPs) found in the hypopharynx are exceedingly rare. These are benign tumors which are identified by CT or MRI and usually treated based on symptoms. Even more rarely, pathology may identify one of these masses as an atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT). This paper will present a case of an ALT of the hypopharynx that was originally classified as a GFVP, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing between them and the importance of making the correct diagnosis.PATIENT CONCERNS: An 84-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 6-month history of a pedunculated hypopharyngeal growth, dysphagia, and intermittent dyspnea.DIAGNOSES: The mass was characterized as a GFVP by barium swallow and MRI.INTERVENTIONS: The hypopharyngeal mass was resected for obstructive symptoms and to confirm the diagnosis. Final pathology found the mass to be more consistent with an atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT).OUTCOMES: The patient's dysphagia and dyspnea resolved. He was free of recurrence at 22 months postoperative.LESSONS: Both GFVPs and ALTs are very rarely found in the hypopharynx but can be easily misclassified as one another. Imaging is useful to initially characterize the mass, but to definitively differentiate between them, pathological analysis is necessary. Although they are rare, it is important to consider both possibilities on the differential for hypopharyngeal masses. Further, accurate analysis is essential to distinguish between them because their definitive management and follow-up is different. labels: #Aged, 80 and over#Deglutition Disorders#Diagnosis, Differential#Dyspnea#Humans#Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms#Lipoma#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Polyps"
b'This study aimed to explore the value of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans in the differential diagnosis of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, minimal invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC), which manifested as ground glass nodules (GGNs) or mixed GGNs.Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced presurgical CT images of 136 cases of GGNs were compared. The nodules were diagnosed based on their solid portions and maximum dimensions, and the findings obtained using both contrast-enhanced and unenhanced CT images were analyzed in corroboration with the pathological diagnosis.Most (53/56) preinvasive nodules showed increased mean CT values after contrast administration. In the MIA group, after contrast administration, enlargements of the solid portions were seen in 48 nodules (48/60), and the elevation of the mean CT value was observed in 12 nodules (12/60). The vast majority of IAC nodules (29/30) showed enlargement of the solid portions after contrast administration. Moreover, for group differences, findings obtained using this approach statistically match the pathological findings.Contrast-enhanced CT scans are more useful than unenhanced CT scans for the diagnosis of GGNs, especially for pure GGNs, before surgery. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Adenocarcinoma in Situ#Contrast Media#Diagnosis, Differential#Humans#Hyperplasia#Lung#Lung Neoplasms#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Radiographic Image Enhancement#Retrospective Studies#Tomography, X-Ray Computed'
b'BACKGROUND: We compared the effectiveness and safety of endotracheal intubation using the GlideScope (GS) video laryngoscope, CTrach laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or Shikani optical stylet rigid laryngoscope (SOS) during elective cervical surgery.METHODS: Forty-five patients undergoing elective cervical surgery were randomly and equally assigned to endotracheal intubation via GS, LMA, or SOS airway management.RESULTS: Endotracheal intubation was successfully completed in all patients. The mean intubation times of the groups differed significantly (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01): GS, 17.9\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a3.1\xe2\x80\x8as; SOS, 40.4\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a13.7\xe2\x80\x8as; and LMA, 80.5\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a22.5\xe2\x80\x8as. The groups had similar heart rates and mean arterial pressures throughout the intubation, except that at 2\xe2\x80\x8aminutes after intubation the mean arterial pressure of the GS group (106.1\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a18.5\xe2\x80\x8amm Hg) was significantly higher than that of the LMA (89.7\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a18.5\xe2\x80\x8amm Hg) or SOS (89.7\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a18.5\xe2\x80\x8amm Hg; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01). The change in C2-5 Cobb angle from baseline was significantly higher in the GS group (GS, 34.2\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a7.3\xc2\xb0) than the LMA (24.4\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a5.8\xc2\xb0) or SOS (25.5\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a6.4\xc2\xb0); P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01).CONCLUSIONS: The CTrach LMA and SOS rigid laryngoscope are effective, safe alternatives to the GS video laryngoscope for patients undergoing elective cervical surgery. labels: #Cervical Vertebrae#Female#Hemorrhage#Hoarseness#Humans#Intubation, Intratracheal#Laryngeal Masks#Laryngoscopes#Male#Middle Aged#Pain'
b'Neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus (NETTs) are rare but aggressive, and lead to poor overall survival. This retrospective study was designed to analyze factors that correlate with the prognosis of patients with NETTs.From 1999 to 2015, 41 ongoing patients with NETTs were enrolled in this study. The clinical data and outcome were compiled. Overall survival (OS) rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method in univariate analysis and the Cox-model was used in multivariate analysis.Of the 41 NETTs patients analyzed (31 male and 10 female), 12 were typical carcinoma, 14 were atypical carcinoma, 14 were small-cell carcinoma and, 1 was large-cell carcinoma. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range, 9.0-69.0). In total, 25 patients died of cancer-related disease by the last follow-up. The 3- and 5-year survival rates for all patients were 42.7% and 23.4%, respectively. Among the prognostic factors analyzed by multivariate analysis, low tumor grade, complete resection, and a negative chromogranin A (CgA) expression were positively correlated with survival.The surgical treatment of NETTs, CgA negative, and low grade of NETTs were associated with a statistically significant better prognosis. However, large, multicenter studies are required to fully validate these prognostic factors. labels: #Adult#Aged#Chromogranin A#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Neoplasm Grading#Neoplasm Staging#Neuroendocrine Tumors#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Thymus Neoplasms'
b"RATIONALE: Bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT) is a poorly-understood ocular syndrome in which patients present with acute iridocyclitis and pigmentary dispersion with or without ocular hypertension. The etiology of the disease remains unknown, though recent reports suggest an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection or systemic antibiotic administration may trigger the clinical syndrome.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old female was referred for a second opinion regarding her bilateral ocular pain, photophobia, and ocular hypertension. Her medical history was notable for a diagnosis of pneumonia managed with oral moxifloxacin several weeks prior to her initial presentation.DIAGNOSES: Visual acuity was 20/40 with an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 30\xe2\x80\x8ammHg in the affected eye despite maximal tolerated medical therapy. The patient had severe bilateral iris transillumination defects with posterior synechiae formation and 3+ pigment with rare cell in the anterior chamber. This constellation of findings was consistent with a diagnosis of BAIT.INTERVENTIONS: A peripheral iridotomy was placed, which mildly relieved the iris bowing, but did not affect the IOP or inflammatory reaction. The patient then underwent cataract extraction with posterior synechiolysis and ab interno trabeculotomy of the left eye with the Trabectome.OUTCOMES: The patient's IOP on the first post-operative day was 13\xe2\x80\x8ammHg, and anterior chamber inflammation was noted to be significantly reduced at post-operative week 2. The patient was recently seen at a 1-year post-operative visit and her IOP remains in the low teens on a low-dose combination topical agent.LESSONS: Ophthalmologists should remain aware of the association between systemic fluoroquinolones and acute pigmentary dispersion that can progress to glaucoma. The Trabectome remains a viable option for management of pigmentary and uveitic glaucoma resistant to medical treatment. labels: #Anti-Bacterial Agents#Cataract Extraction#Eye Pain#Female#Fluoroquinolones#Glaucoma, Open-Angle#Humans#Middle Aged#Ocular Hypertension#Photophobia#Pneumonia, Bacterial#Trabeculectomy"
b'RATIONALE: Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare disease of lymphomatous effusion in the body cavities in the absence of detectable mass and lymphadenopathy. PEL is predominantly related to the immunosuppressed patients infected with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). PEL-like lymphoma is negative for HHV-8 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) unlike PEL. The pathogenesis and prognosis of PEL-like lymphoma are unclear and there is no established treatment yet.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 73-year-old male patient was admitted for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion with 1-week duration. His relevant examinations were completed.DIAGNOSES: PEL-like lymphoma was diagnosed.INTERVENTIONS: The patient received chemotherapy including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP), and palliative whole-brain radiotherapy, sequentially.OUTCOMES: He died 3 months after the diagnosis.LESSON: Although the prognosis of PEL-like lymphoma may be better than PEL, our case showed poor disease course despite chemotherapy. labels: #Aged#Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived#Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Brain Neoplasms#Cardiac Tamponade#Cyclophosphamide#Doxorubicin#Dyspnea#Herpesvirus 8, Human#Humans#Immunocompetence#Lymphoma, Primary Effusion#Male#Palliative Care#Prednisone#Radiotherapy#Treatment Outcome#Vincristine'
b'RATIONALE: A 33-year-old male presented with complete weakness of the right extremities due to corona radiata infarct.PATIENT CONCERNS: The main concerns of the patient is recovery of hand function especially related to finger extension.DIAGNOSES: Right corona radiata infarct.INTERVENTIONS: He underwent physical therapy and occupational therapy at the outpatient clinic of the rehabilitation department of the same university hospital until 2 years after onset. In addition, he underwent neuromuscular electrical stimulation for the right finger extensors continuously until 4 years after onset.OUTCOMES: At 6 months after onset, the weakness of his right side recovered to subnormal state except for the right finger extensors which were completely weak. At 1.5 years after onset, the right finger extensors began to show slow and continuous recovery. At 4 years after onset, the patient showed motor recovery in the right finger extensors to the extent that he was able to move against gravity. Discontinuation of the left corticospinal tract was observed on 2-month diffusion tensor tractography (DTT); however, the integrity of this discontinuation had recovered to the primary motor cortex on 4-year DTT. On 2-month transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), no motor-evoked potential was evoked; in contrast, motor-evoked potentials were obtained at the right-hand muscle on 4-year TMS study.LESSONS: We demonstrated unusual delayed and long-term recovery of the affected finger extensors in a patient with corona radiata infarct using DTT and TMS. labels: #Adult#Brain Infarction#Diffusion Tensor Imaging#Electric Stimulation Therapy#Fingers#Humans#Male#Recovery of Function#Stroke Rehabilitation#Time Factors#Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation'
b'The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging for differentiating superficial lymph nodes.Virtual touch tissue imaging (VTI) grade and shear wave velocity (SWV) were analyzed and compared in 97 patients (65 women, 32 men; mean age, 49 y; range, 23-72 y) with 97 lymph nodes [23 chronic nonspecific reactive lymph nodes (CLNs), 38 metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs), and 36 blood and lymphatic system diseases lymph nodes (BLLNs)]. The elastography characteristics in patients with CLNs, MLNs, and BLLNs were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and categorical variables. The diagnostic performance of VTI grade and SWV were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).The median of SWV of MLNs was significantly higher (2.90\xe2\x80\x8am/s) than those of CLNs (2.15\xe2\x80\x8am/s) and BLLNs (2.52\xe2\x80\x8am/s). The VTI grade of MLNs was significantly higher than those of CLNs (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and BLLNs (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 81.58%, 95.65%, 86.89%, and 0.904, respectively, at a cutoff level of grade IV for VTI grade in differentiating MLNs from CLNs, whereas those of SWV were 57.89%, 86.96%, 68.85%, and 0.752, respectively, at a cutoff level of 2.76\xe2\x80\x8am/s.The diagnostic performance of VTI grade was significantly higher than that of SWV in differentiating MLNs from CLNs. The diagnostic performance of VTI grade and SWV were lower intermediate in differentiating MLNs from BLLNs and in differentiating BLLNs from CLNs, and there was no significant difference between VTI grade and SWV. ARFI imaging may be a feasible method for differentiating MLNs from CLNs. labels: #Adult#Aged#Diagnosis, Differential#Elasticity Imaging Techniques#Female#Hematologic Neoplasms#Humans#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Diseases#Lymphatic Metastasis#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Grading#Ultrasonography#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of TRPC1 on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human airway in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).METHODS: A total of 94 patients who underwent lobectomy were selected and divided into COPD (49 cases) and control (45 cases) groups. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect expression of E-cadherin and vimentin and TRPC1. Correlation of TRPC1 expression with E-cadherin and vimentin expression, and correlations of lung function indicators in COPD patients with expression of TRPC1, E-cadherin, and vimentin were analyzed. Human airway epithelial cells (16HBE) were used for cell experiments; and cigarette smoking extract (CSE) was adopted to establish the COPD model using TRPC1 recombinant plasmids and siRNA. Cells were assigned into the control, CSE, CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8avector, CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8aTRPC1, CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8asi-NC, and CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8asi-TRPC1 groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were implemented to detect expression of TRPC1, E-cadherin, and vimentin.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, expression of TRPC1 and vimentin significantly increased while expression of E-cadherin decreased in the COPD group, and protein expression of TRPC1 was positively correlated with the protein expression of vimentin but negatively correlated with the protein expression of E-cadherin. Patients exhibiting positive expression of TRPC1 had lower FEV1, FEV1%Pred, and FEV1/FVC, compared with the patients exhibiting negative expression of TRPC1. Compared with the control group, expression of TRPC1 and vimentin increased, whereas expression of E-cadherin decreased in the CSE, CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8avector, CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8aTRPC1, and CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8asi-NC groups. Compared with the CSE and CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8avector groups, the expression of TRPC1 and vimentin increased but the expression of E-cadherin decreased in the CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8aTRPC1 group. Compared with the CSE and CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8asi-NC groups, the expression of TRPC1 and vimentin decreased but the expression of E-cadherin increased in the CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8asi-TRPC1 group. No significant differences were observed among the CSE, CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8avector and CSE\xe2\x80\x8a+\xe2\x80\x8asi-NC groups.CONCLUSION: Overexpression of TRPC1 in COPD promoted EMT process and TRPC1 may be a new and interesting focus for COPD new treatment in the future. labels: #Adult#Aged#Blotting, Western#Cadherins#Cells, Cultured#Epithelial Cells#Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition#Female#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Lung#Male#Middle Aged#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#TRPC Cation Channels#Vimentin'
b"RATIONALE: Renal complications in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were rarely observed, and proteinuria associated with AS can be seen often due to amyloidosis in this kind of complications, while membranous nephropathy (MN) is seldom considered. This article reports a case of coexistence of AS and MN, to provide the exact relationship of these 2 entities and recognized some causes of renal involvement in AS.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old female presented with pain of the left leg for 4 years and pedal edema for 2 weeks.DIAGNOSES: AS was diagnosed according to the patient's clinical manifestation and sacroiliitis observed on computed tomography (CT) scan. Nephrotic syndrome was found and MN was diagnosed according to kidney biopsy in which thickened capillary loops were observed with light microscopy, granular deposits of IgG along the capillary wall were observed using immunofluorescence staining, and subepithelial electron-dense deposits were observed with electron microscopy. No other secondary causes of MN were found on extensive investigations.INTERVENTION: Given the diagnoses, the patient received nonimmunosuppressive therapy for MN and adalimumab for AS.OUTCOMES: The patient got pain relief, as well as urinary protein reduction.LESSONS: This case suggested a secondary MN in association with AS and the relationship between these 2 diseases needed more concern and further illumination. labels: #Adalimumab#Adult#Celecoxib#Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors#Female#Glomerulonephritis, Membranous#Humans#Spondylitis, Ankylosing#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
b"The main objective of this study is to investigate the outcome between surgical procedures and the risk of development of hypoparathyroidism followed by surgical procedure in patients with thyroid disorders.We analyzed the data acquired from Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) research database from 1998 to 2011 and found 9316 patients with thyroid surgery. Cox regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR).A count of 314 cases (3.4%) of hypoparathyroidism was identified. The 9 years cumulated incidence of hypoparathyroidism was the highest in patient undergone bilateral total thyroidectomy (13.5%) and the lowest in the patient with unilateral subtotal thyroidectomy (1.2%). However, in the patients who had undergone unilateral subtotal, the risk was the highest in bilateral total (HR: 11.86), followed by radical thyroidectomy with unilateral neck lymph node dissection (HR: 8.56), unilateral total (HR, 4.39), and one side total and another side subtotal (HR: 2.80).The extent of thyroid resection determined the risk of development of hypoparathyroidism. It is suggested that the association of these factors is investigated in future studies. labels: #Humans#Hypoparathyroidism#Incidence#Lymph Node Excision#Postoperative Complications#Risk Factors#Taiwan#Thyroid Diseases#Thyroidectomy#Time Factors"
b'We compared the oncological outcomes of sphincter-saving resection (SSR) and abdominoperineal resection (APR) in 409 consecutive patients with very low rectal cancer (i.e., tumors within 3\xe2\x80\x8acm from the anal verge); 335 (81.9%) patients underwent APR and 74 (18.1%) underwent SSR. The APR group comprised higher proportions of men (67.5% vs 55.4%, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.049) and advanced-stage patients (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (PCRT) was more frequently administered in the SSR group (83.8% vs 52.8%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Overall, the systemic and local recurrence rates were 29.1% and 6.1%, respectively. On stratification according to PCRT and pathologic stage, the mode of surgery did not affect the recurrence type. Moreover, recurrence-free survival (RFS) did not differ according to the mode of surgery in different cancer stages. RFS was associated with ypT and ypN stages in patients who received PCRT, while pN stage, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement were risk factors for RFS in those who did not receive PCRT. Notably, SSR was not found to be a risk factor for RFS in either subgroup. Patients who were stratified according to cancer stage and PCRT also showed no differences in RFS according to the mode of surgery. Our results demonstrate that, regardless of PCRT administration, SSR is an effective treatment for very low rectal cancer, while CRM is an important prognostic factor for patients who did not receive PCRT. labels: #Anal Canal#Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic#Capecitabine#Chemoradiotherapy#Digestive System Surgical Procedures#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Fluorouracil#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Metastasis#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Neoplasm Staging#Perineum#Rectal Neoplasms#Rectum#Remission Induction#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b'RATIONALE: We report on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) by follow-up diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), and observed for approximately nine monthsby serial diffusion tensor tractography (DTT).PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old male patient was injured in a car crash. Approximately four weeks after the crash, he developed a tremor in the right hand and leg. His symptoms worsened over time.DIAGNOSES: Approximately six months after the crash, he developed a mild tremor in the left hand. Nine months after the crash, he manifested severe tremor in his right hand, mild resting and intentional tremor in his left hand and both legs, and mild trunkal ataxia.INTERVENTIONS: N/A.OUTCOMES: On 3-week DTT, well reconstructed DRTTs were observed in both hemispheres, except for the thinned lower portion of the right DRTT. On 9-month DTT, the right lower DRTT had thinned compared with the 3-week DTT and showed a disruption at the upper portion. The left DRTT showed thinning in the lower portion and tearing in the upper portion compared with 3-week DTT.LESSONS: Aggravation of an injured DRTT was demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI, using serial DTT examination. labels: #Accidents, Traffic#Aged#Ataxia#Brain Concussion#Cerebellar Nuclei#Diffusion Tensor Imaging#Efferent Pathways#Follow-Up Studies#Hand#Humans#Leg#Male#Thalamus#Tremor'
b"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prescription trend and pattern of oral antidiabetic (OAD) medications, which are extensively used worldwide for treating type 2 diabetes, in 2 age groups.In this population-based study, data obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan, were analyzed to investigate the prescription trend of all types of OAD medications during 2005 to 2012. We used descriptive statistics to demonstrate the trend of prescription patterns stratified by age (aged 65 years and above or younger than 65).Sulfonylurea (SU) was once the most commonly used drug, but the proportion of its prescription had declined gradually (76.83% in 2005 to 63.70% in 2012). Consequently, biguanide (BG) became the most commonly used drug since 2010 (64.31% in 2005 to 74.41% in 2012). In addition, the prescriptions of thiazolidinedione decreased significantly (9.20% in 2005 to 2.86% in 2012), whereas the usage of DPP-4 inhibitor increased with time (3.73% in 2009 to 19.64% in 2012). The treatment choice of SU and \xce\xb1-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) was higher in elderly patients compared with the younger population (SU: 62.70% in 2012, AGI: 12.78% in 2012). Two-drug combination therapies were the prevalent treatment choices for patients with type 2 diabetes (44.77% in 2012), particularly in the elderly group; however, \xe2\x89\xa53 drug combination therapies increased gradually during the study period, particularly in the younger group.This descriptive study presents the change in the prescription of OAD medication for different age groups during 2005 to 2012. labels: #Administration, Oral#Age Factors#Aged#Biguanides#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors#Drug Therapy, Combination#Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors#Humans#Hypoglycemic Agents#Middle Aged#Practice Patterns, Physicians'#Sulfonylurea Compounds#Taiwan#Thiazolidinediones"
b'Interleukin (IL)-27, one of cytokines in the IL-12 family, is considered to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. However, blood IL-27 levels in coronary artery disease (CAD) have not been fully elucidated yet. This cross-sectional study was done to elucidate the association between blood IL-27 levels and CAD.We investigated plasma IL-27 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in 274 consecutive patients who underwent elective coronary angiography for suspected CAD. CAD was present in 177 patients [30 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 147 stable CAD]. Compared with 97 patients without CAD, 177 patients with CAD had higher IL-27 (median 0.26 vs 0.22\xe2\x80\x8ang/mL, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05) and higher hsCRP (0.98 vs 0.41\xe2\x80\x8amg/L, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) levels. However, there was no significant difference in IL-27 levels among 3 groups of ACS, stable CAD, and CAD(-) (0.26, 0.25, and 0.22\xe2\x80\x8ang/mL), whereas hsCRP levels were significantly higher in ACS and stable CAD than in CAD(-) (2.09, 0.91 vs 0.41\xe2\x80\x8amg/L, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and were highest in ACS. IL-27 levels tended to increase with the number of>50% stenotic coronary vessels: 0.22 in CAD(-), 0.22 in 1-vessel disease, 0.31 in 2-vessel disease, and 0.27\xe2\x80\x8ang/mL in 3-vessel disease (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05). A stepwise increase in hsCRP levels was also found: 0.41 in CAD(-), 0.75 in 1-vessel, 1.05 in 2-vessel, and 1.85\xe2\x80\x8amg/L in 3-vessel disease (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Plasma hsCRP levels significantly (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.35), but IL-27 levels weakly (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.15), correlated with the number of stenotic coronary segments. In multivariate analysis, both IL-27 and hsCRP levels were independent factors associated with CAD. However, hsCRP, but not IL-27, was also a factor for ACS.While plasma IL-27 levels were high in patients with CAD, these levels were an independent factor for only CAD, not ACS, and weakly correlated with the severity of CAD. Our results suggest that IL-27 is unlikely to be a good biomarker reflecting the severity of CAD or the presence of ACS, or to play a major role in the progression of CAD. labels: #Acute Coronary Syndrome#Aged#Biomarkers#C-Reactive Protein#Coronary Angiography#Coronary Artery Disease#Cross-Sectional Studies#Diabetes Complications#Disease Progression#Female#Humans#Hypertension#Inflammation#Interleukin-27#Male#Middle Aged#Severity of Illness Index'
b'RATIONALE: Abdominal apoplexy is a rare and fatal emergency event, which is coined as a comparison to the cerebrovascular apoplexy. The exact mechanism of abdominal apoplexy was unclear, but arteriosclerosis, hypertension, abdominal aneurysm, and other predisposing angiopathy were considered to be the main reasons of abdominal apoplexy. The development of the imaging technology gave us more opportunities to confirm the diagnosis of abdominal apoplexy. However, the diagnosis and identification of the bleeding sites still continued to be a challenge.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old man presented to the emergency department with chief complains of sudden severe abdominal pain.DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as abdominal apoplexy with 2 synchronous bleeding sites.INTERVENTIONS: Angiography confirmed diagnosis of abdominal apoplexy and revealed 2 synchronous bleeding sites in gastroduodenal artery (GDA) and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (IPDA). Transcatheter embolization was performed immediately.OUTCOMES: The patient recovered and was discharged very soon. Two months later, the patient totally recovered and the hematoma disappeared in the CT imaging.LESSONS: The reported case is rare, given the very low incidence of abdominal apoplexy with 2 synchronous bleeding sites in GDA and IPDA. The awareness of abdominal apoplexy was still the key point in the management of this disease. Quick diagnosis by the imaging and immediate embolization were very important for the treatment. labels: #Abdominal Pain#Arteries#Duodenum#Embolization, Therapeutic#Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Pancreas#Rupture, Spontaneous#Stomach'
b'The aim of this study was to investigate the association between urinary incontinence (UI) and peptic ulcer (PU) and how this is related to psychological stress in Korean women by analyzing the data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV (KNHANES).A nationally representative sample of data on 7475 Korean women \xe2\x89\xa519 years of age from the KNHANES 2008 to 2010 was included. Physician-diagnosed UI and PU were assessed using questionnaires and surveys. Psychological stress was assessed through a questionnaire using a 4-point Likert scale. Data were analyzed using logistic regression to determine the association between UI and PU according to the level of psychological stress perception.PU was found in 1.41% of the total population. Breaking this down by the existence of UI, PU was found in 3.5% of the population with UI, and 1.4% of the population without UI, which showed a significant difference. A statistically significant trend for increasing prevalence of UI and PU with increasing psychological stress perception levels was found among the study population. Multivariable logistic regression analyses for PU showed that UI was significantly associated with a higher probability of PU in an adjusted model, which means that members of the population with UI were more likely to have PU than those without UI. A higher level of psychological stress perception was also significantly associated with increased odds of PU in the adjusted model.UI could potentiate the development of PU through increasing levels of psychological stress perception. labels: #Adult#Female#Humans#Middle Aged#Nutrition Surveys#Peptic Ulcer#Prevalence#Republic of Korea#Risk Factors#Statistics as Topic#Stress, Psychological#Surveys and Questionnaires#Urinary Incontinence'
b"BACKGROUND: In the clinical setting, the dispersed practitioners' attention often leads to decreased competence in their performance. We aimed to investigate the effect of distracted practitioners on the quality of chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.METHODS: A randomized controlled crossover simulation study was conducted. Participants were recruited from among doctors, nurses, and paramedics working in a university tertiary hospital. The paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) was used as a tool for distracting participants. In the crossover design, each participant played 2 scenarios with a 20-minute time gap, by a random order; 2-minute continuous chest compressions with and without PASAT being conducted. The primary outcome was the percentage of compression with an adequate compression rate. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of compression with adequate depth, the percentage of compression with full chest wall recoil, mean compression rate (per minute), mean compression depth, and subjective difficulty of chest compression.RESULTS: Forty-four participants were enrolled, and all of them completed the study. It was found that the percentage of compression with an adequate compression rate was lower when the PASAT was conducted. Although there was no difference in the percentage of compression with adequate depth (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.88), the percentage of compression with complete chest recoil was lower when PASAT was conducted. In addition, while the mean compression rate was higher when PASAT was conducted, the mean compression depth was not significantly different (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.65). The subjective difficulty was not different (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.69).CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers who are distracted have a negative effect on the quality of chest compression, in terms of its rate and chest wall recoil.TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03124290. labels: #Adult#Attentional Bias#Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation#Female#Health Personnel#Humans#Male#Manikins#Outcome Assessment (Health Care)#Professional Competence#Professionalism#Quality Improvement#Task Performance and Analysis#Time Factors#Work Performance#Workplace"
b'The aim of this study was to investigate the osteoporosis prevalence and the risks of postmenopausal women and elderly men in Gansu province.This cross-sectional study involved 3359 postmenopausal women and 3205 elderly males who were randomly selected from 7 areas in Gansu province. Areal bone mineral density (BMD) (g/cm) was measured at the distal one-third radius of the nonstressed forearm using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA: Osteometer MediTech). Factors related to osteoporosis were analyzed.The prevalence of osteoporosis in the entire study population was 9.65% for postmenopausal women and 8.08% for elderly males by WHO criteria, while the rate of osteopenia were 27.09% for postmenopausal women and 26.68% for elderly males. Risk of osteoporosis was significantly associated with age, menopause age, duration of menopause, body mass index (BMI), educational level, and alcohol consumption in postmenopausal women. In elderly men, age, BMI, current smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and sun exposure were associated with osteoporosis. The bone turnover markers osteocalcin (OC) and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptides of type I collagen (\xce\xb2-CTX) were inversely correlated with BMD in both genders; serum P and 25(OH)D found no significant correlation with BMD. Serum Ca showed a positive effect on BMD in elderly men only.The osteoporosis prevalence of postmenopausal women and the men aged over 60 years in Gansu province is presented. Risk of osteoporosis was significantly associated with age, menopause age, year since menopause, BMI, and educational level in postmenopausal women. In elderly men, age, BMI, and current smoking were associated with osteoporosis. This study also found that higher OC and \xce\xb2-CTX level were associated with lower BMD. Poor 25(OH)D, Ca, P status were not associated with an increased risk of low BMD. labels: #Absorptiometry, Photon#Aged#Biomarkers#Bone Density#China#Collagen Type I#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Life Style#Male#Middle Aged#Osteocalcin#Osteoporosis#Peptides#Postmenopause#Prevalence#Random Allocation#Risk Factors'
b'The aim of this study was to identify clinical signs and symptoms of ovarian torsion (OT) in children and to develop a simple predictive score.A chart review of patients with acute adnexal pathologies treated at the University Children\'s Hospital Basel, Switzerland, between March 2006 and June 2015 was performed. Medical records were screened for demographic and clinical data. These included clinical symptoms, laboratory studies, imaging, and type of treatment. The diagnosis OT was defined as intraoperative visualization of the torsed ovary around its pedicle at least 360 degrees. Variables predictive for OT were identified and the following score for the likelihood of having OT was developed: age (points\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8anumber of years) minus 3 points (if vomitus\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a"yes") and plus 1 point (if "pain duration>12 hours").A total of 80 patients with acute adnexal pathologies were identified. OT was recorded in 17 (21%) cases and ovarian cysts (OC) only in 63 (79%) cases. Patients who presented with OT were significantly younger than patients with OC only (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Correspondingly, 11 (65%) of the patients with OT had no menarche compared to 3 (5%) patients with OC only (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Vomiting (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001), a shorter pain duration (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.01), and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.01) were observed significantly more often in patients with OT. The sensitivity of a positive OT score was 0.81 and increased to 1.00 if restricted to girls between 2 to 12 years of age.The presence of vomiting, short duration of abdominal pain, and elevated CRP level have a predictive value for the diagnosis of OT. In these patients, an exploratory laparoscopy should be conducted without delay. The presented OT score appears to be a helpful tool in diagnosing OT in children. labels: #Abdominal Pain#Adolescent#C-Reactive Protein#Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Humans#Laparoscopy#Ovarian Diseases#Ovary#Predictive Value of Tests#Research Design#Risk Assessment#Risk Factors#Sensitivity and Specificity#Switzerland#Symptom Assessment#Torsion Abnormality#Vomiting'
b"The relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery remains uncertain. A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate the impact of pre-S deletions, T1762/A1764, and A1896 mutations on prognosis of HCC after curative resection. A total of 113 patients with positive serum HBV DNA (>200\xe2\x80\x8aIU/mL) who had underwent curative resection of pathologically proven HCC were recruited to determine the risk factors affecting the prognosis.The median follow-up time was 36.5 months and recurrence was detected in 67 patients (59.3%). The cumulative recurrence rates and overall survival rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-year after curative resection were 18.0%, 49.7%, 70.3%, and 93.7%, 61.0%, 42.5%, respectively. Patients with pre-S deletions showed significantly higher recurrence rates compared with those with wild type infection (HR: 1.822, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.018), but not related with a significantly poor survival (HR: 1.388, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.235). Subgroup analysis indicated that the patients with type III deletion had significant higher tumor recurrence rates than other deletion types (HR: 2.211, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.008-4.846, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.048). Multivariate analysis revealed that pre-S deletion, tumor size>3\xe2\x80\x8acm in diameter, and the presence of microvascular invasion were independent risk factors for tumor recurrence. HBV pre-S deletions were found to be clustered primarily in the 5' end of pre-S2 region and were more often found between amino acids 120 and 142 of the pre-S2 domain. The domains most frequently potentially involved were the transactivator domain in pre-S2 and polymerized human serum albumin binding site.Our cohort showed that pre-S deletions at the time of resection could predict tumor recurrence in HCC patients after curative resection. labels: #Adult#Aged#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#China#Cohort Studies#DNA, Viral#Female#Hepatectomy#Hepatitis B#Hepatitis B virus#Humans#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Sequence Deletion#Statistics as Topic#Survival Analysis"
b'An adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is generally caused by postoperative adhesions and is more frequently associated with colorectal surgeries than other procedures. We compared the outcomes of operative and conservative management of ASBO after primary colorectal cancer surgery.We retrospectively reviewed 5060 patients who underwent curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer; 388 of these patients (7.7%) were readmitted with a diagnosis of SBO. We analyzed the clinical course of these patients with reference to the cause of their surgery.Of the 388 SBO patients analyzed, 170 were diagnosed with ASBO. Their 3-, 5-, and 7-year recurrence-free survival rates were 86.1%, 72.8%, and 61.5%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 59.2 months. Repeated conservative management for ASBO without surgical management led to higher recurrence rates: 21.0% after the first admission, 41.7% after the second, 60.0% after the third, and 100% after the fourth (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.006). Surgical management was needed for 19.2%, 22.2%, 50%, and 66.7% of patients admitted with ASBO on the first to fourth hospitalizations, respectively. Repeated hospitalization for obstruction led to a greater possibility of surgical management (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Of 27 patients with surgical management at the first admission, 6 (17.6%) were readmitted with a diagnosis of SBO, but there were no further episodes of SBO in the surgically managed patients.Patients who undergo operative management for ASBO have a reduced risk of recurrence requiring hospitalization, whereas those with repeated conservative management have an increased risk of recurrence and require operative management. Operative management should be considered for recurrent SBO. labels: #Adult#Aged#Colorectal Neoplasms#Conservative Treatment#Digestive System Surgical Procedures#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Humans#Intestinal Obstruction#Intestine, Small#Long Term Adverse Effects#Male#Middle Aged#Reoperation#Republic of Korea#Retrospective Studies#Risk Assessment#Tissue Adhesions'
b'BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The approach to small bowel preparation before capsule endoscopy (CE) is still suboptimal.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups. Patients in Group A took 250\xe2\x80\x8amL 20% mannitol and 1\xe2\x80\x8aL 0.9% saline orally at 05:00\xe2\x80\x8ahours on the day of the procedure. In Group B the same preparation was taken at 20:00 on the day before, and at 05:00 on the day of CE; in addition, 20\xe2\x80\x8amL oral simethicone was taken 30\xe2\x80\x8aminutes before CE. Group C was treated identically to Group B, except that the patients fasted for 3 days and took 3\xe2\x80\x8ag senna orally 3 times daily before CE. The length of bowel containing green luminal contents was assessed by ImageJ software and bowel cleanliness was evaluated by computed assessment of the cleansing score.RESULTS: Cleansing of the whole small bowel and the distal small bowel were significantly different between the 3 groups (\xcf\x87\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a22.470, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000; \xcf\x87\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a17.029, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000, respectively). There were also significant differences between the 3 groups in the length of small bowel and specifically the length of the distal small bowel containing green luminal contents (\xcf\x87\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a12.390, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000, \xcf\x87\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a15.141, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.000, respectively), but not with regard to the proximal small bowel (\xcf\x87\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.678, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.509).CONCLUSIONS: Three days fasting and oral senna, combined with 20% mannitol and simethicone, before CE, can reduce the effects of bile on the small bowel and improve small bowel cleansing, especially in the distal small intestine. labels: #Administration, Oral#Adult#Aged#Capsule Endoscopy#Cathartics#Drug Administration Schedule#Fasting#Female#Gastrointestinal Diseases#Humans#Intestine, Small#Male#Mannitol#Middle Aged#Patient Care Planning#Senna Extract#Simethicone#Treatment Outcome'
b'RATIONALE: Pes anserine (PA) bursitis is an inflammatory condition of the medial knee. The PA bursa becomes more painful when infected, damaged, or irritated. Although various treatment options have been attempted to treat PA bursitis, optimal treatments are still debated. This study aims to investigate the effect of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) injection on reducing pain and inflammation in a patient presenting with PA bursitis.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 50-year-old female patient was admitted to our pain clinic with symptoms of tenderness and pain over the medial knee. Physical examination revealed the pain to be located over the proximal medial tibia at the insertion of the conjoined tendons of the PA. The knee had lost its range of movement and strength, and resisted knee flexion.DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed as having PA bursitis.INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound guided PA bursa injection was carried out.OUTCOMES: Follow-up for the patient was more than eight months. She showed good improvement in PA bursitis without any complications.LESSONS: This is the first successful report of successful PDRN injection for PA bursa. labels: #Analgesics#Anti-Inflammatory Agents#Arthralgia#Bursa, Synovial#Bursitis#Female#Humans#Injections#Knee Joint#Middle Aged#Polydeoxyribonucleotides#Treatment Outcome#Ultrasonography'
b'The aim of the study is to describe the clinical characteristics and prognosis of malignant transformation of adenomyosis in patients with endometrial cancer.In this retrospective descriptive study, the clinical data of patients with endometrial cancer (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a127) who were admitted at our hospital between January 2006 and December 2013 were evaluated.Among the 127 patients with endometrial cancer, 24 patients had endometrial cancer concurrently with adenomyosis. Among these 24 patients, 3 were diagnosed with malignant transformation of adenomyosis. Postoperative pathological investigations in the cancer+adenomyosis group revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma of Grade I (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a21) and II (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a3). The patients with malignant transformation of adenomyosis were relatively younger than the other patients. In those 3 patients, both the estrogen and progesterone receptors were strongly expressed in eutopic endometrium and were weakly positive in ectopic endometrium.Although adenomyosis is usually benign, it might also be a precursor of malignant disease. As the incidence of adenomyosis malignant transformation is low, and its clinical manifestations are nonspecific, it may only be confirmed by postoperative pathological examination. Further investigations on larger sample size may provide additional data about prognosis of adenomyosis malignant transformation. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Adenomyosis#Adult#Age Factors#Cell Transformation, Neoplastic#China#Choristoma#Endometrial Neoplasms#Endometrium#Female#Humans#Hysterectomy#Incidence#Middle Aged#Myometrium#Neoplasm Grading#Receptors, Estrogen#Receptors, Progesterone#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors'
b'RATIONALE: Thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is usually attributed to impaired marrow production resulting from cytotoxic drug use or CMML itself ("CMML-induced thrombocytopenia"). In very rare cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be a complication of CMML ("CMML-associated ITP"). However, treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with CMML is still a challenge.PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1 was a 61-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital because of skin petechiae and purpura for 6 days. She had increased monocyte cell count (1.82\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8a10/L), markedly decreased platelet count (2\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8a10/L), hypercellularity of the megakaryocyte lineage with many immature megakaryocytes, and ZRSR2(zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2) mutation. She failed to the treatment of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), TPO (thrombopoietin), and cyclosporin A (CsA). Case 2 was a 72-year-old female patient with thrombocytosis and monocytosis for 4 years, and thrombocytopenia for 6 months. After 10 courses of decitabine therapy, she had a persistent severe thrombocytopenia and decreased number of megakaryocytes, TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) and SRSF2 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) mutations were detected. She was dependent on platelet transfusion.DIAGNOSES: Case 1 was diagnosed as CMML-associated ITP, and case 2 as CMML with decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia.INTERVENTIONS: Both patients were treated with eltrombopag.OUTCOMES: In both patients, the platelet counts returned to the normal within 1 week after eltrombopag therapy. The platelet count in case 1 patient remained stable at 141-200\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8a10/L for 20 months with stopping therapy for 3 months. In case 2 patient, eltrombopag was stopped 1 month later. Her platelet count decreased to 41\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8a10/L, but was stable at \xe2\x88\xbc30\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8a10/L for 3 months with platelet transfusion independency for 12 months. Both patients had no adverse effects with eltrombopag.LESSONS: CMML-associated ITP is very rare and easily misdiagnosed. To the best of our knowledge, case 1 is the first reported case of the successful treatment of CMML-associated ITP with eltrombopag. Both CMML-associated ITP and decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in these 2 patients were highly sensitive and safe to eltrombopag therapy. labels: #Aged#Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic#Azacitidine#Benzoates#DNA-Binding Proteins#Drug Monitoring#Female#Hematologic Agents#Humans#Hydrazines#Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic#Middle Aged#Mutation#Nuclear Proteins#Platelet Count#Proto-Oncogene Proteins#Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic#Pyrazoles#Ribonucleoproteins#Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors#Thrombocytopenia#Thrombopoietin#Treatment Outcome'
b'The CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 scores are well-known predictors of stroke caused by atrial fibrillation (AF), but no studies have evaluated their use for stratifying all-cause mortality risk in patients discharged for systolic heart failure (SHF) with or without AF.This study analyzed data in the Taiwan Society of Cardiology-heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (TSOC-HFrEF) registry. These data were obtained by a prospective, multicenter, observational survey of patients treated at 21 medical centers in Taiwan after hospitalization for acute, pre-existing or new onset SHF from May, 2013 to October, 2014. During 1 year follow-up, 198 patients were lost follow-up, and final 1311 (86.8%) patients were included for further analysis. During the follow-up period, 250 (19%) patients died. Multivariate analysis revealed that body mass index, thyroid disorder, valvular surgery history, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and scores for CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 were significant independent predictors of mortality in the overall population of SHF patients (all P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05) The c-indexes showed that CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 scores were significantly associated with mortality in SHF patients with or without AF (all P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a005). However, R2CHADS2 had significantly higher accuracy in predicting mortality in all SHF patients compared with CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc (DeLong test, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.0001), especially in SHF without AF (DeLong test, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0003).Scores for CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 can be used to predict 1-year all-cause mortality in SHF patients with or without AF. For predicting all-cause mortality in SHF patients, R2CHADS2 is more accurate than CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc. labels: #Aged#Atrial Fibrillation#Female#Heart Failure, Systolic#Hospitalization#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Mortality#Predictive Value of Tests#Prospective Studies#Registries#Research Design#Risk Assessment#Risk Factors#Taiwan'
b'INTRODUCTION: We report a 39-year-old male patient with a fracture of the right acetabulum undergoing open reduction and internal fixation with a plate under general anesthesia. At closure, the surgeons injected 0.75% ropivacaine into the subcutaneous tissue of the incision wound for postoperative analgesia. Soon after injection, subcutaneous emphysema at the injection site and a sudden decrease in end-tidal CO2 tension with crude oscillatory ripples during the alveolar plateau phase were observed. Shortly thereafter, it was found that the surgeons had mistakenly injected hydrogen peroxide instead of ropivacaine. Fortunately, the patient recovered to normal status after 10 minutes. After the surgery, the patient was carefully observed for suspected pulmonary embolism and discharged without complications.CONCLUSION: Adverse events related to medication errors can occur in operating rooms, and most cases can be prevented through communication and verification by medical staff. The use of hydrogen peroxide should be reevaluated; when used, medical staff should be aware of the risk of oxygen embolism and take extreme care. labels: #Acetabulum#Adult#Anesthesia, General#Anti-Infective Agents, Local#Embolism, Air#Fracture Fixation#Fractures, Bone#Humans#Hydrogen Peroxide#Injections, Subcutaneous#Intraoperative Complications#Male#Medication Errors#Oxygen#Subcutaneous Emphysema#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Vandetanib is a promising anticancer target agent for treating advanced carcinomas, such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer. Rash is a frequently reported adverse event of vandetanib. We conducted this meta-analysis to determine the incidence rate and overall risks of all-grade and high-grade rash with vandetanib in NSCLC patients.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to identify studies with vandetanib and rash in NSCLC patients. Data were extracted to calculate the pooled incidence of all-grade and high-grade (grade \xe2\x89\xa53) rash caused by vandetanib treatment.RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials involving 4893 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The overall incidence of all-grade and high-grade rash caused by vandetanib treatment was 46% (95% CI: 37.1%, 54.8%), and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.4%, 5.1%), respectively. The risk ratios (RR) of all-grade and high-grade rash for vandetanib treatment versus control treatment were 2.35 (95% CI: 1.20, 4.61; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and 4.68 (95% CI 1.42, 15.37; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that the increased risk of all-grade rash was clear across all subgroups, including first-line/second-line therapy, phase 2/phase 3 trial, sample size</>200, a dosage of 100 or 300\xe2\x80\x8amg, and monotherapy/combination therapy. However, for the high-grade rash, vandetanib did not increase the risk of rash when it was used in first-line therapy, or in a phase II trial, or in a trial with sample size<200.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that vandetanib was associated with a significantly increased risk of rash. Therefore, early recognition and appropriate monitoring should be taken when NSCLC patients were treated with vandetanib. labels: #Antineoplastic Agents#Carcinoma#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Exanthema#Humans#Incidence#Inflammatory Breast Neoplasms#Neoplasm Staging#Piperidines#Quinazolines#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Severity of Illness Index'
b'Glaucoma (GL) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are diseases of significant social importance. Cardiovascular disorders such as systemic hypertension, hypotension, increased blood viscosity, vasospasm, and diabetes are potential risk factors of GL, especially when intraocular pressure is not elevated. Only a few studies have reported a possible connection between cardiac arrhythmias and GL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of GL in patients with AF.A total of 117 patients were included in the study, 79 with AF (AF group) and 38 with sinus rhythm (Control group), matched for age and sex. The mean\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8astandard deviation age was 73.6\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a7.2 and 71.6\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a4.7 years for the AF and control groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of systemic hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, or vascular disease between the groups. Patients were examined for the presence of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) by an ophthalmologist.NTG was confirmed in 40 patients (34.2%) in the entire group, with 35 (44.3%) in the AF group and 5 (13.15%) in the Control group. The incidence of NTG was significantly higher in the AF group (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0221). Women represented 60% of GL patients in the AF group and 80% in the control group. There were no significant differences in intraocular pressure between the groups (mean\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8astandard deviation, 14.3\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a2.3 vs. 14.2\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a2.8\xe2\x80\x8ammHg, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.4202). Approximately three-fourths of patients with AF and NTG had early visual field damage based on the Hodapp classification.AF, independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors, increases the risk of developing NTG. Many AF patients do not have conspicuous symptoms of GL, so understanding the possible risk of its development is critical because early detection might help to prevent later visual impairment and even irreversible blindness. labels: #Aged#Atrial Fibrillation#Early Diagnosis#Early Medical Intervention#Female#Humans#Intraocular Pressure#Low Tension Glaucoma#Male#Poland#Risk Assessment#Risk Factors#Statistics as Topic#Tonometry, Ocular#Vision Disorders'
b'RATIONALE: Post-therapy or diagnostic whole-body radioiodine scintigraphy is widely employed to evaluate the residual, recurrence, or metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma because of the high sensitivity and accuracy. However, it has pitfalls.PATIENT CONCERNS: We described a 63-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma who was referred for iodine-131 ablation therapy. The post-therapy iodine-131 whole-body images demonstrated abnormal increased uptake of the tracer in the regions of bilateral upper abdomen.DIAGNOSES: The single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) showed the abnormal Iactivity was corresponded to multiple irregular cystic low densities in the both kidneys on the low-dose computed tomography images, so the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease was confirmed.INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient responded well to the lifestyle-based treatments.LESSONS: Polycystic kidney disease was one of the etiologies of the false-positive findings in the radioiodine scintigraphy. labels: #Carcinoma, Papillary#Humans#Incidental Findings#Iodine Radioisotopes#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Metastasis#Polycystic Kidney Diseases#Radioimmunotherapy#Radiopharmaceuticals#Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography#Thyroid Neoplasms#Whole Body Imaging'
b'We investigated the serum haptoglobin levels in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) based on the hypothesis that haptoglobin levels would reflect subclinical hemolysis due to microangiopathy in pulmonary arterioles.This cross-sectional study included 3 groups of patients attending Hokkaido University Hospital: PAH, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and connective tissue diseases (CTD) without PAH (CTD-non-PAH) group. Serum haptoglobin levels were measured by standardized turbidimetric immunoassay in all patients. Demographic data, laboratory results, right heart catheter, and echocardiographic findings were extracted from the medical records. Decreased haptoglobin levels were defined as below 19\xe2\x80\x8amg/dL based on the 95th percentile of healthy controls.Thirty-five patients in PAH group including 11 with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and 24 with CTD-associated PAH (CTD-PAH), 27 in CTEPH group, and 32 in CTD-non-PAH group were analyzed. Serum haptoglobin levels in PAH group (median 66\xe2\x80\x8amg/dL) were significantly lower than those in CTEPH group (median 94\xe2\x80\x8amg/dL, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.03) and CTD-non-PAH group (median 79\xe2\x80\x8amg/dL, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.03). The prevalence of decreased haptoglobin levels was 26% in PAH group, 15% in CTEPH group, and 6% in CTD-non-PAH group. Serum haptoglobin levels had a significant negative correlation (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a-0.66, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) with mean pulmonary artery pressure in PAH group, particularly in CTD-PAH subgroup (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a-0.74, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), but no correlation in IPAH subgroup (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a-0.52, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.13) and in CTEPH group (r\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a-0.17, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.41). Follow-up cases of CTD-PAH showed lowering pulmonary artery pressure led to normalizing serum haptoglobin levels.Serum haptoglobin levels decreased in PAH patients and inversely correlated with pulmonary artery pressure in CTD-PAH patients, suggesting their potential as a surrogate marker for CTD-PAH. labels: #Adult#Aged#Arterioles#Blood Pressure#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Haptoglobins#Hemolysis#Humans#Hypertension, Pulmonary#Lung#Male#Middle Aged#Pulmonary Artery#Pulmonary Embolism#Thrombotic Microangiopathies'
b'Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of small-diameter mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs) (diameter \xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x80\x8acm) are still unclear.This study focused on imaging findings of small mass-forming ICCs. The MRI findings for small-diameter mass-forming ICCs were summarized, and the enhancement features of small ICC nodules with different diameters [2 groups were defined: a smaller nodule group (ICC diameter<2\xe2\x80\x8acm) and a larger nodule group (ICC diameter>2\xe2\x80\x8acm)] were compared on contrast-enhanced MRI.In our study, there were 41 small ICC nodules in 41 patients, including 30 men and 11 women (average age, 56 years). The nodules were characterized by peripheral hyperintense in the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced MRI. In the different diameter groups, peripheral hyperintense was the most common in the larger nodule group (56% vs 12%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05) and hypointense was more common in the smaller nodule group (25% vs 0%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05) in the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced MRI. Smaller nodules mainly showed progressive enhancement, whereas larger nodules mainly showed peripheral continuous enhancement (56% vs 6%, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.05).The small-diameter mass-forming ICC nodules mainly show peripheral continuous enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI; however, those with diameters<2\xe2\x80\x8acm commonly show progressive enhancement. labels: #Adult#Bile Duct Neoplasms#Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic#Cholangiocarcinoma#Contrast Media#Diagnosis, Differential#Female#Humans#Image Enhancement#Liver#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Middle Aged#Radiologists#Retrospective Studies'
b'Intralesional steroid injections are the standard treatment for hypertrophic scars and keloids. The procedure is, however, quite painful and is unpopular with patients because of this. Topical application of anesthetic creams, such as Ametop gel (tetracaine) and EMLA cream (lidocaine and prilocaine), has limited efficacy because of poor drug penetration. The onset of the analgesic effect is also slow, which means that the use of topical anesthetics is time-consuming in clinical practice.We hypothesized that a commercially available cryotip could be used to provide fast-acting topical cryoanesthesia that would reduce the pain associated with steroid injections.Thirty patients with hypertrophic scars or keloids were enrolled in the study. Scars were injected with the steroid, triamcinolone acetonide, with or without prior application of the cryotip (-10\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb0C) for 15 seconds. The degree of pain was evaluated in each case using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the verbal descriptor scale (VDS), together with any side-effects caused by application of the cryotip.The VAS pain scores showed a statistically significant (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01) difference between the pretreated and the control scars (pain scores 7.87\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a1.31 and 2.7\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a1.37, respectively). The VDS pain scores also showed a statistically significant (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.01) difference between the pretreated and the control scars. And its average scores were 7.89\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.32 and 2.68\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.25, respectively.Application of the cryotip before injection could provide a rapid and effective means of reducing the pain associated with steroid injections.

b'It is still debatable whether complete mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) is associated with better survival than mediastinal lymph node sampling (MLNS) in surgical treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to assess the impact of lymph node dissection on long-term survival among stage I NSCLC patients.In this cohort study, 317 stage I NSCLC Chinese patients in Shanghai Chest Hospital were followed up for at least 10 years to evaluate the impact of different lymph node dissection modes on their survival. Among them, 161 patients were in the MLND group and 156 in the MLNS group. Overall survival and median survival times were calculated for the 2 groups. The association between lymph node dissection and the survival of NSCLC patients was assessed using Cox proportional-hazard models.Patients in the MLND group presented better survival (median survival time\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a154.67 months) than those in the MLNS group (median survival time\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a124.67 months). The MLNS had higher mortality than the MLND group, with the crude hazard ratio of the MLNS group relative to the MLND group as 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97, 1.78). After adjusting for age and sex, the association between lymph node dissection and mortality (hazard ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.00, 1.84) was statistically significant (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.047). Further adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, the association (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.02, 1.92) remained statistically significant (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.036). The association between lymph node dissection mode and mortality was strong among patients with tumor size between 2.0 and 3.0\xe2\x80\x8acm (hazard ratio 2.79, 95% CI 1.45, 5.37).We found that the MLND was associated with better survival for patients with early-stage NSCLC, compared with the MLNS. The effects of MLND on survival may depend on tumor size. Our findings have important implications in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC. Further prospective studies with a large sample size are needed to confirm our findings. labels: #Aged#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Disease-Free Survival#Female#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Lung Neoplasms#Lymph Node Excision#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Metastasis#Male#Mediastinum#Neoplasm Staging#Proportional Hazards Models#Treatment Outcome'
b"To determine the prevalence of thyroid disorders among newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and evaluate the association between clinical characteristics of RA and thyroid disorders, and also initial treatment response in the RA patients with thyroid disorders.Newly diagnosed, adult RA patients who were diagnosed according to the new 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria since January 1, 2010, were included. Patients' demographic data, serology results including immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor (IgM RF), anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP), and antinuclear antibody (ANA), and also disease activity score in 28 joints-C-reactive protein at the time of diagnosis and after 4 months (\xc2\xb11-2 months) of treatment initiation were extracted from Danish Danbio Registry. Patients' electronic hospital records for the past 10 years were reviewed to reveal if they had been diagnosed with thyroid disorders or they had abnormal thyroid test.In all, 439 patients were included, female 60.1%, mean age 64.6\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a15.0 years and disease duration 2.6\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a1.7 years. Prevalence of thyroid disorders was 69/439 (15.7%) and hypothyroidism was the most frequent disorder (30.4%). The presence of thyroid disorders among RA patients was significantly associated with female sex (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), ANA positivity (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.04), and anti-CCP \xe2\x89\xa5100\xe2\x80\x8aEU/mL (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.05). Furthermore, RA patients with thyroid disorders had significantly poorer initial response to RA treatment compared with patients with isolated RA after 4 months of treatment (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.02). There were no associations between thyroid disorders and age, disease duration, and also IgM RF positivity.Presence of thyroid disorders in RA patients is suggestive of a more aggressive disease and poor outcome, with direct effect on initial treatment response. To diagnose concurrent thyroid disorders at an earlier stage, routine measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone is recommended in all RA patients at the time of diagnosis and with yearly interval thereafter. labels: #Aged#Antibodies, Antinuclear#Antirheumatic Agents#Arthritis, Rheumatoid#Autoantibodies#C-Reactive Protein#Cohort Studies#Denmark#Female#Humans#Immunoglobulin M#Joints#Male#Middle Aged#Peptides, Cyclic#Prevalence#Registries#Rheumatoid Factor#Severity of Illness Index#Thyroid Diseases#Treatment Outcome"
b'RATIONALE: Acute colonic diverticulitis is a well-known surgical emergency, which occurs in about 10 percent of patients known for diverticulosis.PATIENT CONCERNS: The case of a 77-year-old woman is reported, with past history of abdominoperineal resection with end-colostomy for low rectal adenocarcinoma, and who developed an acute colonic diverticulitis in a subcutaneous portion of colostomy with parastomal phlegmon.DIAGNOSES: Initial computed tomography imaging demonstrated a significant submucosal parietal edema with local fat tissues infiltration in regard of 3 diverticula.INTERVENTIONS: A two-step treatment was decided: first a nonoperative treatment was initiated with 2 weeks antibiotics administration, followed by, 6 weeks after, a segmental resection of the terminal portion of the colon with redo of a new colostomy by direct open approach.OUTCOMES: Patient was discharged on the second postoperative day without complications. Follow-up at 2 weeks revealed centimetric dehiscence of the stoma, which was managed conservatively until sixth postoperative week by stomatherapists.LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: Treatment of acute diverticulitis with parastomal phlegmon in a patient with end-colostomy could primary be nonoperative. Delayed surgical treatment with segmental colonic resection was proposed to avoid recurrence and potential associated complications. labels: #Abdominal Neoplasms#Aged#Anus Neoplasms#Cellulitis#Colostomy#Diverticulitis, Colonic#Female#Humans#Perineum#Postoperative Complications#Surgical Stomas'
b'This study is conducted to investigate the involvement of T-helper (Th) cells and regulatory T cells in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).The percentages of Th22, Th17, Th1, and regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of EOC patients, benign ovarian epithelial neoplasm (BOEN) patients, and healthy control (HC) were examined by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum levels of interleukin (IL)-22, IL-17, interferon-\xce\xb3 (IFN-\xce\xb3), and tumor necrosis factor-\xce\xb1 (TNF-\xce\xb1).Th22 and Th17 were significantly increased in EOC patients. The plasma concentrations of IL-22 and TNF-\xce\xb1 were significantly elevated in EOC patients compared with BOEN patients and HC. In EOC patients, there was an increased trend of Th22, IL-22, and TNF-\xce\xb1 in stage III-IV patients compared with stage I-II patients. A positive correlation was seen among Th22, Th17, and Th1 cells in EOC patients. Similarly, positive correlations were detected between Th22 cells and IL-22 or TNF-\xce\xb1 and between Th1 cells and interferon-\xce\xb3 (IFN-\xce\xb3) in EOC patients. Besides, no significant difference was found in Th1 cells and regulatory T cells among EOC and BOEN patients and HC.There is a higher circulating frequency of Th22, Th17 cells, IL-22, and TNF-\xce\xb1 concentration in EOC patients, which may conjointly participate in the pathogenesis and growth of EOC. labels: #Adult#Aged#Case-Control Studies#Cytokines#Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay#Female#Humans#Lymphocyte Count#Middle Aged#Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial#Ovarian Neoplasms#T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer#T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory'
b'RATIONALE: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a multisystemic, progressive disease of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent inflammation and progressive cartilage destruction. It can involve all types of cartilage including ears and nose, tracheobronchial tree, joints, and any other tissue rich in proteoglycans such as heart, eyes, and blood vessels. Recurrent chondritis can be life-threatening if the respiratory tract, heart valves, or blood vessels are affected. To date there is no data in the literature on the post solid organ transplantation RP.PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a 59-year-old male liver transplant recipient with primary sclerosing cholangitis who developed RP of the earlobes and nose despite post-transplant immunosuppression.DIAGNOSES: Based on the clinical criteria, scintigraphy and biopsy from the left auricle his condition was diagnosed as RP.INTERVENTIONS: Pulses of methylprednisolone followed by high-dose oral steroids along with azathioprine were administered.OUTCOMES: Such therapy diminished local cartilage inflammation, improved patient\'s general condition and the laboratory results. Significant loss of ear cartilage and characteristic "saddlenose" were observed after remission of acute symptoms. The control scintigraphy proved very good treatment response.LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the RP in liver transplant recipient. Based on our patient presentation, we suggest that RP should be suspected in any transplant recipient with cartilage inflammation, and that the Michet\'s clinical criteria and scintigraphy seem to be the best diagnostic tools for solid organ transplant recipients suspected of RP. labels: #Cholangitis, Sclerosing#Ear Cartilage#Ear Diseases#Humans#Liver Transplantation#Male#Middle Aged#Nasal Cartilages#Nose Diseases#Polychondritis, Relapsing'
b'The aims of present study were to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and prognostic significance of masked hypertension in diabetic patients. Using a cross-sectional design, 266 patients with documented type 2 diabetes mellitus and clinic blood pressure (BP)<140/90\xe2\x80\x8amm Hg without antihypertension treatment were enrolled; 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was applied to evaluate mean 24-hour systolic/diastolic BP. Demographics, medical histories, and medications usage were obtained using questionnaire. Fasting venous blood was drawn for biochemical analysis. Approximately 26.5% of participants were diagnosed as masked hypertension with mean 24-hour systolic BP>130\xe2\x80\x8amm Hg and/or mean 24-hour diastolic BP>80\xe2\x80\x8amm Hg. Compared with those without masked hypertension, other than significantly higher mean 24-hour systolic/diastolic BP, patients with masked hypertension were more elderly, had higher serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and higher prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Multivariate regression analysis showed that aging, increased HbA1c and CRP levels, and prevalent CHD were independently associated with masked hypertension. Logistic regression analysis revealed that after adjusted for traditional risk factors including age, male sex, smoking status, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, CRP, clinic systolic BP, and HbA1c, masked hypertension remained independently associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), with odds ratio of 1.31 and 95% confidence interval of 1.11 to 1.85. In summary, in diabetic patients, concurrent masked hypertension increases the odds of having CVD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to investigate whether screening and managing masked hypertension could reduce cardiovascular events in diabetic patients. labels: #Aged#Blood Pressure#C-Reactive Protein#Coronary Disease#Cross-Sectional Studies#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Female#Glycated Hemoglobin A#Humans#Lipoproteins, LDL#Male#Masked Hypertension#Middle Aged#Prevalence#Prognosis#Risk Factors'
b'Walking up and down stairs is a common and important activity of daily living. Women with fibromyalgia often show a reduced ability to perform this task.The objective of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of stair negotiation tasks and to assess the impact of fibromyalgia symptoms on the ability to negotiate stairs.Forty-two women with fibromyalgia participated in this descriptive correlational study. The relevance of the stair negotiation (both walking up and down) was evaluated by assessing its association with the revised version of the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ-R) and other health-related variables. Test-retest reliability was also analyzed. The main outcome measures were time spent walking up and down stairs and impact of fibromyalgia, quality of life, number of falls, weight, and lower limb strength and endurance.The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for stair descent was 0.929 whereas that for ascent was 0.972. The score in these tests correlated significantly with the total score for the FIQ-R and the score for many of dimensions and symptoms: that is, physical function, overall impact of fibromyalgia, pain, energy, stiffness, restorative sleep, tenderness, self-perceived balance problems, and sensitivity.Given the importance of the stair negotiation as activity of daily living and the high reliability, both stair ascent and descent tasks may be useful as outcome measures in studies on patients with fibromyalgia. labels: #Accidental Falls#Activities of Daily Living#Adult#Aged#Disability Evaluation#Female#Fibromyalgia#Humans#Lower Extremity#Middle Aged#Quality of Life#Reproducibility of Results#Statistics as Topic#Surveys and Questionnaires#Task Performance and Analysis#Walking'
b'Due to the lack of an accurate preoperative diagnostic method of central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the prophylaxis of central lymph node dissection remains controversial. The present study investigated the clinicopathological features of PTC patients and the risk factors of CLNM. The clinicopathological features of PTC patients with respect to sex, age, initial symptoms, observation, tumor diameter, multifocality, extrathyroidal invasion, and pathological data combined with other thyroid diseases, were analyzed retrospectively. The risk factors of CLNM were analyzed by Chi-squared test and multivariate logistic regression model. The CLNM rate of PTC was 40.6% (1331/3273). On average, 7.0 (4.0, 12.0) central lymph nodes were dissected, and 3.70 (\xc2\xb13.8) lymph nodes were proved to be metastatic. Univariate analysis showed that sex (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), age (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), tumor diameter (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), extrathyroid invasion (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), multifocality (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001), concurrent nodular goiter (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), initial symptoms (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), and observation or not (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) were related to CLNM. The observation time was neither related to CLNM (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.469) nor extrathyroidal invasion (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.137). Tumors localized in the lower part of the thyroid were the risk factors for CLNM (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001) while multifocality was unrelated (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.68). The metastasis rate of bilateral multiple regions\xe2\x80\x8a>\xe2\x80\x8aunilateral multiple regions\xe2\x80\x8a>\xe2\x80\x8asingle region (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.003). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex, age, tumor diameter, extrathyroidal invasion, and observation were independent risk factors of CLNM. Male, younger age, large tumor size, and extrathyroidal invasion were independent risk factors for CLNM. CLNM was related to multiple regions occupied by tumors in the thyroid but unrelated to multifocality. The tumor occupying a single region and localized in the lower part of thyroid could be used as a predictive factor for CLNM. For tumors that could not be diagnosed as benign or malignant, observation may be an option, since no evidence of disease progression was presented during observation. labels: #Adult#Age Factors#Carcinoma, Papillary#Chi-Square Distribution#Disease Progression#Female#Humans#Logistic Models#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Metastasis#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Neck#Neck Dissection#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sex Factors#Thyroid Neoplasms#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome#Watchful Waiting'
b'The objective of this study was to examine the incidence and hazard ratio (HR) of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with head and neck cancer in Taiwan.This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 2522 subjects aged 20 to 84 years with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer as the head and neck cancer group between 2000 and 2012, and 10,064 randomly selected sex- and age-matched subjects without any cancer as the noncancer group. The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis at the end of 2013 was estimated in both groups. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for pulmonary tuberculosis being associated with head and neck cancer.The overall incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis was 2.86-fold greater in the head and neck cancer group than that in the noncancer group (4.70 vs 1.64 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI, 2.53-3.24). After adjusting for confounding factors, the adjusted HR of pulmonary tuberculosis became 2.90 for the head and neck cancer group (95% CI, 2.11-3.99), compared with the noncancer group. In addition, male (adjusted HR 2.27, 95% CI, 1.29-4.00) and age (increase for 1 year, adjusted HR 1.06, 95% CI, 1.05-1.08) were associated with pulmonary tuberculosis.Head and neck cancer is significantly associated with 2.90-fold increased hazard of pulmonary tuberculosis in Taiwan, compared with the general population. labels: #Adult#Age Factors#Databases, Factual#Female#Head and Neck Neoplasms#Humans#Incidence#Male#Middle Aged#Proportional Hazards Models#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Sex Factors#Taiwan#Tuberculosis, Pulmonary'
b'Both genomics and environmental stressors play a significant role in increases in blood pressure (BP). In an attempt to further explain the hypertension (HTN) disparity among African Americans (AA), both genetic underpinnings (selected candidate genes) and stress due to perceived racial discrimination (as reported in the literature) have independently been linked to increased BP among AAs. Although Gene x Environment interactions on BP have been examined, the environmental component of these investigations has focused more on lifestyle behaviors such as smoking, diet, and physical activity, and less on psychosocial stressors such as perceived discrimination.The present study uses candidate gene analyses to identify the relationship between Everyday Discrimination (ED) and Major Life Discrimination (MLD) with increases in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) among AA in the Jackson Heart Study. Multiple linear regression models reveal no association between discrimination and BP after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), antihypertensive medication use, and current smoking status.Subsequent candidate gene analysis identified 5 SNPs (rs7602215, rs3771724, rs1006502, rs1791926, and rs2258119) that interacted with perceived discrimination and SBP, and 3 SNPs (rs2034454, rs7602215, and rs3771724) that interacted with perceived discrimination and DBP. Most notably, there was a significant SNP\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8adiscrimination interaction for 2 SNPs on the SLC4A5 gene: rs3771724 (MLD: SBP P = .034, DBP P = .031; ED: DBP: P = .016) and rs1006502 (MLD: SBP P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.034, DBP P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.030; ED: DBP P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.015).This study supports the idea that SNP\xe2\x80\x8a\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8adiscrimination interactions combine to influence clinically relevant traits such as BP. Replication with similar epidemiological samples is required to ascertain the role of genes and psychosocial stressors in the development and expression of high BP in this understudied population. labels: #Adult#African Americans#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Blood Pressure#Discrimination (Psychology)#Female#Gene-Environment Interaction#Health Status Disparities#Humans#Hypertension#Male#Middle Aged#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Risk Factors#Young Adult'
b'Severe sepsis or septic shock are the main factors influencing the prognosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN). Our aim was to analyze factors associated with the development of severe sepsis or septic shock in a large sample of patients with acute complicated pyelonephritis (ACPN).This prospective observational study comprised 1507 consecutive patients aged 14 years or older who were admitted to a tertiary care hospital because of ACPN between 1997 and 2015. Covariates associated in univariate analysis with severe sepsis or septic shock were then analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.Of the 1507 patients, 423 (28.1%) fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock at the time of admission. Crude and attributable mortality at 30 days were 17.7% and 11.7% in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock versus 1.7% and 0.6% in patients without severe sepsis or septic shock, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.0001 and P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.0005, respectively.

Some factors associated with severe sepsis are easy to identify in any emergency department. The information provided here could be useful when deciding which patients should be admitted to receive immediate treatment. labels: #Acute Disease#Aged#Female#Hospitalization#Humans#Logistic Models#Male#Middle Aged#Multivariate Analysis#Prevalence#Prospective Studies#Pyelonephritis#Risk Factors#Sepsis#Shock, Septic'
b'Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is the development of heart failure during late pregnancy to months postpartum with potential fatal outcome. However, the disease is not well-studied in Asia.We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of PPCM in Taiwan.Electronic medical records were retrieved from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2011. Patients with PPCM were separated into 3 groups based on the timing of diagnosis. Early: PPCM diagnosed first to ninth month of pregnancy. Traditional: PPCM diagnosed last month of pregnancy till fifth month post-delivery. Late: PPCM diagnosed sixth to twelfth month post-delivery. Primary outcomes defined as cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 1 year.A total of 3,506,081 deliveries during 1997 to 2011 were retrieved and 925 patients with PPCM were identified. Overall incidence of PPCM was 1:3,790 during the 15 years. Early, Traditional, and Late group each had 88, 742, and 95 patients. Cardiac death occurred in 31 patients, all-cause mortality in 72 patients, and MACE in 65 patients. Late group had 2- to 3-fold event rates in cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and MACE compared with Early and Traditional groups. Cumulative incidence showed significant differences for cardiac death (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0011), all-cause mortality (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0031), and MACE (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0014) among 3 groups. Multivariate Cox model showed Late group had significantly worse outcomes after adjusted for clinical variables compared with 2 other groups.Our study is the largest national cohort among Asian countries that showed timing of diagnosis of PPCM had different outcomes.

b'Syphilitic chorioretinitis should be included in differential diagnosis of any form of ocular inflammation. A significantly higher proportion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with ocular syphilis as compared to HIV-negative cases have been reported in published studies. However, the clinical signs and symptoms are more insidious in HIV-negative patients who are easily misdiagnosed. We report a series of cases of ocular syphilis and describe the clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes of syphilitic chorioretinitis in HIV-negative patients in China.This was a retrospective case series study. The clinical records of patients with syphilis chorioretinitis were reviewed. Demographic information and findings of fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were analyzed. All patients received the standard treatment. Ophthalmology examination and laboratory evaluation were repeated every 3 months. All changes were recorded. The treatment was considered successful if the patients had no inflammation in both eyes and rapid plasma reagin titer was negative after therapy.The study examined 41 eyes of 28 HIV-negative patients. The main complaints were blurry vision, floaters, and visual field defect. Twenty-seven eyes presented with panuveitis, and all had posterior involvement, including uveitis, vasculitis, chorioretinitis, and optic neuritis. The most common manifestations were uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Disc hyperfluorescence and persistent dark spots were the most common findings on FFA and ICGA. The ill-defined inner segment/outer segment junction was the most frequent manifestation on SD-OCT. Patients were diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis based on positive serological tests. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was improved in 34 eyes after treatment. Eleven patients were misdiagnosed before serological tests were performed. The delay in treatment led to long-standing cystoid macular edema and optic neuropathy, which were associated with poor BCVA (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.037).The common manifestations of syphilitic chorioretinitis were uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic neuritis. Further diagnosis should be prompted by FFA, ICGA, and SD-OCT when ocular manifestation is suspected. The standard treatment for neurosyphilis was effective. If patients are presumed to be in low-risk groups such as HIV-negative, delays in diagnosis, and therapy may be likely. It is necessary to reiterate the importance of including syphilis uveitis as a differential diagnosis for any form of ocular inflammations, especially posterior uveitis and optic neuropathy. labels: #Adult#Aged#Anti-Bacterial Agents#China#Chorioretinitis#Eye Infections, Bacterial#Female#Fluorescein Angiography#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Optic Neuritis#Retinal Vasculitis#Retrospective Studies#Syphilis#Tomography, Optical Coherence#Treatment Outcome#Uveitis#Visual Acuity'
b'RATIONALE: Staged hepatectomy is an important surgical method for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the insufficient future liver remnant (FLR) is still the major barrier in stage II hepatectomy. We herein reported a case of laparoscopic associating liver tourniquet and portal ligation combined rescue transhepatic arterial embolization (TAE) for staged hepatectomy.PATIENT CONCERNS: Laparoscopic associating liver tourniquet and portal ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALTPS) was performed for cirrhotic HCC in stage I. To stimulate the growth of FLR, a "rescue" TAE was initiated before stage II.DIAGNOSE: HCC with hepatitis B cirrhosis.OUTCOMES: Two weeks later after TAE, the FLR achieved sufficient hypertrophy and stage II surgery was successfully performed. The patient was discharged 7 days after the second stage without serious complication. During the follow-up at postoperative 6 months, the patient underwent radiofrequency ablation, because contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed 1\xe2\x80\x8acm tumor recurrence in the remnant liver.LESSONS: Rescue TAE plays an important role to stimulate the increasing of FLR after ALTPS. labels: #Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Embolization, Therapeutic#Hepatectomy#Humans#Laparoscopy#Ligation#Liver Cirrhosis#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Portal Vein#Postoperative Period#Tourniquets'
b'RATIONALE: In patients with bilateral ureteral obstruction, the serum creatinine levels are often elevated, sometimes causing postrenal acute kidney injury (AKI). In contrast, those with unilateral ureteral obstruction present normal serum creatinine levels, as long as their contralateral kidneys are preserved intact. However, the unilateral obstruction of the ureter could affect the renal function, as it humorally influences the renal hemodynamics.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus came to our outpatient clinic because of right abdominal dullness.DIAGNOSES: Unilateral ureteral obstruction caused by a radio-opaque calculus in the right upper ureter and a secondary renal dysfunction.INTERVENTIONS: As oral hydration and the use of calcium antagonists failed to allow the spontaneous stone passage, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed.OUTCOMES: Immediately after the passage of the stone, the number of red blood cells in the urine was dramatically decreased and the serum creatinine level almost returned to the normal range with the significant increase in glomerular filtration rate.LESSONS: Unilateral ureteral obstruction by the calculus, which caused reflex vascular constriction and ureteral spasm in the contralateral kidney, was thought to be responsible for the deteriorating renal function. labels: #Acute Kidney Injury#Aged#Humans#Kidney#Male#Ureteral Obstruction#Urolithiasis'
b'Angiogenesis plays an important role during bone regeneration. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been proven to accelerate the process of bone fracture healing. However, the mechanism of the effect of LIPUS on bone regeneration is still unclear. In the present study, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and human osteosarcoma cell (MG-63) to investigate the effect of LIPUS stimulation in an endothelial cell-osteoblast coculture system. At the same time, we used transwell and in vitro angiogenesis assay to observe how LIPUS affects endothelial cells. The results demonstrated that LIPUS could significantly increase the migratory ability and promote tube formation in angiogenesis of HUVECs. Furthermore, LIPUS could significantly elevate the expression of osteogenesis-related genes on osteoblasts such as Runt-related transcription factor 2, alkaline phosphatase, Osteorix, and Cyclin-D1, indicating the pro-osteogenesis effect of LIPUS in our coculture system. In conclusion, endothelial cell is involved in LIPUS-accelerated bone regeneration, the positive effect of LIPUS may be transferred via endothelial cells surrounding fracture healing site. labels: #Cell Line, Tumor#Coculture Techniques#Culture Media, Conditioned#Endothelial Cells#Fracture Healing#Humans#Osteoblasts#Osteogenesis#Osteosarcoma#Ultrasonic Waves'
b'Interpersonal and communication skills are 2 essential qualities of every physician. These are separate and distinct parts of the professional character of every physician. In pediatrics these abilities present even a higher impact.We performed a survey-type prospective study based on questionnaires on 100 subjects, equally divided into 4 groups: 25 children, 25 pediatricians, 25 care-givers (parents, tutors, and relatives), and 25 health care staff, in a Tertiary Pediatric Clinic from Romania, between January 2017 and April 2017.We included 100 participants in our study, equally divided into 4 groups: pediatric patients, pediatricians, care-givers, and health care staff. The 1st group comprised 25 children diagnosed with different chronic conditions, presenting the age between 5 and 14 years. The male gender predominated among the children (57%). The lowest general average score for "Communication" section was encountered among pediatricians group, 3.8, while the other 3 groups presented the same average score for this section, that is, 4.6. The children and the health care staff offered the same average score for "Transparency," that is, 4.6, while the pediatricians offered a score of 4.5, and the care-givers of 4.7. The lowest average score for the item "Hospital environment" was given by the doctors, that is, 3.3, followed by care-givers with a score of 3.6, health care staff 3.7, and children with an average score of 3.8. All the 4 groups included in the study offered a general average of 4.9 out of 5 for the "Intercultural issues" section. The lowest average score for "Time management" section was offered by both children and pediatricians, that is, 4.1, while care-givers and health care staff had a slightly better perception regarding this item, offering 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.The opinion among the 4 groups included in the study was generally similar regarding the 5 items assessed by our questionnaires. Therefore, the main aspects that need to be improved in the health care system in downward order are the following: hospital environment, time management, communication, transparency, and intercultural issues. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Caregivers#Child#Child, Preschool#Communication#Female#Health Personnel#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Pediatricians#Physician-Patient Relations#Prospective Studies#Romania#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b'BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend that norepinephrine (NA) should be used to reach the target mean arterial pressure (MAP) during cardiogenic shock (CS), rather than epinephrine and dopamine (DA). However, there has actually been few studies on comparing norepinephrine with dopamine and their results conflicts. These studies raise a heat discussion. This study aimed to validate the effectiveness of norepinephrine for treating CS in comparison with dopamine.METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess pooled estimates of risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for 28-day mortality, incidence of arrhythmic events, gastrointestinal reaction, and some indexes after treatment.RESULTS: Compared with dopamine, patients receiving norepinephrine had a lower 28-day mortality (RR 1.611 [95% CI 1.219-2.129]; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001; P heterogeneity\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.01), a lower risk of arrhythmic events (RR 3.426 [95% CI 2.120-5.510]; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001; P heterogeneity\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.875) and a lower risk of gastrointestinal reaction (RR 5.474 [95% CI 2.917-10.273]; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001; P heterogeneity\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0). In subgroup analyses on 28-day mortality by causes of CS, there were more benefits from norepinephrine than dopamine in 2 subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed that norepinephrine was associated with a lower 28-day mortality, a lower risk of arrhythmic events, and gastrointestinal reaction. No matter whether CS is caused by coronary heart disease or not, norepinephrine is superior to dopamine for correcting CS on the 28-day mortality. labels: #Cardiotonic Agents#Dopamine#Humans#Norepinephrine#Odds Ratio#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Shock, Cardiogenic#Treatment Outcome'
b'Water constraints can mediate evolutionary conflict either among individuals (e.g., parent-offspring conflict, sexual conflict) or within an individual (e.g., cost of reproduction). During pregnancy, water is of particular importance because the female provides all water needed for embryonic development and experiences important maternal shifts in behavior and physiology that, together, can compromise female water balance if water availability is limited. We examined the effect of pregnancy on evaporative water loss and microhabitat selection in a viviparous snake, the aspic viper. We found that both physiological (increased metabolism and body temperature) and morphological (body distension) changes contribute to an increased evaporative water loss in pregnant females. We also found that pregnant females in the wild select warmer and moister basking locations than nonreproductive females, likely to mitigate the conflict between thermal needs and water loss. Water resources likely induce significant reproductive constraints across diverse taxa and thus warrant further consideration in ecological research. From an evolutionary perspective, water constraints during reproduction may contribute to shaping reproductive effort. labels: #Animals#Female#Viperidae#Viviparity, Nonmammalian#Water Loss, Insensible'
b"Purpose: Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is the most common cause of childhood congenital blindness in developed nations, yet the fundamental pathobiology of ONH remains unknown. The objective of this study was to employ a 'face validated' murine model to determine the timing of onset and the pathologic characteristics of ONH.Methods: Based on the robust linkage between X-linked CASK haploinsufficiency and clinically diagnosed ONH, we hypothesized that heterozygous deletion of CASK (CASK(+/-)) in rodents will produce an optic nerve pathology closely recapitulating ONH. We quantitatively analyzed the entire subcortical visual system in female CASK(+/-) mice using immunohistochemistry, anterograde axonal tracing, toluidine blue staining, transmission electron microscopy, and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy.Results: CASK haploinsuffiency in mice phenocopies human ONH with complete penetrance, thus satisfying the 'face validity'. We demonstrate that the optic nerve in CASK(+/-) mice is not only thin, but is comprised of atrophic retinal axons and displays reactive astrogliosis. Myelination of the optic nerve axons remains unchanged. Moreover, we demonstrate a significant decrease in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) numbers and perturbation in retinothalamic connectivity. Finally, we used this mouse model to define the onset and progression of ONH pathology, demonstrating for the first time that optic nerve defects arise at neonatally in CASK(+/-)mice.Conclusions: Optic nerve hypoplasia is a complex neuropathology of the subcortical visual system involving RGC loss, axonopathy, and synaptopathy and originates at a developmental stage in mice that corresponds to the late third trimester development in humans. labels: #Animals#Axons#Disease Models, Animal#Disease Progression#Guanylate Kinases#Immunohistochemistry#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mutation#Optic Nerve#Optic Nerve Diseases#Retinal Ganglion Cells"
b'Voltage-sensitive dye imaging experiments in primary visual cortex (V1) have shown that local, oriented visual stimuli elicit stable orientation-selective activation within the stimulus retinotopic footprint. The cortical activation dynamically extends far beyond the retinotopic footprint, but the peripheral spread stays non-selective-a surprising finding given a number of anatomo-functional studies showing the orientation specificity of long-range connections. Here we use a computational model to investigate this apparent discrepancy by studying the expected population response using known published anatomical constraints. The dynamics of input-driven localized states were simulated in a planar neural field model with multiple sub-populations encoding orientation. The realistic connectivity profile has parameters controlling the clustering of long-range connections and their orientation bias. We found substantial overlap between the anatomically relevant parameter range and a steep decay in orientation selective activation that is consistent with the imaging experiments. In this way our study reconciles the reported orientation bias of long-range connections with the functional expression of orientation selective neural activity. Our results demonstrate this sharp decay is contingent on three factors, that long-range connections are sufficiently diffuse, that the orientation bias of these connections is in an intermediate range (consistent with anatomy) and that excitation is sufficiently balanced by inhibition. Conversely, our modelling results predict that, for reduced inhibition strength, spurious orientation selective activation could be generated through long-range lateral connections. Furthermore, if the orientation bias of lateral connections is very strong, or if inhibition is particularly weak, the network operates close to an instability leading to unbounded cortical activation. labels: #Animals#Computer Simulation#Humans#Models, Neurological#Nerve Net#Visual Cortex#Visual Fields#Visual Pathways#Visual Perception'
b'The purpose of this study was to determine among patients with candidemia the real rate of ophthalmoscopy and the impact of performing ocular assessment on the outcome of the disease. We performed a post hoc analysis of a prospective, multicenter, population-based candidemia surveillance program implemented in Spain during 2010-2011 (CANDIPOP). Ophthalmoscopy was performed in only 168 of the 365 patients with candidemia (46%). Ocular lesions related to candidemia were found in only 13/168 patients (7.7%), of whom 1 reported ocular symptoms (incidence of symptomatic disease in the whole population, 0.27% [1/365]). Ophthalmological findings led to a change in antifungal therapy in only 5.9% of cases (10/168), and performance of the test was not related to a better outcome. Ocular candidiasis was not associated with a worse outcome and progressed favorably in all but 1 evaluable patient, who did not experience vision loss. The low frequency of ophthalmoscopy and ocular involvement and the asymptomatic nature of ocular candidiasis, with a favorable outcome in almost all cases, lead us to reconsider the need for systematic ophthalmoscopy in all candidemic patients. labels: #Aged#Antifungal Agents#Candidemia#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Ophthalmoscopy#Prospective Studies#Spain'
b"Treatment with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has proven effective against HIV-1 infections in humanized mice, non-human primates, and humans. Due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, resistance testing of the patient's viral strains to the bNAbs is still inevitable. So far, bNAb resistance can only be tested in expensive and time-consuming neutralization experiments. Here, we introduce well-performing computational models that predict the neutralization response of HIV-1 to bNAbs given only the envelope sequence of the virus. Using non-linear support vector machines based on a string kernel, the models learnt even the important binding sites of bNAbs with more complex epitopes, i.e., the CD4 binding site targeting bNAbs, proving thereby the biological relevance of the models. To increase the interpretability of the models, we additionally provide a new kind of motif logo for each query sequence, visualizing those residues of the test sequence that influenced the prediction outcome the most. Moreover, we predicted the neutralization sensitivity of around 34,000 HIV-1 samples from different time points to a broad range of bNAbs, enabling the first analysis of HIV resistance to bNAbs on a global scale. The analysis showed for many of the bNAbs a trend towards antibody resistance over time, which had previously only been discovered for a small non-representative subset of the global HIV-1 population. labels: #Antibodies, Neutralizing#Binding Sites#CD4 Antigens#Drug Resistance, Viral#Epitope Mapping#HIV Antibodies#HIV-1#Humans#Protein Binding#Protein Interaction Mapping#Sequence Analysis, Protein#Time Factors"
b"Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary, plays a vital role in maintaining vasomotor tone during acute blood loss. We hypothesized that decompensated hemorrhagic shock is associated with decreased AVP stores and supplementation during resuscitation would improve both blood pressure and renal function. Using a decompensated hemorrhagic shock model, male Long-Evans rats were bled to mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 40mmHg and maintained until the MAP could not be sustained without fluid. Once 40% of the shed volume was returned in lactated Ringer's (Severe Shock), animals were resuscitated over 60 minutes with 4x the shed volume in lactated Ringer's (LR) or the same fluids with AVP (0.5 units/kg+ 0.03 units/kg/min). Animals (n = 6-9/group) were sacrificed before hemorrhage (Sham), at Severe Shock, following resuscitation (60R, 60R with AVP) or 18 hours post-resuscitation (18hr, 18hr with AVP). Blood samples were taken to measure AVP levels and renal function. Pituitaries were harvested and assayed for AVP. Kidney samples were taken to assess mitochondrial function, histology, and oxidative damage. Baseline pituitary AVP stores (30,364 \xc2\xb1 5311 pg/mg) decreased with severe shock and were significantly depressed post-resuscitation (13,910 \xc2\xb1 3016 pg/ml. p<0.05) and at 18hr (15,592 \xc2\xb11169 pg/ml, p<0.05). Resuscitation with LR+AVP led to higher serum AVP levels at 60R (31\xc2\xb18 vs 79\xc2\xb112; p<0.01) with an improved MAP both at 60R (125\xc2\xb13 vs 77\xc2\xb17mmHg; p<0.01) and 18hr (82\xc2\xb16 vs 69\xc2\xb15mmHg;p<0.05). AVP supplementation preserved complex I respiratory capacity at 60R and both complex I and II function at 18hr (p<0.05). AVP was also associated with decreased reactive oxygen species at 60R (856\xc2\xb167 vs 622\xc2\xb148F RFU) and significantly decreased oxidative damage as measured by mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (0.9\xc2\xb10.1 vs 1.7\xc2\xb10.1 fold change, p<0.01) and nitrosylation (0.9\xc2\xb10.1 vs 1.4\xc2\xb10.2 fold change, p<0.05). With AVP, renal damage was mitigated at 60R and histologic architecture was conserved at 18 hours. In conclusion, pituitary and serum AVP levels decrease during severe hemorrhage and may contribute to the development of decompensated hemorrhagic shock. Supplementing exogenous AVP during resuscitation improves blood pressure, preserves renal mitochondrial function, and mitigates acute kidney injury. labels: #Animals#Arginine Vasopressin#Kidney#Male#Mitochondria#Rats#Rats, Long-Evans#Shock, Hemorrhagic"
b'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Long-term follow-up studies validating the clinical benefit of sustained virological response (SVR) in people with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection are lacking. Our aim was to identify rates and predictors of liver fibrosis progression in a large, well characterized cohort of CHC patients in whom paired liver fibrosis assessments were performed more than 10 years apart.METHODS: CHC patients who had undergone a baseline liver biopsy pre-2004 and a follow up liver fibrosis assessment more than 10 years later (biopsy or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography [FibroScan]) were identified. Subjects who had undergone a baseline liver biopsy but had no follow up fibrosis assessment were recalled for LSM. Fibrosis was categorised as mild-moderate (METAVIR F0-2 /LSM result of \xe2\x89\xa4 9.5 kPa) or advanced (METAVIR F3-4/ LSM>9.5 kPa). The primary objective was to assess the association between SVR and the rate of liver fibrosis progression over at least 10 years, defined as an increase from mild-moderate fibrosis at baseline liver biopsy (METAVIR F0-2) to advanced fibrosis at follow-up liver fibrosis assessment.RESULTS: 131 subjects were included in this analysis: 69% male, 82% Caucasian, 60% G1 HCV, 25% G3 HCV. The median age at F/U fibrosis staging was 57 (IQR 54-62) years with median estimated duration of infection 33-years (IQR 29-38). At F/U, liver fibrosis assessment was performed by LSM in 86% and liver biopsy in 14%. The median period between fibrosis assessments was 14-years (IQR 12-17). 109 (83%) participants had received interferon-based antiviral therapy. 40% attained SVR. At F/U, there was a significant increase in the proportion of subjects with advanced liver fibrosis: 27% at baseline vs. 46% at F/U (p = 0.002). The prevalence of advanced fibrosis did not change among subjects who attained SVR, 30% at B/L vs 25% at F/U (p = 0.343). However, advanced fibrosis became more common at F/U among subjects with persistent viremia: 10% at B/L vs 31% at F/U (p = 0.0001). SVR was independently associated with protection from liver fibrosis progression after adjustment for other variables including baseline ALT (p = 0.011), duration of HCV infection and mode of acquisition.CONCLUSION: HCV eradication is associated with lower rates of liver fibrosis progression. The data support early treatment to prevent long-term liver complications of HCV infection. labels: #Disease Progression#Female#Hepatitis C, Chronic#Humans#Liver Cirrhosis#Male#Middle Aged#Viral Load#Viremia'
b"Publication bias is prevalent within the scientific literature. Whilst there are multiple ideas on how to reduce publication bias, only a minority of journals have made substantive changes to address the problem. We aimed to explore the perceived feasibility of strategies to reduce publication bias by gauging opinions of journal editors (n = 73) and other academics/researchers (n = 160) regarding nine methods of publishing and peer-reviewing research: mandatory publication, negative results journals/articles, open reviewing, peer-review training and accreditation, post-publication review, pre-study publication of methodology, published rejection lists, research registration, and two-stage review. Participants completed a questionnaire asking both quantitative (multiple choice or Likert scales) and qualitative (open-ended) questions regarding the barriers to implementing each suggestion, and their strengths and limitations. Participants were asked to rate the nine suggestions, then choose the method they felt was most effective. Mandatory publication was most popularly selected as the 'most effective' method of reducing publication bias for editors (25%), and was the third most popular choice for academics/researchers (14%). The most common selection for academics/researchers was two-stage review (26%), but fewer editors prioritised this (11%). Negative results journals/articles were the second and third most common choices for academics/researchers (21%) and editors (16%), respectively. Editors more commonly chose research registration as 'most effective' (21%), which was favoured by only 6% of academics/researchers. Whilst mandatory publication was generally favoured by respondents, it is infeasible to trial at a journal level. Where suggestions have already been implemented (e.g. negative results journals/articles, trial registration), efforts should be made to objectively assess their efficacy. Two-stage review should be further trialled as its popularity amongst academics/researchers suggests it may be well received, though editors may be less receptive. Several underlying barriers to change also emerged, including scientific culture, impact factors, and researcher training; these should be further explored to reduce publication bias. labels: #Feasibility Studies#Publication Bias"
b"BACKGROUND: The relatively high incidence of cervical cancer in women at older ages is a continuing concern in countries with long-established cervical screening. Controversy remains on when and how to cease screening. Existing population-based studies on the effectiveness of cervical screening at older ages have not considered women's screening history. We performed a nationwide cohort study to investigate the incidence of cervical cancer after age 60 years and its association with cervical screening at age 61-65, stratified by screening history at age 51-60.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Total Population Register, we identified 569,132 women born between 1 January 1919 and 31 December 1945, resident in Sweden since age 51. Women's cytological screening records, cervical cancer occurrence, and FIGO stage (for those diagnosed with cancer) were retrieved from national registers and medical charts. We calculated the cumulative incidence of cervical cancer from age 61 to age 80 using a survival function considering competing risk, and estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of cervical cancer in relation to screening status at age 61-65 from Cox models, adjusted for birth cohort and level of education, conditioning on women's screening history in their 50s. In women unscreened in their 50s, the cumulative incidence up to age 80 was 5.0 per 1,000 women, and screening at age 61-65 was associated with a lower risk for cervical cancer (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.72), corresponding to a decrease of 3.3 cancer cases per 1,000 women. A higher cumulative incidence and similarly statistically significant risk decrease was seen for women with abnormal smears in their 50s. In women adequately or inadequately screened with only normal results between age 51 and age 60, the cumulative incidence of cervical cancer from age 61 to 80 was 1.6 and 2.5 per 1,000 women, respectively, and further screening at age 61-65 was not associated with statistically significant decreases of cervical cancer risk up to age 80, but with fewer cancer cases of advanced stages at age 61-65. Adjustment for potential lifestyle confounders was limited.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, cervical screening with cytology at age 61-65 was associated with a statistically significant reduction of subsequent cervical cancer risk for women who were unscreened, or screened with abnormalities, in their 50s. In women screened with normal results in their 50s, the risk for future cancer was not sizeable, and the risk reduction associated with continued screening appeared limited. These findings should inform the current debate regarding age and criteria to discontinue cervical screening. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Age Factors#Aged#Atypical Squamous Cells of the Cervix#Carcinoma, Squamous Cell#Cohort Studies#Early Detection of Cancer#Female#Humans#Incidence#Middle Aged#Papanicolaou Test#Proportional Hazards Models#Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions of the Cervix#Sweden#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms#Vaginal Smears"
b"Monitoring is an essential component of wildlife management and conservation. However, the usefulness of monitoring data is often undermined by the lack of 1) coordination across organizations and regions, 2) meaningful management and conservation objectives, and 3) rigorous sampling designs. Although many improvements to avian monitoring have been discussed, the recommendations have been slow to emerge in large-scale programs. We introduce the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program designed to overcome the above limitations. Our objectives are to outline the development of a statistically defensible sampling design to increase the value of large-scale monitoring data and provide example applications to demonstrate the ability of the design to meet multiple conservation and management objectives. We outline the sampling process for the IMBCR program with a focus on the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17). We provide two examples for the Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri) in BCR 17 demonstrating the ability of the design to 1) determine hierarchical population responses to landscape change and 2) estimate hierarchical habitat relationships to predict the response of the Brewer's sparrow to conservation efforts at multiple spatial scales. The collaboration across organizations and regions provided economy of scale by leveraging a common data platform over large spatial scales to promote the efficient use of monitoring resources. We designed the IMBCR program to address the information needs and core conservation and management objectives of the participating partner organizations. Although it has been argued that probabilistic sampling designs are not practical for large-scale monitoring, the IMBCR program provides a precedent for implementing a statistically defensible sampling design from local to bioregional scales. We demonstrate that integrating conservation and management objectives with rigorous statistical design and analyses ensures reliable knowledge about bird populations that is relevant and integral to bird conservation at multiple scales. labels: #Animals#Birds#Conservation of Natural Resources#Environmental Monitoring"
b"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine the sources of inequity in health examination service utilization by women from underdeveloped areas in western China.METHODS: Based on data from the 5th National Health Service Survey in Shaanxi province, women's utilization of health examination services was examined according to gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates. The equity of health examination service utilization by 15- to 64-year-old women and the factors contributing to inequity were determined using the health concentration index, decomposition of the concentration index, and the horizontal inequity index.RESULTS: The examination rates for gynecological, cervical smear, and breast exams for 15- to 64-year-old women in Shaanxi province were 40.61%, 27.08%, and 24.59%, respectively. The horizontal inequity indices of gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 0.0480, 0.0423, and 0.0764, respectively, and each examination rate was higher for wealthy individuals. The contribution rates of economic status to the inequalities in gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 65.80%, 74.31%, and 56.49%, respectively. The contribution rates of educational status to the inequalities in gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 21.01%, 14.83% and 30.00%, respectively. The contribution rates of age to the inequalities in gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 25.77%, 26.55%, and 18.40%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Women's health examination rates differed between populations with different socio-demographic characteristics. There is pro-wealth inequality in each examination rate. This study found that financial status, age, and education level were the main reasons for the unequal utilization of health examination services. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#China#Female#Healthcare Disparities#Humans#Medically Underserved Area#Middle Aged#Papanicolaou Test#Physical Examination#Women's Health Services#Young Adult"
b'BACKGROUND: A close relationship between Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has been described, but the exact nature of this link remains unclear. Current epidemiological data refer exclusively to the MetS prevalence among patients with COPD and data about the prevalence of COPD in MetS patients are still unavailable.AIM OF THE STUDY: To analyse and compare risk factors, clinical and metabolic characteristics, as well as the main respiratory function parameters, among patients affected by MetS, COPD or both diseases.PATIENTS: We recruited 59 outpatients with MetS and 76 outpatients with COPD. After medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling for routine analysis, spirometric evaluation, they were subdivided into MetS (n = 46), MetS+COPD (n = 60), COPD (n = 29).RESULTS: A MetS diagnosis was assigned to 62% of COPD patients recruited in the COPD Outpatients Clinic of the Pneumology Department, while the COPD prevalence in MetS patients enrolled in the Internal Medicine Metabolic Disorders Outpatients Clinic was 22%. More than 60% of subjects enrolled in each Department were unaware that they suffered from an additional disease. MetS+COPD patients exhibited significantly higher C-peptide levels. We also found a positive relation between C-peptide and pack-years in all subjects and a negative correlation between C-peptide and vitamin D only in current smokers. Finally, a negative association emerged between smoking and vitamin D.CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated, for the first time, the COPD prevalence in MetS and suggest a potential role of smoking in inducing insulin resistance. Moreover, a direct effect of smoking on vitamin D levels is proposed as a novel mechanism, which may account for both insulin resistance and COPD development. labels: #Aged#Female#Humans#Insulin Resistance#Male#Metabolic Syndrome#Middle Aged#Prevalence#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive#Smoking#Vitamin D'
b'ApbE is a member of a novel family of flavin transferases that incorporates flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to subunits of diverse respiratory complexes, which fulfill important homeostatic functions. In this work a detailed characterization of Vibrio cholerae ApbE physiologic activity, substrate specificity and pH dependency was carried out. The data obtained show novel characteristics of the regulation and function of this family. For instance, our experiments indicate that divalent cations are essential for ApbE function, and that the selectivity depends largely on size and the coordination sphere of the cation. Our data also show that ApbE regulation by pH, ADP and potassium is an important mechanism that enhances the adaptation, survival and colonization of V. cholerae in the small intestine. Moreover, studies of the pH-dependency of the activity show that the reaction is favored under alkaline conditions, with a pKa of 8.4. These studies, together with sequence and structure analysis allowed us to identify His257, which is absolutely conserved in the family, as a candidate for the residue whose deprotonation controls the activity. Remarkably, the mutant H257G abolished the flavin transfer activity, strongly indicating that this residue plays an important role in the catalytic mechanism of ApbE. labels: #Bacterial Proteins#Cations, Divalent#Cations, Monovalent#Hydrogen-Ion Concentration#Kinetics#Substrate Specificity#Vibrio cholerae'
b'Suboptimal gestational weight gain (GWG), which is linked to increased risk of adverse outcomes for a pregnant woman and her infant, is prevalent. In the study of a large cohort of Canadian pregnant women, our goals are to estimate the individual weight growth trajectory using sparsely collected bodyweight data, and to identify the factors affecting the weight change during pregnancy, such as prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), dietary intakes and physical activity. The first goal was achieved through functional principal component analysis (FPCA) by conditional expectation. For the second goal, we used linear regression with the total weight gain as the response variable. The trajectory modeling through FPCA had a significantly smaller root mean square error (RMSE) and improved adaptability than the classic nonlinear mixed-effect models, demonstrating a novel tool that can be used to facilitate real time monitoring and interventions of GWG. Our regression analysis showed that prepregnancy BMI had a high predictive value for the weight changes during pregnancy, which agrees with the published weight gain guideline. labels: #Body Mass Index#Female#Humans#Models, Theoretical#Pregnancy#Principal Component Analysis#Weight Gain'
b'Condomless anal sex between male partners is the primary risk factor for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). Correlates of condomless anal sex have been well-studied in developed countries, but they have received less attention in lower-to-middle income countries (LMIC), where MSM are often subject to stigma, discrimination, intolerance, and even the criminalization of same sex behavior. In Mexico, a LMIC where traditional views on homosexuality are common, HIV prevalence among MSM is high (16.9%), yet little research has been conducted on the correlates of condomless anal sex in this high-risk population. The present study examined correlates of condomless anal sex among 201 MSM recruited in Tijuana, Mexico, with a focus on the role of public sex venues in relation to sexual risk behavior. Eligibility requirements were: biologically male, 18 years of age or older, resident of Tijuana, and self-reported anal or oral sex with a male partner in the past year. Participants completed an interviewer-administered, demographic and psychosocial survey, and were tested for HIV and syphilis. A hierarchical multiple linear regression model was tested to identify correlates of condomless anal sex. Thirty-eight percent of participants (N = 76) reported condomless anal sex with a male partner in the past 2 months. Higher levels of condomless anal sex were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, greater sexual compulsivity, and more frequent seeking out of sex partners in a public venue in the past 2 months. In view of these findings, we recommend the development of multi-level, "combination" interventions, which in the Mexican context should include enhanced condom promotion and distribution, improved availability and access to mental health treatment and counseling services, and expanded HIV/STI testing in public venues. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Condoms#HIV Infections#Homosexuality, Male#Humans#Male#Sexual Behavior#Sexual Partners#Young Adult'
b'Renalase decreases circulating catecholamines concentration and is important in maintaining primary cellular metabolism. Renalase acts through the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4b in the heart, which affects pressure overload but not exercise induced heart hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to test the association between a functional polymorphism Glu37Asp (rs2296545) of the renalase gene and left ventricular hypertrophy in a large cohort of patients with aortic stenosis. The study group consisted of 657 patients with aortic stenosis referred for aortic valve replacement. Preoperative echocardiographic assessment was performed to obtain cardiac phenotypes. Generalized-linear models were implemented to analyze data using crude or full model adjusted for selected clinical factors. In females, the Asp37 variant of the Glu37Asp polymorphism was associated with higher left ventricular mass (p = 0.0021 and p = 0.055 crude and full model respectively), intraventricular septal thickness (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0143) and posterior wall thickness (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0219) all indexed to body surface area, as well as relative wall thickness (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0097). No significant associations were found among the male patients. In conclusion, we have found the association of the renalase Glu37Asp polymorphism with left ventricle hypertrophy in large group of females with aortic stenosis. The Glu37Asp polymorphism causes not only amino-acid substitution in FAD binding domain but may also change binding affinity of the hypoxia- and hypertrophy-related transcription factors and influence renalase gene expression. Our data suggest that renalase might play a role in hypertrophic response to pressure overload, but the exact mechanism requires further investigation. labels: #Aged#Aortic Valve Stenosis#Binding Sites#Cardiomegaly#Cohort Studies#Echocardiography#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Monoamine Oxidase#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Transcription Factors'
b"TW-37 is a novel, potent and non-peptide Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitor. Its activity in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells is studied. In both HCT-116 cells and primary human colon cancer cells, treatment with TW-37 at only nM concentration efficiently inhibited cell survival and proliferation. TW-37 also induced caspase-3/9 and apoptosis activation in CRC cells. Feedback autophagy activation was observed in TW-37-treated CRC cells. Reversely pharmacological autophagy inhibition or Beclin-1 knockdown by targeted-shRNA potentiated TW-37-induced apoptosis and killing of CRC cells. In vivo, intravenous injection of TW-37 inhibited HCT-116 tumor growth in mice. TW-37's anti-tumor activity was further potentiated against Beclin-1-silenced HCT-116 tumors. Together, targeting Bcl-2 family protein by TW-37 efficiently inhibits CRC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of feedback autophagy activation could further sensitize TW-37. labels: #Animals#Apoptosis#Benzamides#Cell Proliferation#Colorectal Neoplasms#HCT116 Cells#Humans#Mice#Mice, SCID#Sulfones#Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"
b'Theoretical models of populations and swarms typically start with the assumption that the motion of agents is governed by the local stimuli. However, an intelligent agent, with some understanding of the laws that govern its habitat, can anticipate the future, and make predictions to gather resources more efficiently. Here we study a specific model of this kind, where agents aim to maximize their consumption of a diffusing resource, by attempting to predict the future of a resource field and the actions of other agents. Once the agents make a prediction, they are attracted to move towards regions that have, and will have, denser resources. We find that the further the agents attempt to see into the future, the more their attempts at prediction fail, and the less resources they consume. We also study the case where predictive agents compete against non-predictive agents and find the predictors perform better than the non-predictors only when their relative numbers are very small. We conclude that predictivity pays off either when the predictors do not see too far into the future or the number of predictors is small. labels: #Diffusion#Models, Theoretical#Motion'
b'Neisseria meningitidis is the causative agent of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). A recombinant vaccine called Bexsero\xc2\xae incorporates four subcapsular antigens (fHbp, NHBA, NadA and PorA) which are used to assign a Bexsero\xc2\xae antigen sequence type (BAST) to each meningococcal strain. The vaccine elicits an immune response against combinations of variants of these antigens which have been grouped into specific BAST profiles that have been shown to have different distributions within geographical locations thus potentially affecting the efficacy of the vaccine. In this study, invasive meningococcal disease isolates from the western seaboard of Australia (Western Australia; WA) were compared to those from the south-eastern seaboard (Victoria; VIC) from 2008 to 2012. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 131 meningococci from VIC and 70 meningococci from WA were analysed for MLST, FetA and BAST profiling. Serogroup B predominated in both jurisdictions and a total of 10 MLST clonal complexes (cc) were shared by both states. Isolates belonging to cc22, cc103 and cc1157 were unique to VIC whilst isolates from cc60 and cc212 were unique to WA. Clonal complex 41/44 represented one-third of the meningococcal population in each state but the predominant ST was locally different: ST-6058 in VIC and ST-146 in WA. Of the 108 BAST profiles identified in this collection, only 9 BASTs were simultaneously observed in both states. A significantly larger proportion of isolates in VIC harboured alleles for the NHBA-2 peptide and fHbp-1, antigenic variants predicted to be covered by the Bexsero\xc2\xae vaccine. The estimate for vaccine coverage in WA (47.1% [95% CI: 41.1-53.1%]) was significantly lower than that in VIC (66.4% [95% CI: 62.3-70.5%]). In conclusion, the antigenic structure of meningococci causing invasive disease in two geographically distinct states of Australia differed significantly during the study period which may affect vaccine effectiveness and highlights the need for representative surveillance when predicting potential impact of meningococcal B vaccines. labels: #Antigens, Bacterial#Genes, Bacterial#Humans#Neisseria meningitidis#Victoria#Western Australia'
b"The progression of Alzheimer's disease is causatively linked to the accumulation of amyloid-\xce\xb2 aggregates in the brain, however, it is not clear how the amyloid aggregates initiate the death of neuronal cells. The in vitro toxic effects of amyloid peptides are most commonly examined using the human neuroblastoma derived SH-SY5Y cell line and here we show that differentiated neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells are more sensitive to amyloid peptides than non-differentiated cells, because the latter lack long neurites. Exogenous soluble amyloid-\xce\xb2 1-42 covered cell bodies and whole neurites in differentiated cells with dense fibrils, causing neurite beading and fragmentation, whereas preformed amyloid-\xce\xb2 1-42 fibrils had no toxic effects. Importantly, spontaneously fibrillizing amyloid-\xce\xb2 1-42 peptide exhibited substantially higher cellular toxicity than amyloid-\xce\xb2 1-40, which did not form fibrils under the experimental conditions. These results support the hypothesis that peptide toxicity is related to the active fibrillization process in the incubation mixture. labels: #Amyloid beta-Peptides#Apoptosis#Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor#Cell Differentiation#Cell Line, Tumor#Humans#Neurites#Peptide Fragments"
b"Tuberculosis is a fatal human infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) that is prevalent worldwide. Mycobacteria differ from other bacteria in that they have a cell wall composed of specific surface glycans that are the major determinant of these organisms' pathogenicity. The interaction of M. tuberculosis with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), in particular C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), on the surface of macrophages plays a central role in initiating innate and adaptive immunity, but the picture as a whole remains a puzzle. Defining novel mechanisms by which host receptors interact with pathogens in order to modulate a specific immune response is an area of intense research. In this study, based on an in vitro lectin binding assay, CLEC9A (DNGR-1) is identified as a novel CLR that binds with mycobacteria. Our results with CLEC9A-knocked down cells and a CLEC9A-Fc fusion protein as blocking agents show that CLEC9A is involved in the activation of SYK and MAPK signaling in response to heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Ra treatment, and it then promotes the production of CXCL8 and IL-1\xce\xb2 in macrophages. The CXCL8 and IL-1\xce\xb2 secreted by the activated macrophages are critical to neutrophil recruitment and activation. In a in vivo mouse model, when the interaction between CLEC9A and H37Ra is interfered with by treatment with CLEC9A-Fc fusion protein, this reduces lung inflammation and cell infiltration. These findings demonstrate that CLEC9A is a specialized receptor that modulates the innate immune response when there is a mycobacterial infection. labels: #Animals#Cell Line#Gene Knockdown Techniques#Hot Temperature#Humans#Lectins, C-Type#Macrophages#Male#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Neutrophils#Protein Kinases#Receptors, Mitogen#Signal Transduction"
b'Neuromodulation of peripheral nerves with bioelectronic devices is a promising approach for treating a wide range of disorders. Wireless powering could enable long-term operation of these devices, but achieving high performance for miniaturized and deeply placed devices remains a technological challenge. We report the miniaturized integration of a wireless powering system in soft neuromodulation device (15 mm length, 2.7 mm diameter) and demonstrate high performance (about 10%) during in vivo wireless stimulation of the vagus nerve in a porcine animal model. The increased performance is enabled by the generation of a focused and circularly polarized field that enhances efficiency and provides immunity to polarization misalignment. These performance characteristics establish the clinical potential of wireless powering for emerging therapies based on neuromodulation. labels: #Animals#Electrodes#Equipment Design#Female#Miniaturization#Peripheral Nerves#Swine#Wireless Technology'
b'Alopecia X is a hair cycle arrest disorder in Pomeranians. Histologically, kenogen and telogen hair follicles predominate, whereas anagen follicles are sparse. The induction of anagen relies on the activation of hair follicle stem cells and their subsequent proliferation and differentiation. Stem cell function depends on finely tuned interactions of signaling molecules and transcription factors, which are not well defined in dogs. We performed transcriptome profiling on skin biopsies to analyze altered molecular pathways in alopecia X. Biopsies from five affected and four non-affected Pomeranians were investigated. Differential gene expression revealed a downregulation of key regulator genes of the Wnt (CTNNB1, LEF1, TCF3, WNT10B) and Shh (SHH, GLI1, SMO, PTCH2) pathways. In mice it has been shown that Wnt and Shh signaling results in stem cell activation and differentiation Thus our findings are in line with the lack of anagen hair follicles in dogs with Alopecia X. We also observed a significant downregulation of the stem cell markers SOX9, LHX2, LGR5, TCF7L1 and GLI1 whereas NFATc1, a quiescence marker, was upregulated in alopecia X. Moreover, genes coding for enzymes directly involved in the sex hormone metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, HSD17B14) were differentially regulated in alopecia X. These findings are in agreement with the so far proposed but not yet proven deregulation of the sex hormone metabolism in this disease. labels: #Alopecia#Animals#Biomarkers#Dogs#Female#Hair#Male#Receptors, Calcitriol#Stem Cells'
