b'Cancer stem cells (CSCs) account for tumor self-renewal and heterogeneity. Oxidative-nitrosative stress (ONS) is an independent etiologic factor throughout tumorigenesis. Emerging evidences indicated that the interaction of ONS with CSCs contributes to tumor progression and resistance to chemoradiotherapy. Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a member of human hexacoordinate hemoglobin family and acts as a dynamic mediator of redox homeostasis. We observed that Cygb is significantly deregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and its decrease aggravates the growth of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) and increases the subpopulation of CD133(+) LCSCs. Cygb restoration inhibits HCC proliferation and LCSC growth, and decreases the subpopulation of CD133 (+) LCSCs in vitro. We found that Cygb absence promotes LCSC phenotypes and PI3\\xe2\\x80\\x89K/AKT activation, whereas Cygb restoration inhibits LCSC phenotypes and PI3\\xe2\\x80\\x89K/AKT activation. Furthermore, exogenous antioxidants can eliminate the inhibitory effect of Cygb to LCSC growth and phenotypes, as well as PI3\\xe2\\x80\\x89K/AKT activation. Collectively, this study demonstrated that cytoglobin functions as a tumor suppressor and targets CSCs at an ONS-dependent manner. Thus, Cygb restoration could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy against HCC with aberrant ROS/RNS accumulation. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore whether manual acupuncture stimulation of "Shenshu " (BL23), "Guanyuan" (CV4), "Zhongwan" (CV12) can improve the ovarian function by resisting oxidant stress and reducing apoptosis of granulosa cells in rats with ovarian hypofunction.METHODS: Forty female SD rats with normal estrous cycles were randomly divided into blank control, model, hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (n=10 rats in each group). The ovarian hypofunction model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides suspension (50 mg\\xc2\\xb7kg-1\\xc2\\xb7d-1) for 14 successive days. Rats of the hormone therapy group were treated by gavage of estrogen and progesterone, and those of the acupuncture group treated by manual acupuncture stimulation of bilateral BL23 or CV4 and CV12 alternatively by using uniform reinforcing-reducing method for 10 s every 5 min (3 times in 10 min). The treatment was performed once daily for 14 days. The blank group was given equal volume of normal saline daily. On the 9th day, the estrous cycle of each rat was observed by means of vaginal smear test. The ovarian index, serum estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were detected by ELISA. Histopathological changes of the ovary tissue were observed by H.E. staining. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 and their mRNAs of the ovaries were determined by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real time-PCR separately.RESULTS: The menstrual disorder rate was 100% in the model group, and was significantly higher than those in the hormone therapy (30%) and acupuncture (40%) groups (P<0.01). Following modeling, the ovarian wet weight and index, E2 and SOD contents, Bcl-2 protein and mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and serum FSH, LH and MDA levels, Bax protein and mRNA expressions were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01) in the model group in comparison with the blank control group. H.E. staining showed a large amount of connective tissue in the ovary, with fewer mature follicles, increase of atresia follicles, significant reduction of luteal tissue, and appearance of scarring tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, there were more mature follicles, fewer atresia follicles, lower abnormal granulosa cell morphology and lower estrous cycle disorder ratio in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups. After the interventions, the decreased ovarian wet weight and index, serum E2 and SOD contents, expressions of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the increased levels of FSH and LH, MDA, expressions of Bax protein and mRNA were significantly decreased in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The effect of acupuncture was significantly superior to that of hormone in up-regulating SOD, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expressions (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve the menstrual disorder in rats with ovarian hypofunction, which is closely related to its effects in improving antioxidant stress ability and regulating the expressions of apoptosis-related protein and mRNA of ovarian gra-nulosa cells. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#Apoptosis#Female#Glycosides#Oxidative Stress#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Tripterygium'
b'\\n             Sub-Saharan Africa is home of 85 % of pregnant women living with HIV and 90 % of HIV-infected children. WHO issued the first prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) recommendations in 2000. These guidelines have been revised to incorporate new evidence and align with the goal of universal treatment access and zero infections among children. Currently, 82 % of HIV-infected pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment, and infections among children have halved since 2010. However, in 2018, 160,000 children became infected. Reasons hindering the success of PMTCT are: a) non-universal HIV testing during pregnancy; b) low retention through the PMTCT cascade; and c) missed opportunities to diagnose women who acquire HIV while pregnant or breastfeeding. To address these gaps innovative strategies are needed.\\n           labels: #Anti-HIV Agents#Child#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical#Mass Screening#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Complications, Infectious'
b"Objective: To explore the development trajectories of quality of life and acceptance of disability of burn patients in the rehabilitation treatment stage and the influencing factors. Methods: Totally 207 burn patients, including 157 males and 50 females, aged (40\\xc2\\xb113) years, who were in the rehabilitation treatment stage were selected by convenient sampling method from October 2016 to July 2017 in the Department of Burns of Fujian Medical University Union Hospital for this longitudinal study. At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the patient's quality of life and acceptance of disability were scored using the Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief and Chinese Version of Acceptance of Disability Scale-Revised respectively. Taking the intercept, the slope, and the curve slope as latent variables, the latent second growth curve model was constructed for the quality of life and the acceptance of disability. The robust maximum likelihood estimation (MLR) method was used to estimate the mean, the variance, and the covariance, so as to analyze the discharge level, the growth rate, the acceleration, and the correlation among them. Taking the acceptance of disability, the gender, the cause of burn, the severity of burn, the existence of complications, the payment way, and the education level as covariates, the latent second growth curve model was constructed for the quality of life. The MLR method was used to estimate the influence of covariates on the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of the quality of life. Results: At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the quality of life scores of patients were (102\\xc2\\xb136), (111\\xc2\\xb136), (118\\xc2\\xb137), and (122\\xc2\\xb137) points respectively, and the acceptance of disability scores were (73\\xc2\\xb117), (75\\xc2\\xb117), (77\\xc2\\xb117), and (78\\xc2\\xb118) points respectively. The estimated mean intercept of the quality of life and the acceptance of disability were 101.680 and 72.993 respectively at discharge, both of which showed a curve increasing trend in 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge (estimated mean slope=11.024, 3.086, t=15.376, 7.476, P<0.01), and the increasing rate (acceleration) gradually slowed down (estimated mean curve slope=-1.393, -0.426, t=-13.339, -4.776, P<0.01). There were significant individual differences in the discharge level and the acceleration of quality of life of patients (estimated intercept variance=1 174.527, t=9.332; estimated curve slope variance=2.379, t=6.402; P<0.01). There were significant individual differences in the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of patients' acceptance of disability (estimated intercept variance=267.017, t=9.262; estimated slope variance=32.264, t=2.356; estimated curve slope variance=0.882, t=2.939; P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was no significant correlation among the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of the quality of life and those of the acceptance of disability of patients (estimated intercept and slope=37.273, -1.457, t=0.859, -0.131; estimated intercept and curve slope=-6.712, -0.573, t=-1.089, -0.248; estimated slope and curve slope=-5.494, -5.988, t=-0.930, -2.512; P>0.05). Among the time-constant covariates, only the severity of burn and the presence of complications had a significant impact on the quality of life of patients at discharge (estimated intercept=-10.721, 5.522, t=-6.229, 1.977, P<0.05 or P<0.01). At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the level of acceptance of disability had a positive impact on the quality of life of patients (standardized regression coefficient=0.616, 0.669, 0.681, 0.678, t=18.874, 21.660, 22.824, 22.123, P<0.01). Conclusions: The initial levels of quality of life and acceptance of disability of burn patients in the rehabilitation treatment stage are relatively low, both with a curve increasing trend over time, and the increasing rate gradually slows down. Patients with complications and serious burns have poor quality of life at discharge, while the acceptance of disability has a positive impact on the quality of life. labels: #Adaptation, Psychological#Adult#Burns#Disabled Persons#Female#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Middle Aged#Quality of Life"
b"Objective: To understand the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of chronic critical illness (CCI) in China. Methods: The clinical data of 472 adult patients admitted to ICU in 53 hospitals, including basic information, disease-related data, nutrition program, etc., were collected on May 10, 2019, by means of multi-center cross-sectional study. If surgical intervention was needed or the occurrence of the disease was directly related to the surgery, ICU patients were regarded as surgical ICU cases (n=211). In this study, the diagnostic criteria for CCI were: (1) admission to ICU >14 days;(2) combined with persistent organ dysfunction. The prevalence,distribution and treatment of CCI and surgery-related CCI were recorded and analyzed. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used for comparative analysis. Results: Among the 472 ICU patients from 53 hospitals, 326 were male (69.1%) and 146 were female (30.9%). The prevalence of CCI was 30.7% (145/472). Among 211 surgery-related ICU patients, 57 developed CCI with a prevalence of 27.0%. As compared to non-CCI patients, higher APACHE II score [median (IQR) 13.5 (10.0, 18.3) vs. 11.0 (7.0, 16.0), U=2970.000, P=0.007], higher Charlson comorbidity index [median (IQR) 4.0 (2.0, 7.0) vs. 3.0 (1.0, 5.0), U= 3570.000, P=0.036] and higher ratio of breath dysfunction [68.4% (39/57) vs. 48.1% (74/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=6.939, P=0.008] and renal dysfunction [42.1% (24/57) vs. 18.2% (28/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=12.821, P<0.001] were found in surgery-related CCI patients. While SOFA score, Glasgow coma score and other visceral function were not significantly different between surgery-related CCI and non-CCI patients (all P>0.05). NUTRIC score showed that surgery-related CCI patients had higher nutritional risk [43.9% (25/57) vs. 26.6%(41/154), U=5.750, P=0.016] and higher ratio of mechanical ventilation [66.7% (38/57) vs. 52.3% (79/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.977, P=0.046] than non-CCI patients. On the survey day, the daily caloric requirements of 50.2% (106/211) of surgery-related ICU patients were calculated according to the standard adult caloric intake index (104.6 to 125.5 kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), 1 kJ=0.239 kcal), and the daily caloric requirements of 46.4% (98/211) of patients were calculated by physicians according to the severity of the patient's condition. 60.2% (127/211) of nutritional support therapy was enteral nutrition (including a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition), while the remaining patients received parenteral nutrition (24.6%, 52/211), simple glucose infusion (9.0%, 19/211), or oral diet (6.2%, 13/211). The target calorie of CCI group was 104.6 (87.9, 125.5) kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), and the actual calorie intake accounted for 0.98 (0.80, 1.00) of the target calory. In the non-CCI group, the target calorie was 104.6 (87.9, 125.5) kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), and the actual calorie consumed accounted for 0.91 (0.66, 1.00) of the target calorie. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups (P=0.248, P=0.150). Conclusion: The prevalence of CCI and surgery-related CCI in ICU is high, along with severe complications, respiratory and renal dysfunction and mechanical ventilation. Surgical patients admitted to ICU are at high nutritional risk, and active and correct nutritional support is essential for such patients. labels: #Adult#China#Chronic Disease#Critical Illness#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intensive Care Units#Male#Nutritional Support#Surgical Procedures, Operative"
b'Objective: To clarify the effect of TRAF2 in the biological behavior of gastric cancer and explore the mechanism. Methods: TRAF2 stably depleted AGS cell was established. Cell growth was monitored by x-CELLigence system. Cell proliferation was detected using cell viability assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. The difference of migration and invasion abilities were measured by real-time xCELLigence system and Transwell. The expression and activity of NF-\\xc3\\xaaB signaling pathway were measured by western blot and TransAM assay. The expression of TRAF2 in gastric cancer tissue and its clinical significance were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The cell index of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was significantly lower than that of AGS-sictrl cells at 8 h. In the cell viability assay, the A values of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were 51 296.00\\xc2\\xb12 631.06, 68 389.25\\xc2\\xb16 703.21 and 65 559.50\\xc2\\xb16 339.22 at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The values of the viability of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were significantly lower than those of AGS-sictrl cells (P<0.001). The results of flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis rates of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were (1.42\\xc2\\xb10.07)%, (2.98\\xc2\\xb10.11)% and (1.56\\xc2\\xb10.03)% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of AGS-sictrl cells (all P<0.05). The distribution of S phase in AGS-siTRAF2 cells was (23.57\\xc2\\xb11.12)%, while that in the AGS-sictrl cells was (19.49\\xc2\\xb11.19)%. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). AGS-siTRAF2 cells migrated much slower than AGS-sictrl cells from 3 h and the number of migrated AGS-sictrl cells was 121.7\\xc2\\xb16.7 while that of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was 84.0\\xc2\\xb16.6 (P=0.002). The cell index of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was less than that of AGS-sictrl cells from 3 h. In Transwell assay, the number of invaded AGS-sictrl cells was 109.3\\xc2\\xb13.1 after 24 h of culture, significantly higher than 79.0\\xc2\\xb16.2 of AGS-siTRAF2 cells (P=0.002). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of RelA, RelB, p50 and p52 in AGS-siTRAF2 cells were significantly lower than those in AGS-sictrl cells. The activities of RelA, RelB, p50 and p52 in AGS-siTRAF2 cells were 0.01\\xc2\\xb10.00, 0.01\\xc2\\xb10.01, 0.92\\xc2\\xb10.01 and 0.53\\xc2\\xb10.03, respectively, significantly lower than those of AGS-sictrl cells (all P<0.001). High TRAF2 expression (TRAF2-high) was found in 53.0% of GC samples, while TRAF2-high was only observed in 38.0% of the paired adjacent tissues (P=0.033). The expression of TRAF2 was significantly higher in the tubular adenocarcinoma, poor differentiation advanced T, advanced N, and clinical staging (P<0.05). The median survival time were 17 months and 78 months in the TRAF2 high-expression and low-expression groups, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.010). Conclusions: Depletion of TRAF2 inhibits the AGS cell growth, migration and invasion. The expression of TRAF2 is increased in gastric tumor tissue. The expression of TRAF2 is associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer. labels: #Apoptosis#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Humans#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Signal Transduction#Stomach Neoplasms#TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2'
b'The identity of the specific nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) that serves as the main in vivo regulator of O2-dependent NO degradation in smooth muscle remains elusive. Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a recently discovered globin expressed in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells with unknown function. Cygb, coupled with a cellular reducing system, efficiently regulates the rate of NO consumption by metabolizing NO in an O2-dependent manner with decreased NO consumption in physiological hypoxia. Here we show that Cygb is a major regulator of NO degradation and cardiovascular tone. Knockout of Cygb greatly prolongs NO decay, increases vascular relaxation, and lowers blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. We further demonstrate that downregulation of Cygb prevents angiotensin-mediated hypertension. Thus, Cygb has a critical role in the regulation of vascular tone and disease. We suggest that modulation of the expression and NOD activity of Cygb represents a strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'This study was conducted to clarify the role of cytoglobin (Cygb), a globin expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), in the development of liver fibrosis and cancer in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Cygb expression was assessed in patients with NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mouse NASH model was generated in Cygb-deficient (Cygb(-/-)) or wild-type (WT) mice by giving a choline-deficient amino acid-defined diet and, in some of them, macrophage deletion and N-acetyl cysteine treatment were used. Primary-cultured mouse HSCs isolated from WT (HSCs(Cygb-wild)) or Cygb(-/-) (HSCs(Cygb-null)) mice were characterized. As results, the expression of CYGB was reduced in patients with NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma. Choline-deficient amino acid treatment for 8 weeks induced prominent inflammation and fibrosis in Cygb(-/-) mice, which was inhibited by macrophage deletion. Surprisingly, at 32 weeks, despite no tumor formation in the WT mice, all Cygb(-/-) mice developed liver cancer, which was ameliorated by N-acetyl cysteine treatment. Altered expression of 31 genes involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species was notable in Cygb(-/-) mice. Both HSCs(Cygb-null) and Cygb siRNA-transfected-HSCs(Cygb-wild) exhibited the preactivation condition. Our findings provide important insights into the role that Cygb, expressed in HSCs during liver fibrosis, plays in cancer development with NASH. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Evidence concerning an association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is inconclusive. Data were analyzed retrospectively from 297 consecutive heart transplants between 1.1.2002 and 31.12.2012. Patients ?18 years of age, survival, and follow-up ?1-year post-transplant and patients with early CAV were excluded. CMV-infection was diagnosed and monitored closely in the first year. CAV was diagnosed by coronary angiography via left heart catheterization, and results were categorized according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) scoring system. Risk factors for CAV were tested in a multivariable model. Median follow-up was 7.5 years (IQR: 5.6-10.3). CMV infection in the first year after transplantation occurred in 26% of patients (n = 78), CMV disease in 5% (n = 15). CAV ?1 ISHLT was detected in 36% (n = 108). Incidence of CAV >1 ISHLT and severity of CAV increased over time. No statistically significant association between CMV infection and disease within the first year and risk of CAV after 1-year post-HTx was detected in the univariate (P = 0.16) and multivariable [hazard ratio (HR), 1.36; confidence interval (CI), 0.89-2.07; P = 0.16] Cox regression. In the multivariable Cox regression, donor age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; P < 0.01) and acute cellular rejection (ACR) ?2R in the first year after HTx (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.06-2.95; P = 0.03) were independent risk factors for CAV development. In our cohort, CMV infection and disease in the first year after transplantation did not significantly influence the risk of CAV in the long-term follow-up. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'\\n             Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the top 10 infectious diseases with highest mortality globally since the 1990s despite effective chemotherapy. Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography - nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania - has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30-50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis. More efforts need to be placed if we are to reduce the death toll by 90 % until 2030.\\n           labels: #Adult#Child#Diagnostic Tests, Routine#Humans#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tanzania#Tuberculosis'
b'AIM: The colour stability of the silicone is essential for the longevity of facial prostheses. This in vitro study investigates the colour degradation of two different skin shade silicones moulded in Type II and Type III dental stone.METHODS & MATERIALS: Two different types of dental stone were used to fabricate 168 silicone samples (n=42 for each group) using M511 maxillofacial silicone, which was coloured with Spectromatch Procolourants. The polymerisation was carried out at 85\\xc2\\xb0C 1.5 hours. A spectrophotometer was used to record the colour differences (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85) of each group before and after polymerisation. The CIEL*a*b* formula was used to obtain the measurements and a one-way ANOVA was carried out for the statistical analysis of the data.RESULTS: There is a statistically significant colour difference (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85) for all groups. For the Afro-Caribbean skin tone, Type III dental stone demonstrated the greatest colour change (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 = 4.36), whereas, for the Caucasian skin tone, it was the Type II dental stone (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 = 2.21).CONCLUSION: This study showed that regardless of the investing material, the colour of the silicone lightens after polymerisation. Both types of dental stone resulted in visible colour changes, with a \\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 ranging from 1.64 - 4.36. labels: #Caribbean Region#Color#Materials Testing#Maxillofacial Prosthesis#Silicone Elastomers#Skin Pigmentation'
b'he aim of this study was to obtain a cell-penetrating cytoglobin (Cygb), which combines the transmembrane function of cell-penetrating peptides TAT with the anti-aging and anti-fibrotic role of cytoglobin. The Cygb gene was complexed with TAT gene by overlapping PCR, inserted into the vector pET22b to construct the recombinant expression plasmid (pET22b-TAT-Cygb) and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The fusion protein TAT-Cygb, whose expression was induced by lactose, was purified by CM Sepharose Fast Flow Protocol and verified by Western blotting. The final TAT-Cygb had a molecular weight of 23 kDa with 95% purity, as shown by SDS-PAGE. As demonstrated by bioactivity experiments, TAT-Cygb exhibited a high specific peroxidase activity up to (422.30 \\xc2\\xb1 0.36) U/mg. Both TAT-Cygb and Cygb pretreatment group could protect Hacat cells against oxidation of H2O2, but only TAT-Cygb treatment group could remedy cells injuried by H2O2 (RGR = 98%), which was significantly different from Cygb treatment group (RGR = 79%). We successfully obtained the bioactive and cell-penetrating fusion protein TAT-Cygb that has the potential application in anti-aging, anti-fibrotic and anti-cancer. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a member of the hemoglobin family and is thought to protect against cellular hypoxia and oxidative stress. These functions may be particularly important in inflammation-induced cancer, e.g., in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, we investigated the development of inflammation and tumors in a murine model of inflammation-induced colorectal cancer using a combined treatment of azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium. A bioinformatics analysis of genome-wide expression data revealed increased colonic inflammation at the molecular level accompanied by enhanced macroscopic tumor development in Cygb-deficient mice. Moreover, the expression of the UC-associated gene neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family member 4 (Nxpe4) depended on the presence of Cygb in the inflamed colonic mucosa. Compared to wild type mice, RT-qPCR confirmed a 14-fold (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.0003) decrease in Nxpe4 expression in the inflamed colonic mucosa from Cygb-deficient mice. An analysis of Cygb protein expression suggested that Cygb is expressed in fibroblast-like cells surrounding the colonic crypts. Histological examinations of early induced lesions suggested that the effect of Cygb is primarily at the level of tumor promotion. In conclusion, in this model, Cygb primarily seemed to inhibit the development of established microadenomas. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of moxibustion pretreatment at different time on serum hormone levels in diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) rats, so as to explore its protective mechanisms.METHODS: Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, moxibustion-1 (moxibustion was given 4 weeks before modeling), moxibustion-2 (moxibustion was given 2 weeks before modeling and 2 weeks from the 1st day on after modeling ) and moxibustion-3 (moxibustion was given 4 weeks from the 1st day on after modeling) groups (n=8 rats in each group). The DOR model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides (75 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. Grain-moxibustion was applied to "Shenshu" (BL23) and "Guanyuan" (CV4) for 7 cones, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The body weight and the ovary weight were recorded for calculating the ovarian index. The levels of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), androgen (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were detected by ELISA.RESULTS: After modeling, ovarian index and serum AMH levels were obviously decreased (P<0.05), and the levels of serum FSH, E2, T and DHEA were significantly increased in contrast with the control group (P<0.05). Following intervention and compared with the model group, the serum FSH and DHEA levels of each moxibustion group were significantly reduced (P<0.05), the AMH levels significantly increased and E2 and T contents significantly decreased in the moxibustion-2 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05). The serum FSH, E2 and T contents in moxibustion-2 group were obviously lower than those of the moxibustion-1 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Moxibustion pre-treatment can improve ovarian reserve function in DOR rats, while the effect is different with different intervention time, and the best intervention time is pre-occurrence and early stage of DOR. labels: #Animals#Female#Follicle Stimulating Hormone#Moxibustion#Ovarian Reserve#Ovary#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b"Objective: To investigate the clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hypertrophic port-wine stain (PWS). Methods: Cases of hypertrophic PWS, collected from Henan Provincial People's Hospital between 2012 and 2018, were retrospectively analyzed for their clinical and pathologic features, immunophenotype and histochemical data, and the relevant literature was reviewed. Results: Twenty-four cases of PWS were included in this cohort, located in the head and neck region (20 cases), limbs (2 cases), and trunk (2 cases). The clinical presentations were mainly red or purple-red plaques or slow growing, painless nodules, or thickened and raised above the skin surface. Microscopically, deformed blood vessels showed honeycomb-like, plexiform or cluster-like growth pattern, and diffusely involved the dermis, skin appendages, subcutaneous fat tissue, and deep skeletal muscles; The vascular lumen of the deformed vessels was dilated (?100 \\xc3\\xacm in diameter), and in 18 cases the lumen was greater than 400 \\xc3\\xacm. The superficial dermis mainly contained few deformed capillaries. The deep wall showed thickening of blood vessel wall and fibrous tissue hyperplasia. Elastic fiber and Masson staining indicated abnormal venous vessel, which in some cases contained small amount of abnormal arterioid vessel,without vascular endothelial cell proliferation in all cases. In 24 cases, 19 cases had epidermal atrophy, 6 with vascular chronic inflammation or epidermal ulcer, 4 with capillary hemangioma, 4 with sebaceous gland hyperplasia, 2 with epidermal papillary hyperplasia and 2 with vascular keratomas. Conclusions: PWS is a common congenital capillary malformation. The number of histologically deformed capillaries is reduced and they usually locate in the superficial part. The deep vascular wall is increased with thick venous malformation, diffusely involving the dermis and deep skeletal muscle. Furthermore, PWS needs to be differentiated from infantile hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma and vascular keratomas. labels: #Humans#Port-Wine Stain#Retrospective Studies#Skin"
b"Objective: The aim of the current study is to compare the short-term clinical outcomes between Billroth-I reconstruction using an overlap method and delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG). Method: A retrospective cohort study was performed. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) Preoperative gastroscopy and CT confirmed that the tumor is located in the antrum of the stomach, and the biopsy suggested adenocarcinoma; (2) Chest, abdomen and pelvis enhanced CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis; (3) Preoperative gastric reconstruction CT or endoscopic ultrasonography suggested that the clinical stage of the tumor is stage I-III. (4) During the operation, the tumor position was confirmed to be located in the antrum of the stomach by nanocarbon injection or gastroscope; (5) Complete laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for distal gastrectomy, and the gastrointestinal reconstruction was performed by delta-shaped anastomosis or overlap anastomosis. And the following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) History of gastric surgery; (2) Patients who cannot tolerate laparoscopic surgery because of comorbidities. Finally, data on 43 consecutive patients who underwent TLDG with Billroth-I reconstruction between January 2016 and November 2018 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into those who underwent Billroth-I reconstruction using an overlap method (n=20) or using delta-shaped anastomosis (n=23). The demographic and clinical characteristics and perioperative data of the two groups were analyzed. Measurement data that conformed to the normal distribution were expressed as the mean \\xc2\\xb1 s, and differences between groups were compared using Student's t-test; comparisons between the counting data groups were performed using the \\xc3\\xb7(2) test or the continuously corrected \\xc3\\xb7(2) test. Results: The demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the delta-shaped group and the overlap group (P>0.05). There was no significant difference between groups regarding operation time [(185.9\\xc2\\xb122.8) minutes vs. (184.0\\xc2\\xb125.8) minutes, t=0.260, P=0.796], blood loss [(50.9\\xc2\\xb136.0) ml vs. (47.0\\xc2\\xb130.8) ml, t=0.375, P=0.709], number of stapler reloads used for anastomosis (5.1\\xc2\\xb10.3 vs. 5.2\\xc2\\xb10.6, t=-0.465, P=0.651), time to flatus [(3.3\\xc2\\xb10.9) days vs. (3.6\\xc2\\xb10.9) days, t=-1.067, P=0.292) and postoperative hospitalization [(8.8\\xc2\\xb13.1) days vs. (10.4\\xc2\\xb13.8) days,t=-1.494, P=0.143]. As for the delta-shaped group and the overlap group, the anastomotic leakage rate was 4.3% (1/23) and 0 (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000), respectively. The incidence of anastomotic bleeding was 4.3% (1/23) and 5.0% (1/20) (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000), while the incidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage was 4.3% (1/23) and 0 (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000). The incidence of gastric emptying disorders was 4.3% (1/23) and 30.0% (6/20), respectively (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.454, P=0.063). All complications were cured after conservative treatment or symptomatic treatment. Conclusion: The overlap method for Billroth-I reconstruction is safe and feasible. labels: #Gastrectomy#Gastroenterostomy#Humans#Laparoscopy#Retrospective Studies#Stomach Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome"
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexa-co-ordinate haem protein from the globin superfamily with a physiological function that is unclear. We have previously reported that the haem co-ordination is changed in the presence of lipids, potentially transforming the redox properties of the protein and hence the function of Cygb in vivo. Recent research suggests that the protein can exist in a number of states depending on the integrity and position of disulfide bonds. In the present study, we show that the monomeric protein with an internal disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues Cys38 and Cys83, interacts with lipids to induce a change in haem co-ordination. The dimeric protein with intermolecular disulfide bonds and monomeric protein without an intramolecular disulfide bond does not exhibit these changes in haem co-ordination. Furthermore, monomeric Cygb with an intramolecular disulfide bond has significantly different properties, oxidizing lipid membranes and binding ligands more rapidly as compared with the other forms of the protein. The redox state of these cysteine residues in vivo is therefore highly significant and may be a mechanism to modulate the biochemical properties of the haem under conditions of stress. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Scar contracture after burn on the back of hand can easily lead to the limitation of flexion function of fingers, which seriously affects daily life activities. Generally, comprehensive rehabilitation treatment is adopted for scar contracture on the back of hand, among which wearing braces is an effective treatment method. However, some braces will limit the normal finger joints or must wait until all the affected fingers heal before they can be worn, and the wearing operation is quite complicated. In order to solve these problems, the author designed and made a finger flexion band, which was used to stretch the patients with limited flexion of finger caused by scar contracture after burn on the back of hand, and achieved good therapeutic effect. According to the measured hand size, the finger flexion band is cut and spliced from the fabric commonly used in daily life. The finger flexion band is designed with finger sleeve, which will not limit the normal finger joints, can interfere with the healed finger in advance, fix the corresponding fingers better, and improve the treatment comfort, especially for children who do not cooperate with the braces wearing. This finger flexion band is simple to make, cheap, convenient to use, and suitable for clinical promotion. labels: #Burns#Cicatrix#Contracture#Fingers#Hand Injuries#Humans#Orthotic Devices'
b'Oxygen (O2) is required for cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent drug metabolism. Cytoglobin (CYGB) is a unique globin expressed exclusively in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). However, its role in O2-dependent metabolism in neighboring hepatocytes remains unknown. This study provides evidence that CYGB in HSCs is involved in acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol; APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in wild-type mice than in Cygb-null mice. Wild-type mice exhibited more severe hepatocyte necrosis around the central vein area compared with Cygb-null mice, thus indicating that CYGB deficiency protects against APAP-induced liver damage. Although no difference in the hepatic expression of CYP2E1, a key enzyme involved in APAP toxicity, was observed between wild-type and Cygb-null mice, the serum levels of the APAP metabolites cysteinyl-APAP and N-acetyl-cysteinyl-APAP were decreased in Cygb-null mice, suggesting reduced APAP metabolism in the livers of Cygb-null mice. In primary cultures, APAP-induced hepatocyte damage was increased by co-culturing with wild-type HSCs but not with Cygb-null HSCs. In addition, cell damage was markedly alleviated under low O2 condition (5% O2), suggesting the requirement of O2 for APAP toxicity. Carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury (CYP2E1-dependent), but not lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine-induced injury (CYP2E1-independent), was similarly alleviated in Cygb-null mice. Considering the function of CYGB as O2 carrier, these results strongly support the hypothesis that HSCs are involved in the CYP2E1-mediated xenobiotic activation by augmenting O2 supply to hepatocytes. In conclusion, CYGB in HSCs contributes to the CYP-mediated metabolism of xenobiotics in hepatocytes by supplying O2 for enzymatic oxidation.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a member of the hexacoordinated globin protein family and is expressed ubiquitously in rat and human tissues. Although Cygb is reportedly upregulated under hypoxic conditions both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a physiological function to protect cells under hypoxic/ischemic conditions by scavenging reactive oxygen species or by signal transduction, the mechanisms associated with this function have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies comparing Cygbs among several species suggest that mammalian Cygbs show a distinctly longer C-terminal domain potentially involved in unique physiological functions. In this study, we prepared human Cygb mutants (\\xc3\\x84C, \\xc3\\x84N, and \\xc3\\x84NC) with either one or both terminal domains truncated and investigated the enzymatic functions and structural features by spectroscopic methods. Evaluation of the superoxide-scavenging activity between Cygb variants showed that the \\xc3\\x84C and \\xc3\\x84NC mutants exhibited slightly higher activity involving superoxide scavenging as compared with wild-type Cygb. Subsequent experiments involving ligand titration, flash photolysis, and resonance Raman spectroscopic studies suggested that the truncation of the C- and N-terminal domains resulted in less effective to dissociation constants and binding rates for carbon monoxide, respectively. Furthermore, structural stability was assessed by guanidine hydrochloride and revealed that the C-terminal domain might play a vital role in improving structure, whereas the N-terminal domain did not exert a similar effect. These findings indicated that long terminal domains could be important not only in regulating enzymatic activity but also for structural stability, and that the domains might be relevant to other hypothesized physiological functions for Cygb. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'PURPOSE: Short implants are a minimally invasive alternative in the management of alveolar bone atrophy. This study aimed to assess the influence of the surgical approach (1-stage vs 2-stage) on the 15-year survival and marginal bone loss of short implants in a fixed complete denture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was conducted in a single private dental clinic that included short implants placed between January 2001 and December 2002.RESULTS: Forty-one short implants supported 18 screw-retained complete dentures. The mean follow-up time was 15 \\xc2\\xb1 3 years. The surgical approach (1-stage vs 2-stage) did not significantly affect implant survival and marginal bone loss. The implant survival rate was 90.2%.CONCLUSIONS: Short dental implants could be predictably indicated to support fixed complete dentures. The implants could be placed through a 1- or 2-stage surgery. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Implants#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Jaw, Edentulous#Mandible#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b"Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for chronic radiation intestinal injury. Methods: A descriptive cohort study was performed. Clinical data of 73 patients with definite radiation history and diagnosed clinically as chronic radiation intestinal injury, undergoing operation at Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 1, 2012 to February 28, 2019, were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Patients did not undergo operation or only received adhesiolysis were excluded. All the patients had preoperative examination and overall evaluation of the disease. According to severity of intestinal obstruction and patients' diet, corresponding nutritional support and conservative treatment were given. Surgical methods: The one-stage bowel resection and anastomosis was the first choice for surgical treatment of chronic radiation intestinal injury. Patients with poor nutritional condition were given enterostomy and postoperative enteral nutrition and second-stage stoma closure and intestinal anastomosis if nutritional condition improved. For those who were unable to perform stoma closure, a permanent stoma should be performed. Patients with severe abdominal adhesion which was difficult to separate, enterostomy or bypass surgery after adhesiolysis would be the surgical choice. For patients with tumor metastasis or recurrence, enterostomy or bypass surgery should be selected. Observation parameters: the overall and major (Clavien-Dindo grades III to V) postoperative complication within 30 days after surgery or during hospitalization; mortality within postoperative 30 days; postoperative hospital stay; time to postoperative recovery of enteral nutrition; time to removal of drainage tube. Results: Of the 73 patients who had been enrolled in this study, 10 were male and 63 were female with median age of 54 (range, 34-80) years. Preoperative evaluation showed that 61 patients had intestinal stenosis, 63 had intestinal obstruction, 11 had intestinal perforation, 20 had intestinal fistula, 3 had intestinal bleeding, and 6 had abdominal abscess, of whom 64(87.7%) patients had multiple complications. Tumor recurrence or metastasis was found in 15 patients. A total of 65(89.0%) patients received preoperative nutritional support, of whom 35 received total parenteral nutrition and 30 received partial parenteral nutrition. The median preoperative nutritional support duration was 8.5 (range, 6.0-16.2) days. The rate of one-stage intestine resection was 69.9% (51/73), and one-stage enterostomy was 23.3% (17/73). In the 51 patients undergoing bowel resection, the average length of resected bowel was (50.3\\xc2\\xb149.1) cm. Among the 45 patients with intestinal anastomosis, 4 underwent manual anastomosis and 41 underwent stapled anastomosis; 36 underwent side-to-side anastomosis, 5 underwent end-to-side anastomosis, and 4 underwent end-to-end anastomosis. Eighty postoperative complications occurred in 39 patients and the overall postoperative complication rate was 53.4% (39/73), including 39 moderate to severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-V) in 20 patients (27.4%, 20/73) and postoperative anastomotic leakage in 2 patients (2.7%, 2/73). The mortality within postoperative 30 days was 2.7% (2/73); both patients died of abdominal infection, septic shock, and multiple organ failure caused by anastomotic leakage. The median postoperative hospital stay was 13 (11, 23) days, the postoperative enteral nutrition time was (7.2\\xc2\\xb16.9) days and the postoperative drainage tube removal time was (6.3\\xc2\\xb14.2) days. Conclusions: Surgical treatment, especially one-stage anastomosis, is safe and feasible for chronic radiation intestine injury. Defining the extent of bowel resection, rational selection of the anatomic position of the anastomosis and perioperative nutritional support treatment are the key to reduce postoperative complications. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Anastomosis, Surgical#Anastomotic Leak#Chronic Disease#Enterostomy#Female#Humans#Intestinal Diseases#Intestines#Male#Middle Aged#Nutrition Assessment#Nutritional Status#Radiation Injuries#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'Objective: To investigate the characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) of cervix, and improve the diagnostic accuracy of MDA. Methods: The imaging data of eight cases of MDA was retrospectively collected, including tumor size, tumor location, tumor components, signal characteristics, enhancement characteristics and invasive extent. Results: The maximum diameter of tumor was (4.36\\xc2\\xb11.46) cm. Six tumors were mixed solid and cystic and two were predominantly solid. Six were diffusion limited on diffusion-weighted imaging, and two were not diffusion limited. On multi-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced scan, the enhancement curve of solid components of the tumor showed a plateau-like pattern in three cases and a slow-rising pattern in five cases. Tumors were confined to the cervical canal in three cases, infiltrated to cervical stroma > 1/2 depth in seven cases, and ? 1/2 depth in one case. There were four cases of uterine invasion, four cases of vaginal fornix invasion, four cases of bilateral ovarian metastasis and one case of lymph node metastasis. Conclusions: Patients suffering from large amount of vaginal discharge had cervical lesions on MRI showing polycystic and solid component enhancement should be alert to MDA. Deep-seated cervical biopsy and even conization is conducive to early diagnosis, treatment and improvement of prognosis. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Cervix Uteri#Female#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Retrospective Studies#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b'BACKGROUND: There have been several case-control studies to assess the relationship between the transforming growth factor-\\xc3\\xa21 (TGF-\\xc3\\xa21) T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) gene polymorphism and lung cancer in recent years; however, the results remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the potential correlation between the TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C/C-509T polymorphism and increased risk of lung cancer through meta-analysis.METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library database, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang Data Information Service platform to identify relevant case-control studies in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to evaluate the correlation between TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 gene polymorphism and lung tumor risk. Sensitivity analysis and Egger test were used to evaluate the stability of the results and possible publication bias.RESULTS: A total of 8 studies, with 3680 patients and 4018 controls, were included. The meta-analysis revealed that there was no conspicuous correlation between the TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) variant and lung cancer in the overall population. For TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 C-509T, a significant decreased risk was identified in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the analysis stratified by disease (TT vs CT\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8aCC: P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02, OR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.90). However, for TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C, subgroup analysis showed no correlation between the T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in patients with NSCLC. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no distinct association was observed between T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in the Asian and Caucasian groups. Moreover, no significant association was found in the analysis of groups stratified by age, sex, and smoking history.CONCLUSION: The TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073) and C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphisms are not implicated in lung cancer susceptibility in the overall population. However, our analysis indicated that the C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism decreases the risk of lung cancer in patients with NSCLC. labels: #Case-Control Studies#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Transforming Growth Factor beta1'
b'Dyspnea and exercise intolerance are usually attributed to pulmonary disease in sarcoidosis patients. However, cardiac involvement may also be responsible for these symptoms. Data regarding the impact of heart involvement on lung function in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is limited.The aim of study was to compare the results of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with and without heart involvement. We performed a retrospective analysis of PFTs in a group of sarcoidosis patients both with and without heart involvement evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study. The study was performed in the period between May 2008 and April 2016.We included data of sarcoidosis patients who underwent testing for possible CS (including CMR study) at a national tertiary referral center for patients with interstitial lung diseases. All patients had histopathologicaly confirmed sarcoidosis and underwent standard evaluation with PFTs measurements including spirometry, plethysmography, lung transfer factor (TL,CO), and 6-minute walking test (6MWT) assessed using the most recent predicted values.We identified 255 sarcoidosis patients (93 women, age 42\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a10.7 y): 103 with CS and 152 without CS (controls). CS patients had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 56.9\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a7.0 vs 60.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a5.4, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Any type of lung dysfunction was seen in 63% of CS patients compared with 31% in the controls (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.005). Ventilatory disturbances (obstructive or restrictive pattern) and low TL,CO were more frequent in CS group (52% vs 23%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001 and 38% vs 18% P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.01 respectively). CS (OR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.13, 95% CI: 1.11-4.07, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02), stage of the disease (OR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a3.13, 95% CI: 1.4-7.0, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006) and LVEF (coefficient\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a-0.068\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.027, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.011) were independent factors associated with low FEV1 but not low TL,CO. There was a significant correlation between LVEF and FEV1 in CS group (r\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.31, n\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a89, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.003). No significant difference in 6MWD between CS patients and controls was observed.Lung function impairment was more frequent in CS. Lower LVEF was associated with decreased values of FEV1.

b'Objective: To explore the short-term efficacy and prognosis of palliative surgical treatment for malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) caused by peritoneal metastasis of colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) primary colorectal cancer; (2) massive peritoneal metastasis; (3)obstructive site located below Treitz ligament by imaging; (4) obstruction refractory to conservative treatment; (5) estimated rese survival time more than 2 months; (6) patients and their families had strong willingness for operation; (7) surgical treatment included stoma/bypass and debulking surgery. In accordance with the above criteria, clinicopathological data of 46 patients undergoing palliative surgery at Peking University Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, Unit III from January 2016 to October 2018 were retrospectively collected. Postoperative symptomatic relief rate, morbidity of complication within 30 days, complication classification (Clavien-Dindo classification), mortality and survival after operation were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate survival and Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors. Results: Among 46 patients, 30 were male and 16 were female with median age of 63 (19-87) years; 23 patients received stoma/bypass surgery (stoma/bypass group), and 23 cases received tumor debulking surgery (debulking group). The overall symptom relief rate was 76.1% (35/46), while symptom relief rate in the debulking group was 91.3% (21/23), which was significantly higher than 60.9% (14/23) in the stoma/bypass group (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=4.301, P=0.038). Postoperative complications occurred in 25 patients. The complication rate was 52.2% (12/23) in the debulking group and 56.5% (13/23) in the stoma/bypass group, without statistically significant difference (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.088, P=0.767). Morbidity of complication beyond grade III was 8.7% (2/23) and 13.0% (3/23) in the debulking group and stoma/bypass group respectively, without statistically significant difference (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.224, P=0.636). Four patients died within 30 days after operation, 2 (8.7%) in each group. Twenty-four patients underwent 1-8 cycles of chemotherapy \\xc2\\xb1 targeting therapy (regimens: CapeOX \\xc2\\xb1 Bevacizumab, FOLFOX/FOLFIRI \\xc2\\xb1 Bevacizumab/Cetuximab), including 10 cases in the stoma/bypass group and 14 cases in the debulking group. Two patients of debulking group received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy (50.6 Gy/22 f, with concurrent oral capecitabine). Till the last follow up of April 2019, 34 patients died (34/46, 73.9%) with a median overall survival time of 6.4 months, and the 6-month and 1-year survival rate was 54.5% and 29.2% respectively. The median survival time in the debulking group was significantly longer than that in the stoma/bypass group (11.5 months vs. 5.2 months, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=5.117, P=0.024). The median survival time of the 35 patients with symptomatic relief after operation was significant longer than that of 11 patients without relief (7.1 months vs 5.1 months, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.844, P=0.050). Multivariate analysis showed stoma/bypass surgery (HR=2.917, 95%CI:1.357-6.269, P=0.006) and greater omental metastasis (HR=4.060, 95%CI:1.419-11.617, P=0.009) were independent risk factors associated with prognosis of patients with MBO caused by peritoneal mCRC. Conclusions: For patients of MBO caused by peritoneal mCRC, tumor debulking surgery may achieve higher symptom relief rate and prolong survival. Greater omental metastasis indicates poor prognosis. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Colorectal Neoplasms#Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures#Female#Humans#Intestinal Obstruction#Male#Middle Aged#Omentum#Palliative Care#Peritoneal Neoplasms#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'Objective: To establish a nude mouse model of subcutaneous lung cancer using dual fluorescence reporting genes of luciferase (Luc) and near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP). Methods: The Luc and iRFP expressed lentiviral vector was constructed by Gateway method. After verified by sequencing, the lentivirus particle was prepared and infected into lung cancer A549 cells. Successfully infected A549 (mA549) cells were selected by puromycin and amplified. The expression of Luc and iRFP were observed under fluorescence microscope, and the expression of c-Met protein on the cell surface was detected by immunofluorescence. Twelve female nude mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, 6 in each group. A549 and mA549 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right forelimb of nude mice. The growth and fluorescence expression of the tumor were observed by in vivo imaging. The tumor formation was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry. Results: The Luc and iRFP stably expressed mA549 cell line was successfully constructed. The expressions of iRFP and Luc in mA549 cells were observed under fluorescence microscope. The results of immunofluorescence showed that c-Met protein expressed in both A549 cells and mA549 cells. The growth period of mA549 xenograft in nude mice was moderate and the tumorigenesis rate was 100%. The growth trend of mA549 cells in vivo was not significantly different from that of A549 cells (P>0.05). HE staining and immunohistochemistry results showed that the tumor issues displayed typical histopathological features of tumor. Immunohistochemistry results showed that both A549 and mA549 tumors expressed c-Met protein.

b'Cytoglobin (Cygb), a recently discovered member of the vertebrate globin family, exhibits a traditional globin fold with a three-over-three \\xc3\\xa1-helical sandwich. The interaction between copper(?) ion (Cu2+) and Cygb has been investigated by UV-Vis, fluorescence, synchronous fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Results showed that the absorption intensity of Cygb at 280 nm increased and the intrinsic fluorescence of Cygb was quenched when Cu2+ was added. This fluorescence quenching of Cygb has been proven that it belongs to static quenching. The synchronous fluorescence spectra indicated that there were small changes about the microenvironment of tryptophan residues and tyrosine residues; furthermore, the binding site of Cu2+ is closer to tryptophan residues than tyrosine residues. No obvious change was observed about the secondary structure of Cygb with the addition of Cu2+ from the CD spectra. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) case-based surveillance (CBS) systematically and continuously collects available demographic and health event data (sentinel events*) about persons with HIV infection from diagnosis and, if available, throughout routine clinical care until death, to characterize HIV epidemics and guide program improvement (1,2). Surveillance signals such as high viral load, mortality, or recent HIV infection can be used for rapid public health action. To date, few standardized assessments have been conducted to describe HIV CBS systems globally (3,4). For this assessment, a survey was disseminated during May-July 2019 to all U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported countries with CDC presence\\xe2\\x80\\xa0 (46) to describe CBS implementation and identify facilitators and barriers. Among the 39 (85%) countries that responded,\\xc2\\xa7 20 (51%) have implemented CBS, 15 (38%) were planning implementation, and four (10%)\\xc2\\xb6 had no plans for implementation. All countries with CBS reported capturing information at the point of diagnosis, and 85% captured sentinel event data. The most common characteristic (75% of implementation countries) that facilitated implementation was using a health information system for CBS. Barriers to CBS implementation included lack of country policies/guidance on mandated reporting of HIV and on CBS, lack of unique identifiers to match and deduplicate patient-level data, and lack of data security standards. Although most surveyed countries reported implementing or planning for implementation of CBS, these barriers need to be addressed to implement effective HIV CBS that can inform the national response to the HIV epidemic. labels: #Developing Countries#Global Health#HIV Infections#Humans#International Cooperation#Population Surveillance#United States"
b'Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease characterized by lipid accumulation and endothelial dysfunction. Cytoglobin has been shown to exert protective effects under oxidative stress conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCYGB) has protective effects against atherosclerosis. We intraperitoneally injected rhCYGB (0, 4, or 7 mg/kg BW) into the atherosclerotic rats daily for 60 days. The rhCYGB injections reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in a dose-dependent manner, rhCYGB (7 mg/kg) significantly attenuated atherosclerosis. Blood proteins were separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the majority of the proteins in question were participated in oxidative stress pathways and cardiovascular diseases. Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) cells were treated with oleic acid (0.3 mmol/L), and Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells were incubated with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL; 50 \\xc2\\xb5g/mL) to induce foam cell (FC) formation in vitro. Treatment with different concentrations of rhCYGB (0, 5, 10, and 15 \\xc3\\xacg/mL) significantly decreased the lipid droplet levels in HepG2 cells and cholesterol ester levels in FCs. Moreover, rhCYGB significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity and decreased malondialdehyde and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity in cells. In addition, rhCYGB decreased NO and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in FCs by functioning as an NO dioxygenase enzyme and ROS scavenger. Taken together, our findings indicate that rhCYGB prevented atherosclerosis by regulating lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. Our study provides insights into the possible usefulness of rhCYGB as an antiatherosclerosis agent. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Stress-induced injury is a common complication associated with patients with chronic critical illness (CCI). Skin-stretching device (SSD) and vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) technique are 2 approaches that can facilitate wound healing.In the present study, the effect of the concatenated application of the 2 techniques on the phases III and IV stress-induced injuries in aged patients with CCI was assessed. About 70 patients with CCI with stress-induced injuries were selected from February 2015 to October 2017. The treatment outcomes of the combined method and VSD method were assessed by comparing their clinicopathologic parameters.The results showed that the combined treatment shortened the average healing duration of wounds. Moreover, the total area of pressure sores, incidence of bleeding, bacteria amount, 28-day cure rate, peripheral C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and the hospitalization duration were all significantly improved in patients treated with SSD and VSD. The overall effective rate (97.14%) of patients treated with VSD and SSD was significantly higher than that (77.14%) in patients treated with VSD.The present study showed that the combined application of VSD and SSD improved the treatment outcomes of phases III and IV stress-induced injuries in aged patients with CCI. labels: #Age Factors#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Chronic Disease#Critical Illness#Female#Humans#Male#Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy#Pressure Ulcer#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Stress, Mechanical#Treatment Outcome'
b"Chronic critical illness (CCI) refers to a group of critically ill patients who survive the acute phase of intensive care, but with persistent organ dysfunction, thus entering a chronic period of continuous dependence on life support system, and still need to stay in intensive care unit (ICU) for a long time. Persistent inflammatory response-immunosuppression-catabolic syndrome (PICS) is the main pathophysiological feature of CCI. Three factors interact to form a vicious circle, leading to poor prognosis. Nutritional support therapy is a key link in the comprehensive treatment of CCI. Enteral nutrition (EN) should be started as soon as possible if conditions permit. If EN can not be implemented, temporary or transitional parenteral nutrition (PN) should be used, and EN should be added gradually in time. At the same time, the amount of PN should be gradually reduced. When EN meets more than 60% of patients' energy and protein requirements, PN can be considered to be discontinued. The main strategies and functions of CCI nutritional support therapy are as follows: strengthening high protein supply to correct negative nitrogen balance and inhibit catabolism, selecting branched chain amino acids (BCAA) to promote anabolism, using immunomodulators (arginine, \\xc3\\xb93 polyunsaturated fatty acids) to improve immune suppression and inflammatory response, supplementing micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) to counteract the decrease in intake and the increase in consumption, and adding probiotics to maintain the intestinal microecological balance, and so on. Reasonable nutritional support therapy not only improve malnutrition of CCI patients, but also help to reduce complications, thus speeding up rehabilitation, improving prognosis, shortening ICU hospitalization time, and even reducing mortality. labels: #Chronic Disease#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Nutritional Support"
b'The present study is aimed to clarify the utility of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and the additional value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).This retrospective study involved 38 patients with PDAC concomitant with IPMN and 114 patients (control) who were randomly selected from 320 patients with IPMN without PDAC and were matched with cases for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strength (1.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8aT/3.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8aT). Two radiologists reviewed the 2 MR image sets with relevant clinical information blinded, first MRCP alone and then combined MRI set including DWI. Diagnostic capability and interobserver agreement were assessed by using receiver operating characteristics curve (Az) analysis and weighted \\xc3\\xaa statistics.Az values for the 2 observers were 0.834 and 0.821 for MRCP alone and 0.964 and 0.926 for the combined MRI (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001 and P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), respectively. The sensitivity of MRCP alone was 61% (23/38), with both observers failing to diagnose PDACs located at the end of tail or away from the pancreatic duct. Meanwhile, with combined MRI, sensitivity was significantly increased for both observers (61% to 92%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002; 61% to 87%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.004). Moreover, the interobserver agreement was higher with combined MRI (\\xc3\\xaa\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.85) than MRCP alone (\\xc3\\xaa\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.59).MRCP and DWI might be a superior option with a higher diagnostic capability of PDAC concomitant with IPMN than MRCP alone, especially for tumors away from the pancreatic duct. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal#Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance#Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasms, Multiple Primary#Pancreatic Intraductal Neoplasms#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Retrospective Studies'
b'OBJECTIVES: Access to dental healthcare services is a major determinant of dental health in communities. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the global prevalence of dental needs and of unmet dental needs in adolescents.METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched in June 2018. The summary measures included the prevalence of met and unmet dental needs. A meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method to obtain pooled summary measures. Out of 41,661 retrieved articles, 57 were ultimately included.RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of orthodontic treatment needs was 46.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 53.0), that of general treatment needs was 59.0% (95% CI, 42.0 to 75.0), that of periodontal treatment needs was 71.0% (95% CI, 46.0 to 96.0), and that of malocclusion treatment needs was 39.0% (95% CI, 28.0 to 50.0). The pooled prevalence of unmet dental needs was 34.0% (95% CI, 27.0 to 40.0).CONCLUSIONS: The highest and lowest prevalence of unmet dental needs were found in Southeast Asia and Europe, respectively. The prevalence of dental needs was higher in the countries of the Americas and Europe than in other World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The prevalence of unmet dental needs was higher in Southeast Asia and Africa than in other WHO regions. labels: #Adolescent#Dental Care#Global Health#Health Services Needs and Demand#Humans#Prevalence'
b'Cytoglobin is a widely expressed heme protein that binds oxygen, carbon monoxide and nitric oxide. Recent examination of cytoglobin in the vasculature indicates that it contributes to nitric oxide availability, which is central to normal blood vessel function through regulation of smooth muscle cell tone and physiological response. Given the potential implications of cytoglobin in vascular function, we examined how cytoglobin might be uniquely regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our data demonstrate that endothelial cells can increase the expression of cytoglobin in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the induction of cytoglobin is cell contact-dependent. We show that Notch signaling is necessary for endothelial cell-induced cytoglobin expression and Notch2 and Notch3 are sufficient to drive its expression in aortic smooth muscle cells. We further reveal that in cytoglobin-depleted smooth muscle cells there is increased cellular nitric oxide. These data demonstrate that, in addition to being the main producer of vascular nitric oxide, endothelial cells facilitate the ability of smooth muscle cells to metabolize nitric oxide through upregulation of cytoglobin. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Notch signaling contributes to vascular function through regulation of a gene that controls nitric oxide levels. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'PURPOSE: To analyse and compare the dimensional changes of unassisted extraction sockets with alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) techniques and investigate any factors that impact the resorption of the alveolar bone.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs). All data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed for the changes in all buccolingual ridge width, midbuccal and midlingual ridge height, and mesial and distal ridge height, and horizontal width at reference points apical to the crestal area.RESULTS: Based on 14 RCTs, the effectiveness of ARP in reducing the dimensions of the postextraction alveolar socket was confirmed. The clinical magnitude of this effect was 1.95 mm in the buccolingual ridge width, 1.62 mm in the midbuccal ridge height, and 1.26 mm on the midlingual ridge height. Additionally, 0.45 mm and 0.34 mm for mesial and distal ridge height, and 1.21 mm, and 0.76 mm for ridge width changes at points 3 and 5 mm apical to the crest were noted. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the reflection of flaps and primary wound coverage during ARP may have detrimental effects on bone remodelling, while no statistical significance was observed for any of the bone graft substitutes or the percentage of molar sockets.CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the protocol, ARP can only minimise ridge resorption. ARP is most effective on horizontal ridge width, providing the most benefit coronally (approximating the crest), followed by the midbuccal ridge height. labels: #Alveolar Process#Alveolar Ridge Augmentation#Consensus#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Tooth Extraction#Tooth Socket'
b'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at a higher risk of development of lung cancer. Frequent exacerbations of COPD trigger the disease course to chronic inflammation which likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Previous studies showed influenza virus infection is one of important causes for exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to know whether influenza vaccination could reduce the incidence of lung cancer in patients with COPD.This cohort study enrolled patients (?55 years old) with a recorded diagnosis of COPD between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012 by using the Taiwan Health Insurance Database. A propensity score was calculated to reduce vaccine therapy selection bias. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to investigate the association between the influenza vaccination and lung cancer incidence after adjusting for known confounding factors. Besides, we categorized the patients into 4 groups according to vaccination status (unvaccinated, total number of vaccinations: 1, 2-3, ?4) to evaluate the dose-dependent effect on reducing lung cancer occurrence of lung cancer in COPD patients.Our study comprised of 28,752 eligible individuals from the COPD cohort database. Among them, 51% (14,630) received influenza vaccination; the rest (49%) of the COPD patients did not receive influenza vaccination. We observed that COPD patients receiving influenza vaccination had a lower risk of lung cancer (adjusted HR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.40, 95% CI (0.35-0.45), P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). We also founded comparable protective effect in both sexes and all age groups (55-64, 65-74, ?75) regardless of influenza seasonality. Furthermore, dose-dependent protective effect could be seen after stratifying patients according to the total number vaccinations, the adjusted HRs for lung cancer risk were 0.48 (0.40-0.54) and 0.24 (0.20-0.29) for patients who received 2 to 3 and ?4 vaccinations during the follow-up period.This population-based cohort study demonstrated that annual influenza vaccination administration could reduce incidence of lung cancer in COPD patients. labels: #Aged#Cohort Studies#Disease Progression#Female#Humans#Immunization Schedule#Incidence#Influenza Vaccines#Influenza, Human#Lung Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive'
b'The aim of this research is to investigate the application value of TTE in the diagnosis of the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA).The echocardiographic findings of 11 patients with ALCAPA confirmed by surgery in our hospital from October 2007 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) diagnosis and intraoperative diagnosis.Surgery was performed in all of the patients to establish the dual coronary artery system. Four underwent the Takeuchi procedure and 7 had re-implantation of the anomalous left coronary artery. The CTA diagnoses of the 11 patients were consistent with the surgical diagnoses, and the diagnostic accuracy was 100% (11/11). Echocardiographic diagnosis showed consistent results in 10 cases, while one case was misdiagnosed as endocardial fibroelastosis; the diagnostic accuracy was 90.9% (10/11). The echocardiographic features of these patients with ALCAPA included: abnormal left coronary ostium arising from the pulmonary trunk with retrograde coronary artery flow in 10 patients; enlargement of the right coronary artery in 8 patients; abundant intercoronary septal collaterals in 6 patients; and moderate and significant mitral regurgitation in 7 patients. Echocardiography showed that the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter before surgery were significantly different from those after surgery (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05) and that the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening before surgery were not significantly different from those after surgery (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05).Transthoracic echocardiography can diagnose ALCAPA in a timely, accurate, and noninvasive manner, and it could be of great significance in guiding clinical operations and in predicting prognosis. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bland White Garland Syndrome#Child#Child, Preschool#Echocardiography#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different nose types on the perception of facial aesthetics following camouflage treatment and orthognathic surgery for skeletal class II female patients.METHODS: A pre-treatment profile photograph of a skeletal class II adult patient was selected from the department archive. Two constructed photographs were created to represent orthognathic surgery and camouflage treatments with the aid of computer software. A total of 18 constructed images was composed using three profiles (pre-treatment, post-camouflage, and post-orthognathic surgery) and six nose types. These photographs were shown to the three groups (orthodontists, plastic surgeons, and lay people), and they were asked to assign an attractiveness score to each photo ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the least attractive and 100 indicating the most attractive.RESULTS: For the convex nose profiles, anterior movement of the mandible obtained by orthognathic surgery did not result in a significant change in the scores given by the lay people. When surgical or camouflage treatment was not implemented and, instead, just rhinoplasty was performed for these profiles, there was a significant increase in the aesthetic scores given by all groups. For the straight nose profiles, orthognathic surgery increased the attractiveness scores given by all groups. Furthermore, for all the profiles, extraction treatment did not affect the aesthetic scores given by any of the groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The lay people perceived that having a convex-bridged nose was a bigger problem than having a retrognathic profile. Overall, in terms of skeletal and dental orthodontic treatments, nose shape should be considered during the treatment planning process. labels: #Adult#Esthetics, Dental#Face#Female#Humans#Nose#Orthognathic Surgery#Orthognathic Surgical Procedures'
b'Objective: To evaluate the concordance of PD-L1 expression in various tissues using antibodies 28-8 and SP263 on their respective detection platforms. Methods: Three hundred seventy four specimens of surgical resection of pulmonary diseases in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2017 were collected. Totally 374 cases were tested for PD-L1 expression using the two antibodies, 28-8 and SP263, by respective detection platforms (Dako and Ventana). Finally, 336 cases were used for further evaluation, and the results were statistically analyzed for concordance. Results: For non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the positive rate of PD-L1 was 57.5% (177/308) using SP263, and 57.5% (177/308) using 28-8 antibody. The correlation coefficient was 0.97 (P<0.01). The positive rate of both benign lung diseases and paracancerous tissues was about 10.7% (3/28), and the positive concordance rate was 100.0%. The distribution of both antibodies was also relatively consistent. Conclusions: The expression levels of 28-8 and SP263 antibodies in NSCLC and other tissues are relatively consistent, suggesting both antibodies may be complementary and substitute for each other, which may be useful in guiding clinical management. labels: #Antibodies#B7-H1 Antigen#Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Lung Neoplasms'
b'Cytoglobin is a heme-containing protein ubiquitous in mammalian tissues. Unlike the evolutionarily related proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin, cytoglobin shows a six-coordinated heme binding, with the heme iron coordinated by two histidine side chains. Cytoglobin is involved in cytoprotection pathways through yet undefined mechanisms, and it has recently been demonstrated that cytoglobin has redox signaling properties via nitric oxide (NO) and nitrite metabolism. The reduced, ferrous cytoglobin can bind oxygen and will react with NO in a dioxygenation reaction to form nitrate, which dampens NO signaling. When deoxygenated, cytoglobin can bind nitrite and reduce it to NO. This oxidoreductase activity could be catalytic if an effective reduction system exists to regenerate the reduced heme species. The nature of the physiological cytoglobin reducing system is unknown, although it has been proposed that ascorbate and cytochrome b5 could fulfill this role. Here we describe that physiological concentrations of cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase can reduce human and fish cytoglobins at rates up to 250-fold higher than those reported for their known physiological substrates, hemoglobin and myoglobin, and up to 100-fold faster than 5 mM ascorbate. These data suggest that the cytochrome b5/cytochrome b5 reductase system is a viable reductant for cytoglobin in vivo, allowing for catalytic oxidoreductase activity. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'A disease outbreak in 42-d-old black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon juveniles from a commercial aquaculture farm in Kerala, India, was investigated. The cause of the disease outbreak was confirmed as Vibrio parahaemolyticus by biochemical tests, PCR targeting the toxR gene and pathogenicity testing of the isolates. All of the isolates tested negative by PCR specific for V. parahaemolyticus associated with acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), implicating vibriosis unrelated to AHPND as the cause of mortality. Among the 19 isolates obtained, 2 possessed the tdh gene (coding for thermo-stable hemolysin), whereas none of the isolates possessed trh. The LD50 value of 8 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus from diseased and apparently healthy shrimp ranged from 2.7 ? 104 to 4.9 ? 105 CFU ml-1 by immersion challenge of P. monodon postlarvae. BOX-PCR and dendrogram analysis of the bacterial isolates revealed that the isolates from moribund and apparently healthy shrimp formed separate clusters, indicating that these isolates originate from separate clones. The isolates from moribund shrimp including tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus clustered together. The present study represents the first report of tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus causing disease in a shrimp farm. labels: #Animals#Aquaculture#India#Penaeidae#Vibrio parahaemolyticus'
b"Many current anti-cancer therapies rely on increasing the intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) contents with the aim to induce irreparable damage, which subsequently results in tumor cell death. A novel tool in cancer therapy is the use of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), which has been found to be very effective in the treatment of many different cancer cell types in vitro as well as in vivo, mainly through the vast generation of RONS. One of the key determinants of the cell's fate will be the interaction of RONS, generated by CAP, with important proteins, i.e. redox-regulatory proteins. One such protein is cytoglobin (CYGB), a recently discovered globin proposed to be involved in the protection of the cell against oxidative stress. In this study, the effect of plasma-produced RONS on CYGB was investigated through the treatment of CYGB with CAP for different treatment times. Spectroscopic analysis of CYGB showed that although chemical modifications occur, its secondary structure remains intact. Mass spectrometry experiments identified these modifications as oxidations of mainly sulfur-containing and aromatic amino acids. With longer treatment time, the treatment was also found to induce nitration of the heme. Furthermore, the two surface-exposed cysteine residues of CYGB were oxidized upon treatment, leading to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges, and potentially also intramolecular disulfide bridges. In addition, molecular dynamics and docking simulations confirmed, and further show, that the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, due to oxidative conditions, affects the CYGB 3D structure, thereby opening the access to the heme group, through gate functioning of His117. Altogether, the results obtained in this study (1) show that plasma-produced RONS can extensively oxidize proteins and (2) that the oxidation status of two redox-active cysteines lead to different conformations of CYGB. labels: #Cytoglobin"
b'Objective: To investigate the alterations of the cerebral resting-state spontaneous neural activity in colorectal cancer patients with depressive symptoms. Methods: Thirty-three colorectal cancer patients (patient group) with depression and 43 healthy subjects (control group) underwent the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were calculated. Two independent samples t test were used to compare the ALFF and fALFF values between two groups by DPABI software, and then correlation analysis was performed between ALFF and fALFF with statistical significance and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scores. Results: Compared with the control group, the patient group showed significantly lower ALFF and fALFF values in the bilateral precuneus, calcarine gyrus, lingual gyrus, left cuneus, superior, middle, inferior occipital gyrus and right fusiform gyrus (t=-5.730, P<0.05; t=-4.872, P<0.05). There were no significant correlations between the ALFF and fALFF values in these regions and PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores (P>0.05). Conclusion: Spontaneous decrease of neural activity in occipital and parietal lobes exists in colorectal cancer patients with depression at resting-sate, which may be a potential neurobiological marker. labels: #Biomarkers#Brain#Case-Control Studies#Colorectal Neoplasms#Depression#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging'
b'Strongyloidiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis whose treatment is particularly difficult in immunosuppressed patients due to their low responsiveness to conventional therapy. Carica papaya and its isolated compounds benzyl isothiocyanate, carpaine and carpasemine are promising compound for the treatment of Strongyloides infections due to their anthelmintic action. This study aims to examine the in vitro ovicidal and larvicidal activity of C. papaya seed hexane extract against Strongyloides venezuelensis, using egg hatching tests and larval motility tests as efficiency markers. The crude extract at the concentrations of 566 - 0.0566 mg/mL or the control with albendazole (0.025 mg/mL) and negative controls (water and PBS) were incubated with an equal volume of egg suspension (\\xc2\\xb1 50 specimens) followed by counting of the specimens after 48 h. The same extract and dilutions were added to L3 larvae suspensions (\\xc2\\xb150 specimens) followed by analysis of larvae viability after 24, 48, and 72 h. The extract inhibited egg hatching with high efficiency at concentrations of 56.6 mg/mL (95.74%) and 5.66 mg/mL (92.16%). At the concentrations of 566 mg/mL (100%) and 56.66 mg/mL (97.32%), the extract inhibited larval motility as effectively as ivermectin (0.316 mg/mL; 100%), and more effectively than the other dilutions and the negative controls. The larvicidal effect depended on the extract concentration, but not on the treatment period. Therefore, C. papaya seed hexane extract has anthelmintic potential against S. venezuelensis and is a promising compound for the development of phytotherapies to treat strongyloidiasis. labels: #Animals#Carica#Larva#Ovum#Parasitic Sensitivity Tests#Plant Extracts#Seeds#Strongyloides'
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) was identified in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and pericytes of all organs; however, the effects of Cygb on cellular functions remain unclear. Here, we report spontaneous and age-dependent malformations in multiple organs of Cygb(-/-) mice. Twenty-six percent of young Cygb(-/-) mice (<1 year old) showed heart hypertrophy, cystic disease in the kidney or ovary, loss of balance, liver fibrosis and lymphoma. Furthermore, 71.3% (82/115) of aged Cygb(-/-) mice (1-2 years old) exhibited abnormalities, such as heart hypertrophy and cancer development in multiple organs; by contrast, 5.8% (4/68) of aged wild-type (WT) mice had abnormalities (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.0001). Interestingly, serum and urine analysis demonstrated that the concentration of nitric oxide metabolites increased significantly in Cygb(-/-) mice, resulting in an imbalance in the oxidative stress and antioxidant defence system that was reversed by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine treatment. A senescent phenotype and evidence of DNA damage were found in primary HSCs and the liver of aged Cygb(-/-) mice. Moreover, compared with HSC(+/+), HSC(-/-) showed high expression of Il-6 and chemokine mRNA when cocultured with mouse Hepa 1-6 cells. Thus, the absence of Cygb in pericytes provokes organ abnormalities, possibly via derangement of the nitric oxide and antioxidant defence system and through accelerated cellular senescence. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: The role of hemoglobin and myoglobin in the cardiovascular system is well established, yet other globins in this context are poorly characterized. Here, we examined the expression and function of cytoglobin (CYGB) during vascular injury.APPROACH AND RESULTS: We characterized CYGB content in intact vessels and primary vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and used 2 different vascular injury models to examine the functional significance of CYGB in vivo. We found that CYGB was strongly expressed in medial arterial VSM and human veins. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that CYGB was lost after VSM cell dedifferentiation. In the rat balloon angioplasty model, site-targeted delivery of adenovirus encoding shRNA specific for CYGB prevented its reexpression and decreased neointima formation. Similarly, 4 weeks after complete ligation of the left common carotid, Cygb knockout mice displayed little to no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia in contrast to their wild-type littermates. Mechanistic studies in the rat indicated that this was primarily associated with increased medial cell loss, terminal uridine nick-end labeling staining, and caspase-3 activation, all indicative of prolonged apoptosis. In vitro, CYGB could be reexpressed after VSM stimulation with cytokines and hypoxia and loss of CYGB sensitized human and rat aortic VSM cells to apoptosis. This was reversed after antioxidant treatment or NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2) inhibition.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CYGB is expressed in vessels primarily in differentiated medial VSM cells where it regulates neointima formation and inhibits apoptosis after injury. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"Objective: To explore the clinical efficacy of lobulated transplantation of free anterolateral thigh perforator flap in repairing electric burn wounds of limbs. Methods: From August 2014 to April 2019, 19 patients with electric burns in the limbs were hospitalized in our unit, including 18 males and 1 female, aged 20-58 years. There were 37 wounds deep to bone. The area of wounds ranged from 3.0 cm?2.0 cm to 40.0 cm?8.0 cm. Multiple-perforator-based anterolateral thigh flap was designed and resected. Then the flap was lobulated taking the respective perforators of the lateral circumflex femoral artery as the axial vessels before being transplanted to the debrided wounds in the limbs. The blood vessel trunk or the perforator vessels of flap lobes were anastomosed with the respective vessels in the recipient sites. The wounds were repaired with respective lobes of the flap when repairing multiple wounds in one surgical procedure, whereas the lobes were spliced or staggered to cover the wound to fit the shape of wound when repairing a single irregular wound in one surgical procedure. For the limb with distal blood supply disorder, the blood supply branch of flap was used to reconstruct the blood supply. If necessary, an appropriate length of vein was taken for transplantation. The improvement of reconstructed blood supply was observed. The number of surgeries, the number of anterolateral thigh perforator flaps, the number and size of flap lobes, the number of anastomosed vessels in each surgery, the treatment of the donor sites, the length of each surgery, the postoperative complications and survival condition of flap lobes were recorded. The upper extremity function was evaluated with the Carroll's Upper Extremity Function Test Scale, and the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery was investigated with a 5-point Likert Scale during follow-up. Surgeries were divided into single wound group of repairing one wound at one time and multiple wounds group of repairing two or more wounds at one time. The number of anastomosed vessels in each surgery, the treatment of the donor sites, the length of each surgery, and the postoperative survival condition of the flap lobes were compared between the two groups. Surgeries were divided into early group of performing surgery within post burn day 7 and late group of performing surgery on post burn day 7 and beyond. The postoperative complications and survival condition of flap lobes, the evaluation score of upper limb function and the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery at the last follow-up were compared between the two groups. Data were processed with independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: The blood supply of 5 patients with distal hand or finger blood supply disorder recovered or improved significantly after vascular transplantation. A total of 46 lobes [(2.2\\xc2\\xb10.4) lobes per flap] were obtained from 21 anterolateral thigh perforator flaps in 19 patients with 21 surgeries. The area of flap lobes ranged from 4.0 cm?3.0 cm to 24.0 cm?13.0 cm. In each surgery, 2.0 (1.5, 3.0) arteries and 3.0 (2.0, 3.0) veins were anastomosed. Six donor sites were repaired by thin split-thickness scalp, and 15 donor sites were closed directly. The duration of each surgery was (8.9\\xc2\\xb11.7) h. After surgery, bleeding and hematoma occurred in 2 flap lobes and local infection occurred in 5 flap lobes, which were improved after management. Vascular crisis occurred in 4 flap lobes, and exploratory surgeries were performed, after which 2 lobes survived, while the other 2 lobes necrotized and were repaired by other methods. The rest flap lobes survived well. After each postoperative follow-up of 3 to 60 months, the flap covering areas of the limbs were well-recovered. At the last follow-up, the function evaluation score of 20 affected upper limbs was 85 (63, 90) points, and the score of patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery was (4.4\\xc2\\xb10.7) points. A total of 30 flap lobes were obtained in 14 surgeries and repaired 30 wounds respectively in multiple wounds group, and 16 flap lobes were obtained in 7 surgeries and were spliced to repair 7 large irregular wounds in single wound group. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of anastomosed artery or vein in each surgery, and the duration of each surgery between multiple wounds group and single wound group (Z=0.240, 0.081, t=0.180, P>0.05), and the condition of skin grafting in the donor sites and the postoperative survival of the flap lobes in multiple wounds group were similar to those in single wound group (P>0.05). A total of 22 flap lobes were obtained in 10 surgeries and repaired 18 wounds in early group, and 24 flap lobes were obtained in 11 surgeries and repaired 19 wounds in late group. The incidence of postoperative hematoma, infection, vascular crisis, and survival of flap lobes in early group were similar to those in late group (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery at the last follow-up between early group and late group (t=0.701, P>0.05). At the last follow-up, the function evaluation score of 9 upper limbs in early group was 90 (85, 97) points, significantly higher than 80 (40, 85) points of 11 upper limbs in late group (Z=2.431, P<0.05). Conclusions: Free lobulated anterolateral thigh perforator flap is suitable for simultaneous repair of multiple electric burn wounds of limbs, as well as the repair of a single large irregular wound. It has the clinical advantages of less damage to the donor site and good repair quality. The early flap transplantation is beneficial to improve the function of limbs with electric burns. labels: #Adult#Burns, Electric#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Perforator Flap#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Thigh#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult"
b'RATIONALE: One-and-a-half syndrome (OAAH) is characterized as the combination of ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. OAAH syndrome accompanied with 7th and 8th cranial nerve palsy is called 16-and-a-half syndrome. We aimed to report the case of 16-and-a-half syndrome with metastatic pons tumor.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old male diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis occurring 15 months ago was referred to our clinic with the chief complaint of horizontal diplopia and right gaze palsy.DIAGNOSIS: According to the patient symptom, ocular examination, and radiographic findings, he was diagnosed as 16-and-a-half syndrome which was caused by brain tumor metastasis from NSCLC.INTERVENTIONS: We referred him to hemato-oncology department and he was treated with radiation and supportive therapy.OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the patient passed away 1 month later without improvement of ophthalmoplegia.LESSONS: The clinical findings of our case indicate 16-and-a-half syndrome caused by brain tumor metastasis from NSCLC, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. The case highlights a rare cause of OAAH spectrum disease and the importance of a systemic work-up including associated neurologic symptoms and brain imaging in patients with horizontal gaze palsy. labels: #Brain Neoplasms#Facial Nerve Diseases#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Ocular Motility Disorders#Ophthalmoplegia#Pons#Syndrome#Vestibulocochlear Nerve Diseases'
b'RATIONALE: Vaginal stone is a rare condition that is often misdiagnosed due to its low incidence. It can be divided into 2 types, primary vaginal and secondary vaginal, based on the etiology of the disease. Vaginal stones involve pathologic calcification. The formation of vaginal stones is mainly due to stasis and urine infection. We describe a procedure for the safe extraction of vaginal stones.PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 25-year-old female patient with congenital genitourinary malformation and urethrovaginal fistula. A urogenital tract malformation repair operation was performed before she was 21 years old. Frequency of urination occurred before and after menstruation for 9 years, and dyspareunia occurred for 1 year.DIAGNOSES: B ultrasound examination showed a 59\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a55\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a23\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm fusiform region of increased signal intensity in the vagina followed by a sound shadow. We performed a gynecologic examination and found that the long diameter of the vaginal opening was 20\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm. A brown substance observed in her vagina had a hard texture and felt like a stone, and a palpation hand test revealed the size was approximately 60\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a50\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm. A cystoscope was inserted into the urethra and revealed that the broken end of the urethra was connected to the vagina. The proximal broken end of the urethra was 20\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm from the distal end.INTERVENTIONS: The purpose of this operation was to make a definite diagnosis and remove the stones. We performed vaginal stone removal surgery and cystoscopy under anesthesia.OUTCOMES: We removed the stone successfully. The patient was discharged from the hospital after a smooth recovery without any complications. Follow-up was conducted 1 month after the operation and then every 3 months.LESSONS: Although vaginal stones are rare, we must pay attention to this disease, especially in patients with congenital genitourinary malformations and urethrovaginal or vesicovaginal fistulas. Obstruction of urine discharge combined with repeated urinary tract infection is the main cause of vaginal stone formation. For these patients, follow-up every 3 months, including a physical examination, B-mode ultrasonography of the urinary system and cystoscopy if necessary, can avoid the occurrence of the disease. labels: #Adult#Calculi#Female#Humans#Urethral Diseases#Urinary Fistula#Vaginal Diseases#Vaginal Fistula'
b'Objective: To investigate the prognostic values of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) calculated from pretreatment (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET-CT results of patients with advanced extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Methods: The clinic data, follow-up data and pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET-CT data of 45 patients with ENKTL of stage ? were collected. The optimal cutoff value of progression-free survival (PFS) of SUV(max), MTV and TLG were analyzed by using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Kaplan-Meier method, Log-rank test and COX proportional hazards model were used for survival analysis, univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, respectively. Results: The median SUV(max), MTV and TLG of 45 ENKTL patients were 17.98, 70.18 and 755.42, respectively. ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SUV(max), MTV and TLG were 0.504 (P=0.970), 0.868 (P<0.001) and 0.848 (P=0.001), respectively. The value of SUV(max) was too small to fit for calculating the cutoff value of AUC. The cutoff value of MTV was 42.54 (sensitivity =78.1% and specificity =84.6%), and the cutoff value of TLG was 435.15 (sensitivity=75.0% and specificity =76.9%). Univariate analysis showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, epstein-barr virus (EBV)-DNA, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, bone marrow, Korean prognostic index (KPI), MTV, TLG were significantly related with PFS (all P<0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, EBV-DNA, ECOG score, primary tumor location, KPI, MTV, TLG were significantly related with overall survival (OS) (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that KPI, MTV and TLG were independent prognostic predictors of PFS and OS (all P<0.05). Conclusions: MTV and TLG of pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET-CT are independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS of patients with advanced ENKTL. MTV and TLG may be more fit for evaluating the prognosis of ENKTL patients than SUV(max). labels: #Fluorodeoxyglucose F18#Glycolysis#Humans#Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell#Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography#Positron-Emission Tomography#Prognosis#Progression-Free Survival#Radiopharmaceuticals#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Tumor Burden'
b'The side stream cigarette smoke (SSCS) is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-induced toxicity. Hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin (Mb), neuroglobin (Ngb), and cytoglobin (Cygb) are globins with different distributions and functions in the tissues and have similar actions by providing O2 (oxygen) for respiratory chain, detoxification of ROS and nitric oxide (NO), and protect tissues against irreversible lesions. We aimed to investigate the effects of SSCS exposure on gene and protein expression of Ngb, Cygb, and Mb in different tissue. The Ngb and Cygb gene and protein expression in the cerebral cortex increased after 1 week of rat exposure to SSCS. In hippocampus, the Ngb gene and protein expression increased after 1 week or more of exposure and no change was observed in Cygb gene and protein expression. In myocardium, Mb and Cygb gene expression increased at 1 and 4 weeks of exposure, while protein expression of both increased at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. In lung, observed an increase in Cygb gene and protein expression after 2, 3, and 4 weeks of exposure. The findings suggest that SSCS modulates Ngb, Cygb, and Mb in central and peripheral tissue \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 32: 1252-1261, 2017. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To investigate the therapeutic strategy in patients with early gastric cancer after noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Methods: A total of 107 cases with early gastric cancer receiving noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection were collected and the patients were classified into an additional gastrectomy group (n=41) and a simple follow-up group (n=66) according to the therapeutic method used after noncurative ESD. The clinicopathological information, short- and long-term clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The mean age of the patients in the gastrectomy group and follow-up group was(59.2\\xc2\\xb18.7)years old and(64.7\\xc2\\xb18.8)years old, respectively. The depth of submucosal invasion was (1445.83\\xc2\\xb1803.12) and (794.71\\xc2\\xb1815.79) \\xc3\\xacm, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.020 for age and P=0.010 for depth of submucosal invasion). Compared with follow-up group, the patients with undifferentiated histologic type, deep invasion of submucosa (SM2), diffuse type, lymphovascular invasion and neural invasion were more common in the gastrectomy group (P<0.05). The R0 resection rate of ESD in the gastrectomy group was significantly lower than the follow-up group(26.8% vs 65.2%, P<0.001). The positive residual tumor rate and LNM rate of additional gastrectomy group were 31.7%(13/41)and 9.76%(4/41)according to the pathological results after gastrectomy. The gastrectomy group had 2 cases of local recurrence (2/41, 4.9%), while 5(5/66, 7.6%)in the follow-up group(4.9% vs 7.6%, P=0.883). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the two study groups (P=0.066 and 0.938, respectively). Conclusions: Assessment of LNM risk should be performed in patients with noncurative endoscopic resection. For patients with low risk of LNM who are intolerance of additional gastrectomy due to old age and comorbidities, close follow-up with endoscopy can be considered as an alternative. labels: #Aged#Disease-Free Survival#Endoscopic Mucosal Resection#Gastrectomy#Humans#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Retrospective Studies#Stomach Neoplasms#Survival Rate#Treatment Outcome'
b'We characterized the peroxidase mechanism of recombinant rat brain cytoglobin (Cygb) challenged by hydrogen peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide and by cumene hydroperoxide. The peroxidase mechanism of Cygb is similar to that of myoglobin. Cygb challenged by hydrogen peroxide is converted to a Fe4+ oxoferryl \\xc3\\xb0 cation, which is converted to Fe4+ oxoferryl and tyrosyl radical detected by direct continuous wave-electron paramagnetic resonance and by 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzene sulfonate spin trapping. When organic peroxides are used as substrates at initial reaction times, and given an excess of peroxide present, the EPR signals of the corresponding peroxyl radicals precede those of the direct tyrosyl radical. This result is consistent with the use of peroxide as a reducing agent for the recycling of Cygb high-valence species. Furthermore, we found that the Cygb oxidation by peroxides leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. This result suggests that Cygb possibly participates in the development of degenerative diseases; our findings also support the possible biological role of Cygb related to peroxidase activity.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Because of the complex injury mechanism, hidden tissue injury, and severe systemic injury, the clinical diagnosis and treatment of electric burn still face many challenges, and the mortality and disability rate are still high. In view of the particularity of electric burn and the prognosis of electric burn, especially the quality of wound repair, the author puts forward some personal views on fluid resuscitation, organ protection, and wound repair on the basis of summarizing the new methods of diagnosis and treatment of electric burn at home and abroad at present, and preliminarily explores the standardized diagnosis and treatment of electric burn. labels: #Burns, Electric#Fluid Therapy#Humans#Prognosis#Wound Healing'
b'We aimed to investigate the correlation of homocysteine (Hcy) level with clinical characteristics, and explore its predictive value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk in female patients with premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS).The serum Hcy level was detected from 1299 female patients with premature ACS. According to the tertile of Hcy level, patients were divided into 3 groups: lowest tertile group (?9.1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L), middle tertile group (9.2-11.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L) and highest tertile group (>11.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L). MACE incidence was recorded and MACE-free survival was caculated with the median follow-up duration of 28.3 months.Increased Hcy correlated with older age (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), higher creatinine level (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), and enhanced uric acid level (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), while reduced fasting glucose concentration (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). MACE incidence was 10.7% and it was highest in highest tertile group (22.1%), followed by middle tertile group (7.7%) and lowest tertile group (2.4%) (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that Hcy distinguished MACE patients from non-MACE patients with the area under the curve of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.742-0.835). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that MACE-free survival was shortest in Hcy highest tertile group, followed by middle tertile group and lowest tertile group (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Multivariate Cox analyses further showed that higher Hcy level was an independent predictive factor for poor MACE-free survival (middle tertile vs lowest tertile (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001, HR: 3.615, 95% CI: 1.661-7.864); highest tertile vs lowest tertile (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001, HR: 11.023, 95% CI: 5.356-22.684)).Hcy serves as a potential predictive factor for increased MACE risk in female patients with premature ACS. labels: #Acute Coronary Syndrome#Age Factors#Cardiovascular Diseases#Female#Homocysteine#Humans#Incidence#Middle Aged#Predictive Value of Tests#Risk Assessment'
b"With the change of disease spectrum and the progress in the aging of society, chronic wound has gradually become one of the major diseases that threaten human health, and also one of the major economic burdens of family and society. According to the different etiology, the pathogenesis of chronic wound is different, including both systemic factors and local factors. The treatment of chronic wound is a multi-disciplinary integrated treatment process, including internal medicine treatment, surgical treatment, vascular interventional therapy, platelet-rich plasma treatment, and biological therapy, etc. Each treatment regimen has its own indications and pros and cons. To make a treatment regimen, a combination of a variety of options should be chosen according to the patient's wound conditions. The traditional chronic wound treatment mode is multi-disciplinary team (MDT) treatment mode, which requires the participation of surgeons from multiple departments such as intervention department, plastic surgery department, orthopedics department, etc., and it is also the mainstream mode for treating chronic wound in western countries. According to the domestic medical situation and the experience of our department, we put forward the integrated surgical wound treatment (ISWT) mode, that is to integrate multiple surgical techniques of wound treatment. Compared with the traditional MDT treatment mode, to apply the ISWT mode can make a more reasonable treatment plan, improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment, shorten the hospitalization period, and improve the diagnosis and treatment ability of the team. With the increasing incidence of chronic wound, the ISWT mode needs to be further explored and improved, and the team needs more specialized experts to join in. labels: #Humans#Surgical Wound"
b'STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.BACKGROUND: Inferior facetectomies, with the utilization of segmental pedicle screw constructs for corrective fixation, can provide adequate flexibility and post less risk of neural tissue and blood loss. We analyzed outcomes of surgical treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) using inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs. We hypothesized that adequate main curve correction and suitable surgical outcomes would be observed using this technique.METHODS: We reviewed 38 AIS patients who underwent inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs by 2 surgeons at a single institution between May 2014 and December 2016. Coronal and sagittal radiographic measurements were evaluated over 1-year follow-up by 2 trained observers not associated with the surgeries. Surgical details, complications, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were also recorded.RESULTS: Mean fusion levels were 11.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.7. The mean Cobb angle of main AIS curves improved from 48.6\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a10.1 degree preoperatively to 11.8\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a6.2 degree postoperatively and 12.4\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a6.2 degree at 1-year follow-up, which percentage correction was 75.9% and 74.6%, respectively. The mean thoracic kyphosis (T5-12) angle was 20.7\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a11.6 degree preoperatively, 17.4\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a8.0 degree postoperatively, and 16.8\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a8.4 degree at 1-year follow-up. The mean surgical time, estimated blood loss, and LOS were 232.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a35.7\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes, 475.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a169.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, and 3.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.3 days. Twelve patients received blood transfusion. There were no neurological or wound complications.CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrated adequate correction of main AIS curves, acceptable thoracic kyphosis and blood loss, and short surgical time and LOS in AIS patients treated with inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs, potentially indicating that inferior facetectomies are adequate and suitable for AIS surgery when segmental pedicle screw constructs are utilized. labels: #Adolescent#Female#Humans#Male#Orthopedic Procedures#Pedicle Screws#Retrospective Studies#Scoliosis#Spine#Treatment Outcome'
b"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of different courses of electroacupuncture treatment on the compliance and therapeutic outcome of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis.METHODS: A total of 60 patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis were randomly divided into 5-time treatment group and 10-time treatment group, with 30 patients in each group. With the same electroacupuncture prescription, the patients in the 5-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 5 times in total, and those in the 10-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 10 times in total, with an interval of 2 days between every 5 times of treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of cervical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis before and after treatment, as well as whether and why the patients were willing to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment. The two groups were followed up to observe the recurrence of cervical spondylosis within 12 months.RESULTS: Both groups had significant improvements in cervical VAS score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis after treatment (P<0.05), and there were no significant differences in these scores between the two groups after treatment (P>0.05). There was also no significant difference in long-term recurrence between the two groups (P>0.05). Of the 30 patients in the 10-time treatment group, 21 (70%) showed no willingness to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment since they were satisfied with their treatment outcomes.CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can effectively improve the pain symptom of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis, and compared with 5 times of electroacupuncture treatment, 10 times of electroacupuncture treatment may affect patients' compliance with clinical treatment. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Electroacupuncture#Humans#Spondylosis#Treatment Outcome"
b'The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on Neuroglobin (Ngb) and Cytoglobin (Cygb) as well as oxidative stress gene expression in the cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control and two groups receiving 2 different daily BPA dosages, 5 or 25\\xc2\\xa0mg/kg from postnatal day 50 (PND50) through PND90 and they were euthanized at PND105. In the cortex, we found an increase in Ngb gene expression and also in superoxide dismutase 1 and Catalase (Cat). In the cerebellum, we found an increase in Ngb and Cat, in the hypothalamus, there was a decrease in Cygb and an increase in glutathione peroxidase and Cat and in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1\\xc3\\xa1) at the low dosage and a decrease in Hif1\\xc3\\xa1 at the high BPA dosage. Finally, in the hippocampus, we observed a decrease in Ngb and Cygb and an increase in Hif1\\xc3\\xa1. In summary, BPA promotes the modulation of both Ngb and Cygb, but such changes occur by different mechanisms depending on the exposure dose and anatomical area. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To explore the screening efficiency of colorectal cancer in urban residents of Kunming, China. Methods: Using the method of cluster sampling, from October 2014 to October 2017, residents of the three jurisdictions of Xishan, Guandu and Chenggong Districts of Kunming city were investigated. The inclusion criteria: (1) resident (for more than 3 years) population of Kunming city aged 40-74 years old; (2) voluntarily participating and receiving colonoscopy; (3) signing informed consent. Based on the Harvard Cancer Risk Index, the questionnaire was built on the consensus of more than 20 years of common cancer epidemiology in China. Through the consensus reached by the multidisciplinary expert panel discussion, a comprehensive evaluation system for cancer risk in China was designed. The high-risk group of colorectal cancer was determined by preliminary screening of the questionnaire, and a free colonoscopy was performed for the appointment to the gastrointestinal endoscopy department of the Yunnan Cancer Hospital. All polypoid lesions and ulcers found by colonoscopy must be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. \\xc3\\xb7(2) test or Fisher exact probability method was used to compare the detection of colorectal cancer in 4 groups of 40-49 years old, 50-59 years old, 60-69 years old, and ?70-years old. Detection of colonoscopy, compliance, pathological examination, pathological diagnosis, and morbidity of colorectal cancer were analyzed. Results: A total of 127 960 people from 40 to 74 years old of urban residents in Kunming city participated in the preliminary screening of the questionnaire, including 59 748 (46.7%) males and 68 212 females (53.3%) with mean age of (53.6\\xc2\\xb18.6) years old. The 40-49 years old group had the largest number of participants (48 044, 37.5%), followed by the groups of 50-59 years old (42 473, 33.2%), 60-69 years old (34 111, 26.7%), and ?70 years old (3332, 2.6%). Till October 2017, a total of 14 971 people were screened as at high risk of colorectal cancer, with the high-risk detection rate of 11.7%, and the high-risk detection rate of women was significantly higher than that of men [13.4% (9 109/68 212) vs. 9.8% (5 862/59 748), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=386.947, P<0.001]. The highest high-risk detection rate was in the 50-59 years group in both gender [men: 11.1% (2202/19 831), women: 15.3% (3034/22 642)]. A total of 3449 people among the high-risk population received colonoscopy examination. The compliance rate of colonoscopy was 23.0% (3449/14 971), and the male compliance rate was 19.8% (1162/5862), which was significantly lower than that of females [25.1% (2287/9109), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=56.175, P<0.001]. The highest compliance was observed in the 50-59 years group [25.4% (1438/5668)], followed by 40-49 years and 60-69 year group [22.1%(1091/4931) and 22.0%(891/4048), respectively], and the compliance of ?70 years old group was the lowest [9.0% (29/324)]. Colonoscopy examination revealed 606 cases with lesions, the detection rate of lesions was 17.6%, and the male detection rate was significantly higher than that of females [26.9% (313/1162) vs. 12.8% (293/2287), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=106.140, P<0.001]. The detection rate of lesions increased with age [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 10.9% (119/1091), 17.5% (252/1438), 25.0% (223/891) and 41.4% (12/29), respectively, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=79.010, P<0.001]. A total of 584 cases underwent endoscopic excision and pathological diagnosis, and 465 cases (13.5%) of precancerous lesions were detected. The prevalence of precancerous lesions in men was higher than that in women [21.3% (247/1162) vs. 9.5% (218/2287), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=90.801, P<0.001], the precancerous lesion detection rate increased with age [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 8.0% (87/1091), 14.3% (206/1438), 18.1% (161/891) and 37.9% (11/29); \\xc3\\xb7(2)=58.109, P<0.001]. A total of 4 patients with colorectal cancer were detected, including 3 males and 1 female. The detection rate of male colorectal cancer was 258.2/100 000, and the female was 43.7/100 000, whose difference was not statistically significant (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=1.488, P=0.223). There was no significant difference in the detection rate of colorectal cancer among 4 age groups [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 91.7/100 000 (1/1091), 69.5/100 000 (1/1438), 224.5/100 000 (2/891) and 0, respectively, P=0.696].

b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate cytoglobin levels in women with preeclampsia and women with uncomplicated pregnancies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 26 pregnant women complicated with early-onset preeclampsia (EO-PE) and 26 pregnant women complicated with late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PE) were recruited for the study group. Twenty-seven healthy pregnant women selected randomly were included in the control group. The serum CYGB concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Gestational age at delivery and mean birth weight were significantly lower in the preeclampsia groups than in the control group and were found to be the lowest in the EO-PE group (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x89.001). Serum CYGB levels were significantly higher in the EO-PE and LO-PE groups as compared with the control group (9.99 (6.08) ng/ml (EOPE), 10.04 (7.04) ng/ml (LOPE) versus 2.84 (0.82) ng/ml), (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x89.001). However, a significant difference was not found between the EO-PE and LO-PE groups regarding CYGB levels (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x891.000).CONCLUSIONS: Serum CYGB levels were significantly higher in patients with EO-PE and LO-PE as compared to healthy pregnant women. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'This study aims to investigate whether the use of recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCygb) impact on hepatic fibrogenesis caused by CCl4. SD (n\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x89150) rats were randomly divided into three groups of normal, CCl4 model and rhCygb groups. After model establishment, rats in rhCygb groups were administered daily with rhCygb (2\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg/kg, s.c.). Histological lesions were staged according to metavir. Serum parameters including ALT, AST, HA, LN, Col III and Col IV were determined. The liver proteins were separated by 2-DE and identified. As a result, the stage of hepatic damage and liver fibrosis in rhCygb groups were significantly milder than that in CCl4 model groups. Meanwhile, rhCygb dramatically reversed serum levels of ALT and AST, and also markedly decreased the liver fibrosis markers levels of LN, HA, Col III and Col IV. In 2-DE, 33 proteins among three groups with the same changing tendency in normal and rhCygb treated groups compared with CCl4 model group were identified. GO analysis showed that several identified proteins involved in oxidative stress pathway. The study provides new insights and data for administration of rhCygb reversing CCl4-induced liver fibrosis suggesting that rhCygb might be used in the treatment of liver fibrosis.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"This study aims to establish the range of exophthalmometry values (EV) in the adult Hong Kong (HK) Chinese population, its relationship with various anthropometric parameters, and to compare it with the EV in different ethnic groups.About 1485 adult HK Chinese were drawn from a random sample from the community-based FAMILY Cohort. Participants were interviewed, and comprehensive ophthalmological assessments were conducted.

The mean EV were found to be 15.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.8\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm in the right eye, 15.2\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.9\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm in the left eye for men and 14.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.7\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm in the right eye, 14.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.7\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm in the left eye for women. There were no differences in the EV between right and left eyes (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). Men had significantly higher EV than women (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05) and age was found to be negatively correlated to EV (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05).

b'This study clarified the role of Cygb, the fourth globin in mammals originally discovered in rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), in cholestatic liver disease. Bile duct ligation (BDL) augmented inflammatory reactions as revealed by increased infiltrating neutrophils, CD68+-macrophages, and chemokine expression in Cygb-/- mice. In these mice, impairment of bile canalicular indicated by the loss of CD10 expression, down-regulation of bile salt transporters, increased total bile acid, and massive apoptotic and necrotic hepatocytes occurred with the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 3, resulting in reduced animal survival compared to wild-type mice. In Cygb-/- mouse liver, all of NO metabolites and oxidative stress were increased. Treatment with NO inhibitor restrained all above phenotypes and restored CD10 expression in BDL Cygb-/- mice, while administration of NO donor aggravated liver damage in BDL-wild type mice to the same extent of BDL-Cygb-/- mice. N-acetylcysteine administration had a negligible effect in all groups. In mice of BDL for 1-3 weeks, expression of all fibrosis-related markers was significantly increased in Cygb-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. Thus, Cygb deficiency in HSCs enhances hepatocyte damage and inflammation in early phase and fibrosis development in late phase in mice subjected to BDL, presumably via altered NO metabolism. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of "Yinqi Guiyuan" needling in the treatment of primary insomnia.METHODS: A total of 79 primary insomnia outpatients were randomly divided into treatment group (n=40) and control group (n=39). The patients in the control group were given oral Estazolam tablets once a day, for successive 4 weeks. For patients of the treatment group, Zhongwan (CV12), Xiawan (CV10), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), Baihui (GV20), etc., were punctured with filiform needles for 30 min. The treatment was conducted three times per week for 4 successive weeks. The sleep quality (sleeping quality, falling asleep time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, hypnotic and daytime dysfunction, 0 to 21 points) was evaluated by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The severity of insomnia (self-perception, sleep satisfaction, daytime function damage, sensibility change, and concern for sleep problems, 0 to 28 points) was assessed using insomnia severity index (ISI) score. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the PSQI score reduction rate = (pre-treatment PSQI score-post-treatment PSQI score)/pre-treatment PSQI score ?100%.RESULTS: After treatment, the total score of PSQI, ISI and the score of each item were all significantly reduced in the two groups relevant to their own pre-treatment (P<0.05). The total score, and scores of hypnotic and daytime dysfunction were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05). Of the 40 and 39 cases in the treatment and control groups, 5 (12.50%) and 4 (10.25%) were cured, 20 (50.00%) and 18 (46.15%) experienced marked improvement, 12 (30.00%) and 13 (33.33%) were effective, and 3 (7.50%) and 4 (10.25%) ineffective, with the total effective rate being 92.50% and 89.74%, respectively. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the effective rate (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: "Yinqi Guiyuan" needling and Estazolam are comparable in treatment primary insomnia, and the former is superior to the latter in avoiding hypnotic drug use and in improving daytime function. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Acupuncture Therapy#Humans#Sleep#Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders#Treatment Outcome'
b'BACKGROUND: Conjunctival filtering bleb scar formation is the main reason for the failure of glaucoma filtration surgery. Cytoglobin (Cygb) has been reported to play an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, fibrosis and tissue damage repairing. This study aimed to investigate the role of Cygb in anti-scarring during excessive conjunctival wound healing after glaucoma filtration surgery.METHODS: Cygb was overexpressed in human tenon fibroblasts (hTFs) by transfecting hTFs with lentiviral particles encoding pLenti6.2-FLAG-Cygb. Changes in the mRNA and protein levels of fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III, TGF-\\xc3\\xa21, and HIF1\\xc3\\xa1 were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting respectively.RESULTS: After Cygb overexpression, hTFs displayed no significant changes in visual appearance and cell counts compared to controls. Whereas, Cygb overexpression significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin compared with control (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.01). There was also a statistically significant decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 and HIF-1\\xc3\\xa1 in hTFs with overexpressed Cygb compared with control group (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.05).CONCLUSION: Our study provided evidence that overexpression of Cygb decreased the expression levels of fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III, TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 and HIF-1\\xc3\\xa1 in hTFs. Therefore, therapies targeting Cygb expression in hTFs may pave a new way for clinicians to solve the problem of post-glaucoma surgery scarring. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggested the globin family member cytoglobin (CYGB) as a potential tumor suppressor; however, the mechanism by which CYGB suppresses cancer is elusive. We investigated the role and mechanism of CYGB in suppressing breast cancer.METHODS: CYGB expression was examined by reverse transcription PCR, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and open database analysis. Promoter methylation was examined by methylation-specific PCR. Metabolomics and proteomics were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, respectively. The effects and mechanisms of ectopic CYGB expression in breast cancer cells were assessed with molecular biological and cellular approaches in vitro and with a xenograft tumor model in nude mice.RESULTS: CYGB expression was downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, which was associated with promoter methylation. Ectopic CYGB expression suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines MCF7 (p53WT) and MB231 (p53mt) in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo. By proteomics and metabolomics analysis, glucose metabolism was found to be one of the main pathways suppressed by CYGB. The CYGB-expressing cells had lower ATP and compromised glycolysis. Additionally, CYGB suppressed key glucose metabolism factors including GLUT1 and HXK2 in p53-dependent and -independent manners. Restoration of GLUT1 or HXK2 expression attenuated CYGB-mediated proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction.CONCLUSIONS: CYGB is a potential tumor suppressor in breast cancer that is epigenetically suppressed. The results for the first time suggest that CYGB suppresses breast cancer through inhibiting glucose metabolism, which could be exploited for breast cancer prevention and therapy. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Cytoglobin (CYGB), discovered in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), is known to possess a radical scavenger function, but its pathophysiological roles remain unclear. Here, for the first time, we generated a new transgenic (TG) mouse line in which both Cygb and mCherry reporter gene expression were under the control of the native Cygb gene promoter. We demonstrated that the expression of Cygb-mCherry was related to endogenous Cygb in adult tissues by tracing mCherry fluorescence together with DNA, mRNA, and protein analyses. Administration of a single dose (50\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg/kg) of thioacetamide (TAA) in Cygb-TG mice resulted in lower levels of alanine transaminase and oxidative stress than those in WT mice. After 10 weeks of TAA administration, Cygb-TG livers exhibited reduced neutrophil accumulation, cytokine expression and fibrosis but high levels of quiescent HSCs. Primary HSCs isolated from Cygb-TG mice (HSCCygb-TG) exhibited significantly decreased mRNA levels of \\xc3\\xa1-smooth muscle actin (\\xc3\\xa1SMA), collagen 1\\xc3\\xa11, and transforming growth factor \\xc3\\xa2-3 after 4 days in culture relative to WT cells. HSCsCygb-TG were resistant to H2O2-induced \\xc3\\xa1SMA expression. Thus, cell-specific overexpression of Cygb attenuates HSC activation and protects mice against TAA-induced liver fibrosis presumably by maintaining HSC quiescence. Cygb is a potential new target for antifibrotic approaches. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To assess clinical features and treatment outcomes in immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Methods: Sixty-two patients with PCNSL who attended Guangdong General Hospital between January 1998 and January 2012 were included. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival methodology and statistical significance of continuous was assessed via the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The median age of the patient cohort was 56 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.14?1.00. The common presentations were increased intracranial pressure symptoms and neuron damage. Performance status of 54 (54/62, 87.1%) patients were the international prognostic index (IPI) 0-2. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (57/62, 91.9%) was most common, and the rest were T-cell lymphoma (4/62,6.4%) and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (1/62, 1.6%). In the series, 32 patients (32/62, 51.6%) had multiple lesions. Involvement of deep structures was found in 30 (30/62, 48.4%) patients. An elevated serum LDH level was detected in 19 (19/62, 30.6%) patients and the Ki-67 index was ?90% in 38 (38/62, 61.3%) patients. Univariate analysis showed patients who were female, age<60 years, had WHO Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status grade 0-2, single lesion, absence of deep structures involvement and normal LDH level showed better 2-year survival rate and longer median survival time. Significance was only seen in the normal LDH level group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that radical surgery only and Rituximab+ high-dose of methotrexate+ whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) were independent prognostic indicators in PCNSL patients (P<0.05). Conclusions: PCNSL is a rare but aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Patients treated with high-dose of methotrexate combining with rituximab, followed by WBRT have a better prognosis and longer survival time, and thus these could probably be a promising treatment. labels: #Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Central Nervous System Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse#Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b"Cytoglobin (CYGB) belongs to the mammalian globin family and is exclusively expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the liver. In addition to its gas-binding ability, CYGB is relevant to hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer because of its anti-oxidative properties; however, the regulation of CYGB gene expression remains unknown. Here, we sought to identify factors that induce CYGB expression in HSCs and to clarify the molecular mechanism involved. We used the human HSC cell line HHSteC and primary human HSCs isolated from intact human liver tissues. In HHSteC cells, treatment with a culture supplement solution that included fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) increased CYGB expression with concomitant and time-dependent \\xc3\\xa1-smooth muscle actin (\\xc3\\xa1SMA) down-regulation. We found that FGF2 is a key factor in inducing the alteration in both CYGB and \\xc3\\xa1SMA expression in HHSteCs and primary HSCs and that FGF2 triggered the rapid phosphorylation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-JUN. Both the JNK inhibitor PS600125 and transfection of c-JUN-targeting siRNA abrogated FGF2-mediated CYGB induction, and conversely, c-JUN overexpression induced CYGB and reduced \\xc3\\xa1SMA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that upon FGF2 stimulation, phospho-c-JUN bound to its consensus motif (5'-TGA(C/G)TCA), located -218 to -222 bases from the transcription initiation site in the CYGB promoter. Of note, in bile duct-ligated mice, FGF2 administration ameliorated liver fibrosis and significantly reduced HSC activation. In conclusion, FGF2 triggers CYGB gene expression and deactivation of myofibroblastic human HSCs, indicating that FGF2 has therapeutic potential for managing liver fibrosis. labels: #Cytoglobin"
b'Objective: To observe the clinical application effect of blood circulation enhancement technique in repairing large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities with super large free anterolateral thigh flap. Methods: From March 2014 to March 2017, 6 patients with large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities were hospitalized in our unit, including 5 males and 1 female, aged 27-65 years, 1 case of electric injury, 2 cases of coal burn, 3 cases of traffic injury, 2 cases involving upper limb, and 4 cases involving lower limb. After debridement, the wound area ranged from 26 cm?8 cm to 36 cm?15 cm, and the bone exposure area ranged from 24 cm?7 cm to 35 cm?14 cm. The blood circulation enhancement technique was used when the wound with bone exposure was repaired with super large free anterolateral thigh flap. The area of flaps ranged from 28 cm?10 cm to 38 cm?16 cm. The donor site of flap and the primary wound without bone exposure were repaired with medial thigh split-thickness skin graft of the donor leg of flap. The blood circulation enhancement technique mode during operation and the survival of flaps after operation were recorded, and the recovery of donor and recipient areas and the occurrence of complications were followed up. Results: Three patients were treated with simple vascular supercharging technique during flap transplantation, and the other 3 patients were treated with vascular supercharging and turbocharging technique during flap transplantation. All the flaps survived well in 6 patients without vascular crisis. Follow-up for 3 to 12 months after surgery showed that the blood flow of the flaps was good and the depth and superficial sensation recovered to varying degrees. Except for 1 case of upper limb flap, the other flaps had no obvious swelling and needed no second thinning. There were only depressed scars in the donor sites, and no obvious scar hyperplasia in the area without bone exposure repaired by the skin grafts. No short-term or long-term complications were found. Conclusions: The application of blood circulation enhancement technique in repairing large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities with super large free anterolateral thigh flaps provides reliable blood supply for the flaps and results in good effect after operation, which is worth popularizing. labels: #Adult#Aged#Female#Free Tissue Flaps#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Thigh#Treatment Outcome'
b'Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential and crucial for brain development, playing a role in growth and differentiation. Two globins named neuroglobin (Ngb) and cytoglobin (Cygb) are located in the brain, and each one has different distribution and function: They seem to have similar action by providing O(2) for respiratory chain, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) protecting tissues against irreversible lesions. We aimed to investigate the influence of thyroid state in Ngb and Cygb metabolism in different brain regions and evaluate their responses in cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex (hereafter called as cortex) after supraphysiological doses at different time points of TH administration. Experiments were carried out in rats, divided in eight experimental groups Control (C), thyroidectomy (Tx), and thyroidectomy treated with jugular intravenous injection (i.v). T3 (100 \\xc3\\xacl/100 g) injection and sacrificed after 30, 60, 120 min and 6, 12 and 24 h. In cortex, we found increase in Ngb gene and protein expression in different time points compared to C group, however Cygb gene and protein expression were decreased. In hippocampus, Ngb and Cygb protein expression increased 24 h after i.v. T3 injection in comparison to Tx. In cerebellum, we found increased Ngb gene expression after 120 min, 6, 12 and 24 h after T3 administration compared to Tx, and in contrast, protein expression was found to be significantly increased only 12 and 24 h compared to Tx. Ngb and Cygb expression in brain is influenced by thyroid hormone state both by its lack or excess. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Recent evidence from humans and rats indicates that nitrite is a vasodilator under hypoxic conditions by reacting with metal-containing proteins to produce nitric oxide (NO). We tested the hypothesis that near-physiological concentrations of nitrite would produce vasodilation in a hypoxia- and concentration-dependent manner in the hind limb of sheep. Anesthetized sheep were instrumented to measure arterial blood pressure and femoral blood flows continuously in both hind limbs. Nitrite was infused into one femoral artery to raise the nitrite concentration in the femoral vein by 10 to 15-fold while the sheep breathed 50%, 14% or 12% oxygen in inspired air. In contrast to reports in humans and rats, the nitrite infusion had no measurable effect on mean femoral blood flows or vascular conductances, regardless of inspired O2 levels. In vitro experiments showed no significant difference in the release of NO from nitrite in sheep and human red blood cells. Further experiments demonstrated nitrite is converted to NO in rat artery homogenates faster than sheep arteries, and that this source of NO production is attenuated in the presence of a heme oxidizer. Finally, western blots indicate that concentrations of the heme-containing protein cytoglobin, but not myoglobin, are markedly lower in sheep arteries compared with rats. Overall, the results demonstrate that nitrite is not a physiological vasodilator in sheep. This is likely due to a lack of conversion of nitrite to NO within the vascular smooth muscle, perhaps due to deficient amounts of the heme-containing protein cytoglobin. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of different courses of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention on recognition memory and the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells in mice with radiation-induced brain injury, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improving radiation-induced brain injury.METHODS: Se-venty 30-day old C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups, and the latter two groups were further divided into 1 week (W), 2 W and 3 W subgroups (n=10 in the control group and each subgroup). The ra-diation-induced brain injury model was established by radiating the mouse\\\' left head at a dose of 8 Gy for 10 min by using a radiation linear accelerator. EA (1.5 V, 2 Hz/10 Hz) was applied to "Baihui" (GV20), "Fengfu" (GV14) and bilateral "Shenshu" (BL23) for 30 min, once daily for 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. The learning-cognition memory ability was detected by using novel object recognition test in an open test box to record the time for exploring a novel object (TN) and a familiar object and to calculate the recognition index (RI). The neural stem cells\\\' proliferation and differentiation in the hippocampus tissues were evaluated by counting the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells, neuronal nuclei (NeuN)/BrdU-positive cells and BrdU/glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells under microscope after immunofluorescence stain.RESULTS: After modeling, the TN at 90 min and 24 h and RI of the model subgroup 3 W at 90 min and RI of the model subgroup 1, 2 and 3 W at 24 h were significantly decreased in comparison with those of the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). Moreover, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the model subgroup 1 W and 2 W, the BrdU/NeuN double-labeled cells in the 3 model subgroups and BrdU/GFAP double-labeled cells in the model subgroup 1 W and 3 W were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05). Following EA interventions, the TN in the 3 EA subgroups at both 90 min and 24 h, and RI of EA subgroup 3 W at 90 min and EA subgroup 2 W and 3 W at 24 h were considerably increased compared with those of the corresponding 3 model subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The numbers of BrdU-positive cells as well as BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP double-labeled cells were significantly increased in the 3 EA subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001).CONCLUSION: EA of GV20, GV14 and BL23 can improve the recognition memory ability of mice with radiation-induced brain injury, which may be related to its effect in promoting the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the hippocampus. labels: #Animals#Brain Injuries#Cell Differentiation#Cell Proliferation#Electroacupuncture#Hippocampus#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Neural Stem Cells'
b'Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is an important worldwide public health issue with no satisfying treatment available since now. Here we explore the effects of recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCygb) on chronic alcohol-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. In vivo studies showed that rhCygb was able to ameliorate alcohol-induced liver injury, significantly reversed increased serum index (ALT, AST, TG, TC and LDL-C) and decreased serum HDL-C. Histopathology observation of the liver of rats treated with rhCygb confirmed the biochemical data. Furthermore, rhCygb significantly inhibited Kupffer cells (KCs) proliferation and TNF-\\xc3\\xa1 expression in LPS-induced KCs. rhCygb also inhibited LPS-induced NADPH oxidase activity and ROS, NO and O2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2- generation. These results collectively indicate that rhCygb exert the protective effect on chronic alcohol-induced liver injury through suppression of KC activation and oxidative stress. In view of its anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory features, rhCygb might be a promising candidate for development as a therapeutic agent against ALD. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of nosocomial infections. This species is characterised by the presence of pandemic lineages (International Clones) that present a broad antimicrobial resistance profile.OBJECTIVE: To perform the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from a clinical setting in the Amazon Basin, and to characterise their antimicrobial resistance determinants.METHODS: The genetic relationship of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Class A, B and D \\xc3\\xa2-lactamase genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile was obtained by Disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination.FINDINGS: All carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains belonged to three international clones, IC-1, IC-5 and IC-6, the latter recently reported by the first time in Brazil. The major determinant of carbapenem resistance in IC-1 and IC-5 strains was bla OXA-23, associated with ISAba1 and ISAba3, respectively, while IC-6 harboured the bla OXA-72.CONCLUSIONS: The A. baumannii epidemiology in Brazilian Amazon Region was unknown. It was demonstrated that A. baumannii XDR international clones were responsible for nosocomial infections in Boa Vista during 2016-2018, revealing that the epidemiological scenario of A. baumannii infections in Amazon Region resembles those from the cosmopolitan regions worldwide. labels: #Acinetobacter Infections#Acinetobacter baumannii#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Brazil#Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field#Genotype#Humans#Multilocus Sequence Typing#Phenotype#beta-Lactamases'
b'Globin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) dioxygenase and nitrite reductase activities have been proposed to serve protective functions within the cell by scavenging or generating NO respectively. Cytoglobin has rapid NO dioxygenase activity, similar to other globins, however, the apparent rates of nitrite reductase activity have been reported as slow or negligible. Here we report that the activity of cytoglobin nitrite reductase activity is strongly dependent on the oxidation state of the two surface-exposed cysteine residues. The formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between cysteines C38 and C83 enhances the nitrite reductase activity by 50-fold over that of the monomer with free sulfhydryl or 140-fold over that of the dimer with intermolecular disulfide bonds. The NO dioxygenase reactivity of cytoglobin is very rapid with or without disulfide bond, however, binding of the distal histidine following dissociation of the nitrate are affected by the presence or absence of the disulfide bond. The nitrite reductase activity reported here for the monomer with intramolecular disulfide is much higher than of those previously reported for other mammalian globins, suggesting a plausible role for this biochemistry in controlling NO homeostasis the cell under oxidative and ischemic conditions. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on behavioral changes, and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \\xc3\\xa1-synuclein(\\xc3\\xa1-syn), transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6) and transcription factor X box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) in the substantia nigra of Parkinson\\\'s disease (PD) rats, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of motor function.METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups (n=12 rats in each group). The PD model was established by subcutaneous injection of rotenone (2 mg/kg) at the neck and back, once a day for 28 days. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Fengfu" (GV16) and bilateral "Taichong" (LR3) for 20 min, once a day for 14 successive days. The voluntary motor behavioral changes (total distance, average speed, total movement time, total rest time in 8 min) were detected by open field tests. The immuno-activity of TH and \\xc3\\xa1-syn in the substantia nigra was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA detected by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR.RESULTS: Following modeling and compared with the control group, the total distance, average speed and total movement time of voluntary movement were significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the total rest time was significantly increased (P<0.01). Moreover, the expression of TH was significantly decreased (P<0.01), and that of \\xc3\\xa1-syn protein, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA significantly increased in the model group in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). After the intervention, the total distance, average speed, and total movement time of voluntary movement in the EA group were considerably higher than those in the model group (P<0.01), and the total rest time was obviously decreased in the EA group (P<0.01). The expression level of TH was significantly increased (P<0.01), and those of \\xc3\\xa1-syn, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA were notably decreased in the EA group compared with the model group (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: EA intervention can improve the locomotor function in PD model rats, which is associated with its functions in up-regulating the expression of TH protein and down-regulating the expression of \\xc3\\xa1-syn protein, and ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA in the substantia nigra of mesencephalon. labels: #Activating Transcription Factor 6#Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Parkinson Disease#RNA, Messenger#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Substantia Nigra#Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase#X-Box Binding Protein 1#alpha-Synuclein'
b"Objective: To analyze clinical characteristics and wound repair methods and effects of patients with upper limb electric burns. Methods: Medical records of 136 patients with upper limb electric burn who met the inclusion criteria and hospitalized in our unit from January 2015 to March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Proportion in patients with electric burns in the same period, gender, age, admission time, categories, injury causes, injury voltage, burn area and depth of upper limb, simultaneous injury of both upper limbs, and early wound treatment measure of patients with upper limb electric burn were recorded. The main repair methods of each affected limb were classified and recorded. The overall efficacy of the patients was recorded, including postoperative wound complications and healing condition. The patients repaired with distal pedicled flaps and those with free flaps were followed up for 3 to 6 months. The survival rate of flaps were recorded, the function of affected limbs after operation was evaluated, and the satisfaction degree of patients was investigated by Curative Effect Score Table. The amputation rate, age, and burn area of upper limbs of patients caused by high-voltage and low-voltage electricity were compared. Data were processed with Wilcoxon rank sum test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: (1) The number of upper limb electric burn patients accounted for 88.3% of 154 patients with electric burns hospitalized in the same period, including 117 males and 19 females, aged 1 year and 2 months to 72 years [(34\\xc2\\xb118) years], admitted 1 h to 48 d after injury, including 51 electricians, 32 rural migrant workers, 31 students and preschool children, and 22 patients belonging to other categories. Patients of the first two categories were mainly injured by work accidents, and those of the latter two categories mainly suffered from touching power source or power leakage. Among all the patients, 75 cases were injured by high-voltage electric burn, and 61 cases were injured by low-voltage electric burn, with burn area of upper limb from 0.2% to 16.0% [2% (1%, 5%)] total body surface area (TBSA) and area of wounds deep to bone from 0.2% to 15.0% [2% (1%, 5%)] TBSA. Two upper limbs in 54 cases were simultaneously injured, accounting for 39.7%. Early fasciotomy was performed for 73 limbs. (2) Thirteen affected limbs were treated with dressing change, 2 affected limbs were sutured directly after debridement, 56 affected limbs were repaired by skin grafting, 12 affected limbs were repaired by local flap, 45 affected limbs were repaired by distal pedicled flap, 22 affected limbs were repaired by free flap, and 40 affected limbs were amputated (accounting for 21.1%). (3) One case died of pulmonary infection, sepsis, and multiple organ failure after operation, and the rest patients were all cured. One case with avulsion of abdominal flap was repaired by skin grafting after dressing change. The anterolateral thigh flap in one case necrotized after transplantation, which was replaced by pedicled abdominal flap. Seven cases had small erosion on the pedicle or margin after transplantation of abdominal flap and were healed by dressing change. Six cases had local bruising at the distal end after transplantation of abdominal flap and were healed after conservative treatment such as hyperbaric oxygen. The other flaps survived well. (4) The survival rate of distal pedicled flap grafting was 97.8% (44/45), which was close to that of free flap grafting (95.5%, 21/22, P>0.05). The function recovery of affected limb after free flap grafting was better than that of distal pedicled flap grafting (Z=-3.054, P<0.01), but their satisfaction degree of patients was similar (Z=-0.474, P>0.05). (5) Patients with high-voltage electric burn had higher amputation rate, older age, and larger upper limb burn area than those with low-voltage electric burn (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=4.743, Z=-2.801, -6.469, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: Upper extremity electric burn often occurs in children, electricians, and rural migrant workers with high rate of amputation. Teachers and parents should strengthen safety education for children and manage power source of life well. Workers should improve safety awareness and operate standardly. Fasciotomy for relaxation should be performed for electric burn wound as soon as possible, and flap grafting can effectively repair wound after early debridement. The function recovery of affected upper limb repaired with free flap grafting is better. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Burns, Electric#Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Retrospective Studies#Skin Transplantation#Treatment Outcome#Upper Extremity#Wound Healing#Young Adult"
b'Cytoglobin (Cygb) is an emerging tumor suppressor gene silenced by promoter hypermethylation in many human tumors. So far, the precise molecular mechanism underlying its tumor suppressive function remains poorly understood. Here, we identified Cygb as a genotoxic stress-responsive hemoprotein upregulated upon sensing cellular DNA damage. Our studies demonstrated that Cygb physically associates with and stabilizes p53, a key cellular DNA damage signaling factor. We provide evidence that Cygb extends the half-life of p53 by blocking its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. We show that, upon DNA damage, cells overexpressing Cygb displayed proliferation defect by rapid accumulation of p53 and its target gene p21, while Cygb knockdown cells failed to efficiently arrest in G1 phase in response to DNA insult. These results suggest a possible involvement of Cygb in mediating cellular response to DNA damage and thereby contributing in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Our study thus presents a novel insight into the mechanistic role of Cygb in tumor suppression.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupunctur (EA) and moxibustion of left or right "Tian-shu" (ST25) on intragastric pressure (IGP) in normal rats.METHODS: Twenty male SD rats were equally and randomly divided into EA group and moxibustion group. EA (2 Hz/15 Hz, 2 mA) or moxibustion (46-48 ?) was applied to unilate-ral ST25 for 2 min. The IGP was detected by using a pressure-transducer and an amplifier before and after EA or moxibustion.RESULTS: Compared with pre-intervention, the IGP was significantly decreased after EA or moxibustion stimulation of both left and right ST25 (P<0.05). The IGP levels during 0-30 s and 30-60 s of EA stimulation of both left and right ST25 were significantly lower than those of moxibustion (P<0.05). The IGP-lowering effect of EA on the left ST25 was evidently stronger than that of the right ST25 (P<0.05), but without significant difference between the bilateral sides in moxibustion-induced IGP reduction (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: Both EA and moxibustion of ST25 can lower IGP, and the effect of EA is significantly stronger than that of moxibustion in normal rats. In addition, the IGP-lowering effect of EA of the left ST25 is markedly stronger than that of the right ST25, suggesting a lateral advantage effect. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Moxibustion#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the role of extended involved-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with early stage extranodal nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) in a single center, and to explore the long-term effect of risk-adaptive therapy. Methods: Among 238 patients with early stage NKTCL, there were 191 in high-risk group [any risk factor of age > 60, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score?2, primary tumor invasion, or Ann Arbor stage ?] and 47 in low-risk group (no risk factor). A total of 204 patients received radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, 15 received radiotherapy alone and 19 received chemotherapy alone. One-hundred and eighty-six patients had radiotherapy at a dose ?50 Gy and 159 patients received chemotherapy with asparaginase-based regimen. Results: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and progression- free survival (PFS)rate of all patients were 66.2% and 57.5%. Five-year OS and PFS rates in low-risk group were 91.8% and 88.0%, while 59.3% and 49.3% in high-risk group. The survival of patients in low-risk group were better than those in high-risk group (both P<0.001). The five-year OS rate in combined therapy group, radiotherapy group and chemotherapy group were 71.7%, 52.3% and 20.7%, respectively (P<0.001). The five-year PFS rate were 63.5%, 23.3% and 24.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Among 219 patients receiving radiotherapy, the 5-year OS and PFS rate of patients with primary site radiotherapy dose ? 50 Gy were 72.6% and 66.1%, higher than those of patients with a dose <50 Gy (57.3% and 30.9%, respectively; P=0.031, P<0.001). In the high-risk group, the 5-year OS and PFS rate of the patients who received radiotherapy combined with more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy were 66.5% and 62.6%, higher than those of patients received less than 4 cycles of chemotherapy (56.7% and 46.4%, P=0.045 and 0.020, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that ECOG score (HR=2.208, P=0.001), primary site (HR=4.887, P<0.001), primary tumor invasion (HR=3.265, P=0.001) and radiation dose (HR=1.895, P=0.011) were independent factors of OS in early NKTCL patients. Conclusion: Extended-involved field IMRT with radiation dose more than 50 Gy was the main treatment for patients with early stage NKTCL. Radiotherapy combined with adequate cycle chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis of high-risk patients. labels: #Combined Modality Therapy#Disease-Free Survival#Drug Therapy#Humans#Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated#Risk Factors#Survival Rate'
b'Panulirus argus virus 1 (PaV1) affects wild populations of Caribbean spiny lobsters. PaV1 can be lethal but shows predilection for juvenile lobsters. Because P. argus is one of the most valuable fisheries around the wider Caribbean region, monitoring disease prevalence in local populations is desirable. Diseased lobsters are easily recognized by their milky hemolymph, but this sign only becomes evident in advanced stages of infection. Other methods have been developed to detect PaV1, but are less practical for long-term monitoring of patterns of infection in populations. A previous study estimated the validity measures (sensitivity and specificity) of detection of PaV1 infection by observed clinical signs against endpoint PCR assays, using a representative sample of lobsters comprising mainly subadults and adults from a commercial fishing area. In the present study, these validity measures were estimated in a similar manner for a different population comprising mainly juveniles from a protected nursery area. We obtained virtually the same sensitivity and specificity values (0.48 and 1, respectively) for observed clinical signs as in the previous study (0.51 and 1, respectively), confirming the validity of applying a simple 2? correction factor to monitor the patterns of PaV1 infection over time based on more easily conducted visual assessments of a representative sample of the population. labels: #Animals#Fisheries#Hemolymph#Palinuridae#Polymerase Chain Reaction'
b'Internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) metastasis forms the part of the N-staging of breast cancer, and affects the treatment program and prognosis. At present, IMLN metastasis is clinically diagnosed by anatomical imaging, functional imaging and postoperative pathology. Anatomical imaging includes ultrasound, CT and MRI. Functional image includes positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT), PET-MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SPECT-CT. Because of the special location of the internal mammary region and the complex anatomical structure around it, the imaging diagnosis rate and pathological diagnosis rate of IMLN are often different. Therefore, it is important to identify the relevant factors of IMLN metastasis for guiding the local treatment of internal mammary region, including the scope of surgery and radiotherapy. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Humans#Incidence#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Metastasis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Neoplasm Staging#Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography#Risk Factors#Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography'
b'PURPOSE: To compare the 3-year outcomes of immediately loaded and one-stage conventionally loaded variable-thread tapered implants in the posterior maxilla.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a split-mouth randomised controlled trial. Twenty-six patients attending the postgraduate Periodontics Department at the Lebanese University, and missing teeth bilaterally in the posterior maxilla were randomised. All patients received three to four implants in each of the posterior sextants. The implants on one side were immediately loaded with a provisional resin fixed partial denture on definitive multi-unit abutments regardless of their primary stability. The implants in the contralateral side received definitive multi-unit abutments according to the one-stage unloaded protocol. Three to 3.5 months following implant placement, the implants were restored with metal-ceramic fixed prostheses. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis failure rates, complications, and peri-implant bone level changes up to 3 years following delivery of the definitive prosthesis. The clinical outcomes and radiographic measurements were performed by a single outcome assessor blinded to the type of interventions.RESULTS: Two patients dropped out prior to the delivery of definitive prostheses. The results were analysed using a per-protocol analysis and included 24 patients. Four implants supporting a four-unit immediately loaded prosthesis failed in one patient, 3 months following definitive prosthesis. In the same patient, the three contralateral conventionally loaded implants failed 14 months after definitive prosthesis. There were no significant differences in the proportions of implant and prosthesis failures at 3 years (difference = 0%; 95% CI 0.0% to 14.2%; P = 0.999). Peri-implantitis was diagnosed at two adjacent conventionally loaded implants in one patient at the 3-year examination. In the immediately loaded group, four early minor prosthetic complications occurred during the provisionalisation phase. Following delivery of the definitive prostheses, one minor ceramic fracture was observed in each of the implant groups. The difference in the rate of complications between the two interventions was not statistically significant at 3 years (difference = 13%; 95% CI 3.4% to 27.7%; P = 0.453). The 3-year peri-implant marginal bone level changes were evaluated in 23 patients (77 immediately loaded and 76 conventionally loaded implants). On average, patients lost 0.79 (0.62) mm at the immediately loaded and 0.91 (0.82) mm at the conventionally loaded implants, the difference being statistically not significant (difference = 0.12 mm; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.55 mm; P = 0.590). The 3-year marginal bone level changes were not significantly different between smokers (n = 12) and non-smokers (n = 11) (difference = 0.19 mm; 95% CI -0.24 to 0.62 mm; P = 0.382).CONCLUSIONS: Immediate loading of three- to four-unit fixed partial prostheses supported by variable-thread implants in the posterior maxilla can achieve similar 3-year results to one-stage conventionally loaded implants. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Denture, Partial, Fixed#Humans#Immediate Dental Implant Loading#Maxilla'
b'RATIONALE: Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to long-term viral suppression, reduces proviral reservoir size, and prolongs time to rebound. Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lifelong disease, diagnostic monitoring after confirmed infection is typically not performed; therefore, little is known about the impact of early initiation and long-term ART on the sensitivity of assays that detect HIV antibodies and viral nucleic acid in children and adolescents.PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report 1 case of diagnosed and confirmed perinatal HIV-1C infection with longstanding viral suppression, who subsequently had a negative HIV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test, undetectable antibodies to HIV-1, and high CD4+ T cell count after 14 years of ART.DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with HIV in 2002 at 1 and 2 months of age using DNA polymerase chain reaction. At 8 months old, his viral load was 1210 HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL and CD4 T cell count was 3768\\xe2\\x80\\x8acells/mm.INTERVENTION: At the age of 9 months, highly active antiretroviral therapy comprising of zidovudine, nevirapine, and lamivudine was initiated. The patient remained on this treatment for 14 years 11 months and was virally suppressed.OUTCOMES: At the age of 14 years 4 months, the participant decided to visit a local voluntary HIV testing center, where a rapid HIV test came out negative and the viral load was undetectable (<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). These results led to termination of ART which led to viral rebound within 9 months.LESSONS: As more people with early HIV infection initiate early ART in the context of "Test and Treat all" recommendations, aspects of this report may become more commonplace, with both clinical and public health implications. If the possibility of functional cure (or false-positive diagnosis) is being considered, decisions to terminate ART should be made cautiously and with expert guidance, and may benefit from highly sensitive quantification of the proviral reservoir. labels: #Adolescent#Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active#DNA, Viral#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#HIV-1#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Male#Proviruses#Time Factors#Virus Activation#Withholding Treatment'
b'PURPOSE: The purpose of the present systematic review was to investigate at the histological level if a modified titanium surface abutment could affect the behaviour of soft peri-implant tissue (connective tissue adhesion and soft tissue inflammation).MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic databases research (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) until 24 June 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI) was performed. The focused question was: "In healthy patients with at least one titanium healing abutment connected to a dental implant, is the effect of a healing abutment surface modification different from machined titanium at the histological level?" The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess the risk of bias in individual studies was used for RCTs. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used to evaluate NRSI.RESULTS: In total, 192 records were evaluated for titles and abstracts. Seven studies were included in the review. Five of them reported an enhanced soft tissue adhesion in the modified abutment group without increasing the soft tissue inflammation. One study reported no significant differences among titanium-modified (double acid-etched) and titanium-machined groups. One author demonstrated at the 6-month follow-up period a higher level of inflammation around acid-etched surfaces, with a higher number of T and B lymphocytes and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term data (< 6 months) suggested an enhanced connective fibre attachment next to titanium abutments with a modified surface and a similar inflammatory response, in comparison with machined surface titanium abutments. However, modified surfaces may lead to a long-term increased risk of a higher degree of inflammation in the peri-implant tissues. Due to limited available evidence, further long-term studies are needed to confirm these results. labels: #Dental Abutments#Dental Implants#Humans#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Titanium#Tooth#Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A'

b'Objective: To investigate the expression of LC3B, p-AMPK\\xc3\\xa1 and p27 in cortical tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Methods: Nineteen specimens of surgically resected TSC cortical tubers were collected at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, from 2014 to 2017. The expression of the three proteins in the lesions and the adjacent relatively normal regions was detected by immunohistochemical staining (EnVision two-step method). Results: LC3B was mainly expressed in the dysmorphic neuron and giant cell in TSC cortical tubers and in the adjacent relatively normal neurons, and the expression was diffuse or perinuclear cytoplasmic. There was no significant difference in the average optical density between abnormal cells and neurons adjacent to the lesions (0.343\\xc2\\xb10.195 vs. 0.419\\xc2\\xb10.088, P>0.05). p-AMPK\\xc3\\xa1 was localized in the cytoplasm of dysmorphic neurons and giant cell in TSC cortical tubers. The average optical density of abnormal cells in the lesions was significantly higher than that of neurons adjacent to the lesions (0.306\\xc2\\xb10.123 vs. 0.233\\xc2\\xb10.654, P<0.05). P27 showed nuclear positivity, mainly expressed in the neurons and glial cells close to TSC cortical tubers, while the positive rate in the abnormal cells in TSC cortical tubers was low (15/19 vs. 7/19, P<0.05). Conclusion: There is no significant decrease in the level of autophagy in dysmorphic neurons and giant cells in TSC cortical tubers, which may be related to the compensatory mechanism of AMPK signaling pathway, but without activation of downstream p27. labels: #Autophagy-Related Proteins#Cerebral Cortex#Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27#Humans#Microtubule-Associated Proteins#Neuroglia#Neurons#Protein Kinases#Tuberous Sclerosis'

b'We evaluated overall survivals (OSs) of alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without LC compared to those with LC.Between 2005 and 2015, 1343 patients were initially diagnosed as having HCC in our hospital. Of these, 186 alcohol-related HCC patients were enrolled in this study, and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. Significant alcohol intake was defined as more than 210\\xe2\\x80\\x8agrams/week for men and more than 140\\xe2\\x80\\x8agrams/week for women.Non-cirrhotic HCC was observed in 37.1% of the 186 patients. Cumulative OS rates were significantly higher in non-cirrhotic patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006). For the 117 cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class B (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001) or CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001) patients, respectively. In the 69 non-cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class C patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), but, not than in the CTP class B patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.157). Multivariate analyses revealed that CTP class B (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), and tumor size (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006) were significant predictors for OS in cirrhotic patients, and that CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002) and tumor size (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.023) were significant predictors for OS in non-cirrhotic patients.OS was found to be better for non-cirrhotic than cirrhotic patients with alcohol-related HCC. Survivals of alcohol-related HCC patients without cirrhosis were comparable between patients with CTP class A and B. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Female#Humans#Liver Cirrhosis#Liver Diseases, Alcoholic#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors'
b'Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the causative bacterium of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. This bacterium secretes protein toxins whose genes are encoded in an auto-transmissible plasmid called pVA1. The presence of this plasmid in V. parahaemolyticus is determinant for disease development. Its propagation is not only linked to bacterial colonisation capacity but also to horizontal gene transfer mechanisms. Nevertheless, the active uptake of plasmid, which is known as natural genetic transformation (NGT), has not yet been proposed as a possible acquisition mechanism of the pVA1 plasmid among Vibrio species. Previous studies suggest that some Vibrio species have the ability to undergo NGT in the presence of chitin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the induction of NGT mediated by chitin in V. parahaemolyticus (ATCC-17802) through its ability to incorporate and express the pVA1 plasmid. The results showed that a reference strain that does not initially contain the plasmid can incorporate the plasmid under the appropriate transformation conditions, and cause mortality in white shrimp similar to that observed for pathogenic strains isolated from infectious outbreaks. Given the management and conditions of a shrimp farm with large amounts of chitinous exoskeletons, it is feasible that NGT could be a possible acquisition mechanism of plasmid pVA1 among Vibrio species, turning a non-causative strain of V. parahaemolyticus into a causative strain. With this study, we have expanded the knowledge of the pathogenesis process mediated by NGT and the understanding of the possible propagation mechanisms of emerging diseases in the aquaculture sector. labels: #Animals#Aquaculture#Penaeidae#Plasmids#Transformation, Genetic#Vibrio parahaemolyticus'
b'AIM: The effects of diosmin (DS), pentoxifylline (PTX) and their combination on inflammatory response, oxidant/antioxidant balance, cytoglobin and cirrhotic reaction during bile duct ligation (BDL) were investigated and explored.MAIN METHODS: Fifty adult male Wistar albino rats were randomly allocated to five groups as following, sham: received vehicle only, BDL: subjected to common BDL without treatment, BDL plus DS: received 100\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg/kg/day orally, BDL plus PTX: received 50\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg/kg/day orally, BDL plus DS plus PTX: received DS and PTX in the same manner. The test period lasted 28\\xe2\\x80\\xafdays, liver tissues and blood samples were collected to investigate biochemical markers (liver function biomarkers, oxidative stress markers, and antifibrotic markers), mRNA expression of Nrf-2, Keap-1, NF-\\xc3\\xaaB-p65 and p38-MAPK by real-time PCR, protein expression of cytoglobin and NF-\\xc3\\xaaB-p65 by western blot and iNOS and eNOS by immunohistochemistry. Histopathological study was performed to confirm our results.KEY FINDINGS: Chronic BDL induced a significant alteration in liver functions, oxidative stress and fibrotic markers. Furthermore, unfavorable effects on gene and protein expression were observed after BDL. Histopathological findings of this group showed parallel effects. DS, PTX and their combination treatment significantly ameliorated the disturbance that occurred due to BDL. Similar findings were observed in liver histopathology.SIGNIFICANCE: DS and PTX could mitigate liver cirrhosis through modulation of Keap-1/Nrf-2/GSH and NF-\\xc3\\xaaB-p65/p38-MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, we demonstrated that the hepatoprotective effect of DS and PTX is mediated by up-regulation of cytoglobin with inhibition of fibrotic reaction. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Scavenging of nitric oxide (NO) often interferes with studies on NO signaling in cell-free preparations. We observed that formation of cGMP by NO-stimulated purified soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) was virtually abolished in the presence of cytosolic preparations of porcine coronary arteries, with the scavenging activity localized in the tunica media (smooth muscle layer). Electrochemical measurement of NO release from a donor compound and light absorbance spectroscopy showed that cytosolic preparations contained a reduced heme protein that scavenged NO. This protein, which reacted with anti-human hemoglobin antibodies, was efficiently removed from the preparations by haptoglobin affinity chromatography. The cleared cytosols showed only minor scavenging of NO according to electrochemical measurements and did not decrease cGMP formation by NO-stimulated sGC. In contrast, the column flow-through caused a nearly 2-fold increase of maximal sGC activity (from 33.1 \\xc2\\xb1 1.6 to 54.9 \\xc2\\xb1 2.2 \\xc3\\xacmol ? min(-1) ? mg(-1)). The proteins retained on the affinity column were identified as hemoglobin \\xc3\\xa1 and \\xc3\\xa2 subunits. The results indicate that hemoglobin, presumably derived from vasa vasorum erythrocytes, is present and scavenges NO in preparations of porcine coronary artery smooth muscle. Selective removal of hemoglobin-mediated scavenging unmasked stimulation of maximal NO-stimulated sGC activity by a soluble factor expressed in vascular tissue. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'For sequences that are highly divergent, there is often insufficient information to infer accurate alignments, and phylogenetic uncertainty may be high. One way to address this issue is to make use of protein structural information, since structures generally diverge more slowly than sequences. In this work, we extend a recently developed stochastic model of pairwise structural evolution to multiple structures on a tree, analytically integrating over ancestral structures to permit efficient likelihood computations under the resulting joint sequence-structure model. We observe that the inclusion of structural information significantly reduces alignment and topology uncertainty, and reduces the number of topology and alignment errors in cases where the true trees and alignments are known. In some cases, the inclusion of structure results in changes to the consensus topology, indicating that structure may contain additional information beyond that which can be obtained from sequences. We use the model to investigate the order of divergence of cytoglobins, myoglobins, and hemoglobins and observe a stabilization of phylogenetic inference: although a sequence-based inference assigns significant posterior probability to several different topologies, the structural model strongly favors one of these over the others and is more robust to the choice of data set.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'A de novo designed intramolecular disulfide bond in myoglobin, resembling that in cytoglobin without structural evidence, was confirmed by an X-ray structure for the first time and was demonstrated to regulate both the structure and function of this protein, which fulfills the design of an artificial dehaloperoxidase, with an activity exceeding that of a native enzyme. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of T2WI signal intensity related parameters that can be obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with locally advanved rectal cancer (LARC). Methods: Signal Intensity of Tumor (SIT) and Signal Intensity of Tumor/Muscle (SIT/M) of MR T2WI before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of 101 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were evaluated by two experienced readers independently. Signal Intensity of Tumor Reduction Rate (SITRR) and Signal Intensity of Tumor/Muscle Reduction Rate (SIT/MRR) were calculated. The difference of related parameters of T2WI tumor signal intensity between the pCR and the non-pCR group were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance for predicting pCR. Results: Of the 101 patients, 18 were in pCR group and 83 were in non-pCR group. In all patients, the SITpre, SITpost, SITRR, SIT/Mpre, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by reader 1 were 197.0 (133.0), 144.2 (69.7), 0.4% (0.5%), 2.6 (0.6), 3.0 (2.3) and 0.4 (0.2)% in pCR group, and 227.0 (99.0), 205 (95.4), 0.1% (0.6%), 2.6 (0.6), 2.6 (1) in non-pCR group, respectively. SITpre, SITpost, SITRR, SIT/Mpre, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by reader 2 were 193.0 (135.0), 143.0 (69.8), 0.4% (0.2%), 2.6 (0.6), 1.5 (0.5) and 0.39% (0.2%) in pCR group, and 234.0(108.0), 203(96.5), 0.1% (0.3%), 2.6 (0.6%), 1.7 (0.7) and 0.25% (0.2%) in non-pCR group, respectively. Between the pCR and non-pCR group, there were significant differences in SITpost, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by both readers (all P<0.01), but there was no significant differences in SITpre and SIT/Mpre (P>0.05). The difference of SITRR measured by reader 1 was not statistically significant (P=0.415), while the difference of SITRR measured by reader 2 was statistically significant (P=0.001). In patients with rectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, SITpost, SIT/Mpost, SITRR and SIT/MRR measured by two physicians were still statistically significant between the pCR and non-pCR group (all P<0.01), but SITpre and SIT/Mpre had no significant difference (P>0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that in all patients, the area under curve (AUC) of SITpost, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer was 0.694-0.762, the sensitivity was 68.2%-77.3%, and the specificity was 63.6%-77.3%. In rectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma patients, the AUC, sensitivity and specificity was 0.704-0.764, 62.7%-78.9% and 66.2%-84.2%, respectively. Conclusions: T2WI signal intensity related parameters are potential predictors for pCR in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiptherapy. The predictive value is higher in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. labels: #Chemoradiotherapy#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Neoadjuvant Therapy#ROC Curve#Rectal Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome'
b'In the present paper, we introduce a newly modified device named "transcutaneous electrical auricular concha stimulator (TEACS)" for rats. It concludes a main unit (power and control buttons) with newly designed specific output electrodes. Each of the output electrode is made up of two pieces of iron sheet containing magnet and can be firmly attached to the auricular concha and the corresponding site of dorsal auricle, respectively. The two iron sheets are separately connected to each of the output terminal of the main unit via two pieces of wire. This newly modified output electrode replaces the original wire clip, and solves the problems of easy loosening and easy injury of the original spring clip due to repeated usage, being simple, flexible and convenient in application. labels: #Animals#Electric Stimulation Therapy#Rats#Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation'
b'De-escalation strategy is the gradual transition of various complex, expensive, high-risk but effective treatments for critically ill patients to simple, safe, physiological but still effective ones. Chronic critical illness refers to patients suffering severe disease or surgical hit who later shift into a chronic state of relapse or even aggravation and stay in the intensive care unit for extended period. Risk factors for surgical related chronic critical illness include advanced age, malnutrition, multiple organ dysfunction and multiple hits. During the treatment of critically ill patients, the strategy of de-escalation therapy should always be implemented, including rational use of antibiotics, de-escalation of liquid therapy (i.e. de-resuscitation), timely removal of ventilator, rapid introduction and with drawal of continuous renal replacement measures, parenteral + enteral nutrition support therapy and timely cessation of sedation. labels: #Chronic Disease#Conservative Treatment#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Intensive Care Units#Withholding Treatment'
b'This retrospective study investigated the effect of the novel bone graft transverse process strut (TPS) in single segmental thoracic spinal tuberculosis (TB) with the one-stage posterior approach of debridement, fusion, and internal instrumentation. Thirty patients treated in our department from March 2014 to October 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Surgical time, blood loss, hospitalization time, drainage volume, and follow-up (FU) duration were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, segmental angle, and bone fusion were compared between preoperative and final FU. All the patients were followed for a mean 50.10\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a25.10 months; the mean age, surgical time in minutes, blood loss, hospitalization time, and drainage volume were 46.23\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a17.20 years, 195.08\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a24.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes, 280.77\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a189.90\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, 17.31\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a4.23 days, 436.92\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a193.81\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, respectively. VAS and ODI scores were significantly improved at the final FU. The ESR and CRP returned to normal. All patients achieved bony fusion with a mean time of 5.85\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.82 months and a mean segmental angle of 18.77\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.49\\xc2\\xb0 preoperatively, which significantly decreased to 9.31\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.54\\xc2\\xb0 at the final FU (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). No complications, such as bone graft failure, pleural effusion, fistula, or wound infection were recorded except for cerebrospinal fluid leakage (one case), water electrolyte imbalance (5 cases), superficial infection (1 case), and mild intestinal obstruction (1 case).

b'Schizopygopsis pylzovi, an endemic fish of the subfamily Schizothoracinae, is comparatively well adapted to dissolved oxygen fluctuations in the aqueous environments of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Here, we cloned the complete cDNA of cytoglobin 1 and 2 (Cygb1 and Cygb2) from S. pylzovi and then investigated transcriptional changes of both genes in the selected tissues in response to hypoxia. Both the two genes had the standard exon-intron structure of vertebrate Mb genes but lacked an exon at downstream of the H helix (HC11.2) as seen in mammals. We applied severe hypoxia (4\\xc2\\xa0h at PO2\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x893.6% saturation) and moderate hypoxia (72\\xc2\\xa0h at PO2\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x8936.0% saturation) to adult S. pylzovi. Under severe hypoxia, the Cygb1 mRNA levels decreased significantly in the liver, kidney, and brain, but increased significantly in the heart, while the Cygb2 mRNA levels downregulated significantly in the muscle and liver. But, the transcriptional activity of Cygb1 in muscle and that of Cygb2 in the kidney, brain, and heart remained almost unchanged. Under moderate hypoxia, the transcriptional activities of both genes in muscle and brain were turned down quickly after onset hypoxia, while in the liver, kidney, and heart, the transcriptional activities of both genes showed a short-term upregulation in different time periods of hypoxia exposure. Our data suggest that both the Cygb1 and Cygb2 in S. pylzovi are hypoxia-induced genes, and the responses of the transcription regulation of Cygb1 and Cygb2 genes to hypoxia are tissue specific and also depend on the hypoxia regime, which are different from that of other fish species. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To investigate the expression of fragile-site associated tumor suppressor (FATS) in non-small cell lung cancer and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Methods: A total of 140 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 30 adjacent normal tissues were used to detect the expression level of FATS protein, and to analyze the relationship of FATS protein expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of NSCLC. Results: Western blot showed that the expression of FATS in adjacent normal tissues was significantly higher than that in non-small cell lung cancer tissues. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the high expression rate of FATS in 140 cases of NSCLC was 40.0%, and the high expression rate of FATS in 30 cases of adjacent tissues was 73.3%. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.01). Further analysis showed that the TNM stage (P=0.044) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.022) were significant difference between FATS high expression group and low expression group. The 6-year overall survival (OS) rates of NSCLC patients with FATS high-expression and low-expression were 57.1% and 23.8%, respectively, and the 6-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 53.6% and 21.4%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P=0.001). In Cox multivariate analysis, we found gender (HR=1.658, P=0.028; HR=1.684, P=0.023), TNM staging (HR=2.327, P=0.019; HR=2.332, P=0.013) and FATS expression (HR=0.532, P=0.010; HR=0.538, P=0.009) were independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS of NSCLC patients. Conclusions: The expression of FATS protein is associated with the development and is an independent prognostic factor of NSCLC patients. The detection of FATS protein is expected to be a new biomarker for evaluating the prognosis of NSCLC patients. labels: #Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Cytoskeletal Proteins#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Lung Neoplasms#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis'
b'PURPOSE: This prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial evaluated the relationship between alveolar ridge dimensional change and recession with the implant position (horizontal and vertical) and tissue phenotype in immediately placed and provisionalised implants without the use of bone grafting.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 40) with a hopeless maxillary anterior tooth received an immediate implant and immediate provisional or customised healing abutment after flapless extraction. Implants were finally restored 3 months after placement and followed up for 6 months after delivery of the restoration. The alveolar ridge dimensional change and recession were measured using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and digitalised dental casts. Alveolar contour changes were correlated to implant position and tissue phenotype.RESULTS: The tissue phenotype showed no significant correlation to the alveolar ridge dimensional change. At 6 months, the average alveolar ridge dimensional change was approximately 0.7 mm in the buccolingual dimension independent of tissue phenotype. A statistically significant difference was observed on the recession values comparing tissue phenotypes, with more recession observed in the thin phenotype (1.96 mm) than in the thick phenotype (1.18 mm). A significant correlation was observed between horizontal implant position and buccolingual alveolar ridge change. A positive correlation was observed between the horizontal implant position and the dimensional change measured in the casts at the level of the free gingival margin. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the horizontal implant position and the resorption measured by the CBCT scans.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thin tissue phenotype had a more marked recession. The horizontal implant position showed a relationship to the alveolar ridge dimensional changes observed. The greater the buccal gap distance between the implant and the buccal plate, the lesser the radiographic changes observed in the alveolar bone, however, the greater the changes observed in the buccal aspect of the casts at the level of the free gingival margin. labels: #Alveolar Process#Dental Implants, Single-Tooth#Gingival Recession#Humans#Phenotype#Prospective Studies'
b'During physiological aerobic metabolism, the epidermis undergoes significant oxidative stress as a result of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To maintain a balanced oxidative state, cells have developed protective antioxidant systems, and preliminary studies suggest that the transcriptional factor p63 is involved in cellular oxidative defence. Supporting this hypothesis, the \\xc3\\x84Np63\\xc3\\xa1 isoform of p63 is expressed at high levels in the proliferative basal layer of the epidermis. Here we identify the CYGB gene as a novel transcriptional target of \\xc3\\x84Np63 that is involved in maintaining epidermal oxidative defence. The CYGB gene encodes cytoglobin, a member of the globin protein family, which facilitates the diffusion of oxygen through tissues and acts as a scavenger for nitric oxide or other ROS. By performing promoter activity assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and western blotting analyses, we confirm the direct regulation of CYGB by \\xc3\\x84Np63\\xc3\\xa1. We also demonstrate that CYGB has a protective role in proliferating keratinocytes grown under normal conditions, as well as in cells treated with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that \\xc3\\x84Np63, through its target CYGB has an important role in the cellular antioxidant system and protects keratinocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The \\xc3\\x84Np63-CYGB axis is also present in lung and breast cancer cell lines, indicating that CYGB-mediated ROS-scavenging activity may also have a role in epithelial tumours. In human lung cancer data sets, the p63-CYGB interaction significantly predicts reduction of patient survival.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'The Australian native marine fish species, silver sweep Scorpis lineolata, is susceptible to the megalocytivirus Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (strain DGIV-10) obtained from a freshwater ornamental fish, dwarf gourami Trichogaster lalius. This was demonstrated by direct inoculation and through cohabitation. Transmission by cohabitation was also demonstrated from inoculated freshwater Murray cod Maccullochella peelii to euryhaline Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata and to marine silver sweep. The virus was also transmitted from infected marine silver sweep to euryhaline Australian bass and then to freshwater Murray cod. This study is the first to demonstrate the virulence of a megalocytivirus derived from ornamental fish in an Australian marine species and the first to show a feasible pathway for the exchange of megalocytiviruses between freshwater and marine finfish hosts. These results demonstrate that megalocytiviruses from freshwater ornamental fish have the potential to spread to diverse aquatic environments. labels: #Animals#Australia#DNA Virus Infections#Fish Diseases#Fresh Water#Iridoviridae#Phylogeny'
b'The Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) published the guidelines 2019 for the treatment of colorectal cancer in March 2019. The new edition expanded the indications of endoscopic treatment, enriched the follow-up recommendations after endoscopic resection of early colorectal cancer, supplemented the indications of ISR and added the recommendations of lymph node recurrence and peritoneal recurrence. In the new edition, the adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy schemes were revised and patients with first-line chemotherapy were divided into three categories as follows: appropriate for intensive systemic therapy (fit), inappropriate for intensive systemic therapy (vulnerable), and inappropriate for systemic therapy (frail). The new edition of guidelines can also provide references to the doctors of colorectal cancer in our country.

b'RATIONALE: Managing the health of vulnerable groups is an important component of health care. Given the long-term burden of radiation-release incidents among those exposed, managing the health of vulnerable groups following a nuclear disaster is very important. However, there is limited information available concerning the long-term management of the health effects of radiation exposure in vulnerable groups following nuclear disasters. After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, Minamisoma City launched internal radiation exposure monitoring program for local residents, using whole body counter (WBC) units. In 2017, a man of low socio-economic status (SES), was found to have the highest level of internal contamination detected in a person living in the Soma District in recent years. This report describes the case so that the lessons learned can be applied in future nuclear disaster settings.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old Japanese man, who had been homeless for 2 months and had been staying in the exclusion zone of Minamisoma City, was brought to our hospital. He had become homeless because a lack of communication between social support services had led to his eviction from leased housing after free housing support for evacuees was terminated.DIAGNOSES: He was admitted with a diagnosis of dehydration and malnutrition. A WBC unit was used to assess his body burden of radioactive cesium. This revealed levels of Cs-134 and Cs-137 of 538\\xe2\\x80\\x8aBq/body and 4,993\\xe2\\x80\\x8aBq/body, respectively.INTERVENTION: He received intravenous fluid therapy and health monitoring. The paperwork required for him to receive public income support was processed during hospitalization.OUTCOME: He was discharged to public housing after 9 days, and municipal workers started visiting him regularly after his discharge.LESSONS: A high level of internal radiation contamination may occur after a nuclear disaster. This may be associated with a decline in social support, poverty, and social isolation, and may have more impact on people in poor health than on the general population. It would be useful to strengthen linkages between local government and welfare service providers to increase social support for vulnerable groups requiring health care, not only following disasters, but also under normal circumstances. labels: #Aged#Fukushima Nuclear Accident#Humans#Male#Radiation Exposure#Social Class#Time Factors#Whole-Body Counting'
b'Human cardiac stem/progenitor cells (hCPCs) may serve in regenerative medicine to repair the infarcted heart. However, this approach is severely limited by the poor survival of donor cells. Recent studies suggest that the mammalian globin cytoglobin (CYGB) regulates nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and cell death. In the present study, we found that CYGB is expressed in hCPCs. Through molecular approaches aimed at increasing or decreasing CYGB expression in hCPCs, we found that CYGB functions as a pro-survival factor in response to oxidative stress. This was associated with the upregulation of primary antioxidant systems such as peroxiredoxins-1, heme oxygenase-1, and anti-apoptotic factors, including BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1. Most significantly, we established that CYGB increased the expression of NF?B-dependent genes including iNOS, and that iNOS-dependent NO production was required for a feedforward loop that maintains CYGB expression. Our study delineates for the first time a role for a globin in regulating hCPC survival and establishes mechanistic insights in the function of CYGB. It provides a rationale for the exploration of the CYGB pathway as a molecular target that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cardiac stem/progenitor cell therapy for ischemic heart disease. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Cell proliferation and migration are crucial in many physiological processes including development, cancer, tissue repair, and wound healing. Cell migration is regulated by several signaling molecules. Identification of genes related to cell migration is required to understand molecular mechanism of non-healing chronic wounds which is a major concern in clinics. In the current study, the role of cytoglobin (CYGB) gene in f?broblast cell migration and proliferation was described. L929 mouse fibroblast cells were transduced with lentiviral particles for CYGB and GFP, and analyzed for cell proliferation and migration ability. Fibroblast cells overexpressing CYGB displayed decreased cell proliferation, colony formation capacity, and cell migration. Phosphorylation levels of mTOR and two downstream effectors S6 and 4E-BP1 which take part in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling declined in CYGB-overexpressing cells. Microarray analysis indicated that CYGB overexpression leads to downregulation of cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth associated genes in L929 cell line. This study demonstrated the role of CYGB in fibroblast cell motility and proliferation. CYGB could be a promising candidate for further studies as a potential target for diseases related to cell migration such as cancer and chronic wound treatment. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the predictive performances of anatomic staging system (AS) and prognostic staging system (PS) proposed in the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual in patients with pure mucinous breast cancer (PMBC). Methods: Clinicopathologic features and follow-up information were collected from a total of 3628 patients with PMBC. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were compared among patients in different stage groups. Likelihood ratio (LR) \\xc3\\xb7(2), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were used to evaluate the predictive performances of AS and PS in PMBC. Results: In PMBC, BCSS was associated with tumor size (P=0.002), lymph node status (P=0.002), grade(P=0.003), PR status(P=0.017)and the receipt of radiation. Compared to AS, 1326 patients (37.54%) underwent stage change after applying PS, with 6.50% upstaged and 37.04% downstaged. There were significant differences in BCSS among patients of different stages under the AS and PS (P<0.001). However, PS was not superior to AS in predicting prognosis (AS vs PS, LR \\xc3\\xb7(2): 16.41 vs 17.5; AIC: 357.44 vs 358.35; C-index, 0.72 vs 0.73, P=0.667). Conclusions: Both of AS and PS proposed in the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual were predictive factors in patients with PMBC. Compared with AS, the PS did not show superiority in prognosis prediction among patients with PMBC. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Humans#Likelihood Functions#Neoplasm Grading#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Survival Rate#United States"
b'Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are considered to be the main cause of spontaneous abortion (SA). We aimed to determine the differences in the rates and numbers of chromosomal abnormalities between samples from women with a history of one versus more than one SA as well as between samples from first- and second-trimester SAs in women from Northeast China.In total, 1210 products of conception (POCs) from patients with a history of one or more SAs were examined. Of these 1210 samples, 434 were from women with a history of 1 SA, and 776 were from women with a history of more than 1 SA. Additionally, 1071 samples were from the first trimester, 118 were from the second trimester, and 21 were from the third trimester. We identified chromosomal abnormalities by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Among the 1210 POCs in women with SA, 607 (50.17%) had fetal chromosomal abnormalities. There were no significant differences in the rates of chromosomal abnormalities according to the abortion frequency. However, first-trimester SA had a significantly higher percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities than second-trimester SA (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). Among 663 chromosomal abnormalities, 633 abnormalities occurred in first-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 16 (14.38%), followed by monosomy X (13.27%), trisomy 22 (7.90%), and trisomy 15 (5.37%). Thirty abnormalities occurred in second-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 18 (26.67%), followed by monosomy X (16.67%), trisomy 21 (13.33%), and trisomy 13 (10.00%). No chromosomal abnormalities occurred in the third trimester.These findings indicate the importance of determining the genetic cause of abortion in patients with a history of SA. We also identified a trend suggesting that the percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities is significantly higher in first- than second-trimester SA. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in POCs from SA can be increased by NGS, which is beneficial for couples with recurrent miscarriages and offers better genetic counseling in the clinical setting. labels: #Abortion, Spontaneous#Chromosome Aberrations#DNA Copy Number Variations#Female#Fetus#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Pregnancy'
b'The cytoglobins of the Antarctic fish Chaenocephalus aceratus and Dissostichus mawsoni have many features in common with human cytoglobin. These cytoglobins are heme proteins in which the ferric and ferrous forms have a characteristic hexacoordination of the heme iron, i.e. axial ligation of two endogenous histidine residues, as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance, resonance Raman and optical absorption spectroscopy. The combined spectroscopic analysis revealed only small variations in the heme-pocket structure, in line with the small variations observed for the redox potential. Nevertheless, some striking differences were also discovered. Resonance Raman spectroscopy showed that the stabilization of an exogenous heme ligand, such as CO, occurs differently in human cytoglobin in comparison with Antarctic fish cytoglobins. Furthermore, while it has been extensively reported that human cytoglobin is essentially monomeric and can form an intramolecular disulfide bridge that can influence the ligand binding kinetics, 3D modeling of the Antarctic fish cytoglobins indicates that the cysteine residues are too far apart to form such an intramolecular bridge. Moreover, gel filtration and mass spectrometry reveal the occurrence of non-covalent multimers (up to pentamers) in the Antarctic fish cytoglobins that are formed at low concentrations. Stabilization of these oligomers by disulfide-bridge formation is possible, but not essential. If intermolecular disulfide bridges are formed, they influence the heme-pocket structure, as is shown by EPR measurements. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"If the abdominal pedicled flaps are not well fixed after repair of deep electric burn wounds in hands, many problems such as poor blood supply may occur. In order to solve the above problems, we designed and manufactured the individualized low temperature thermoplastic plate combined with special abdominal band to fix abdominal pedicled flaps for repairing of 17 patients (12 males and 5 females, aged 2-35 years) with deep electric burn wounds in hands from February 2016 to August 2018, and achieved the desired results. The shoulder joint, elbow joint, and wrist joint were fixed by low temperature thermoplastic plate according to the 1/2 circumference of the patient's side chest and upper arm, and the braking of wrist joint and elbow joint was strengthened by special abdominal band. Application of the combined method of fixing abdominal pedicled flaps in repairing deep electric burn wounds in hands has high success rate of flap transplantation. It is simple to make and practical, and worthy of clinical promotion. labels: #Abdomen#Adolescent#Adult#Burns, Electric#Child#Child, Preschool#Cold Temperature#Female#Hand Injuries#Humans#Male#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Surgical Flaps#Wound Healing#Young Adult"
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and related proteins of inflammation and anti-oxidative stress in spinal cord in mice with spinal cord injury (SCI), so as to explore its mechanisms underlying function repair.METHODS: Thirty-six female C57BL/6 mice were equally randomized into 3 groups: sham operation, model and EA. The SCI model was established by clamping the spinal cord for 25 s with a serrefine after laminectomy of the 1st lumbar vertebra (L1). EA (1.5 Hz/7.5 Hz, 1.0 mA) was applied to bila-teral "Zusanli" (ST36) and "Sanyinjiao" (SP6) for 10 min, once a day for 7 days. The hindlimb locomotor function was assessed according to the state of the range of motion, coordination, claw gesture of the hind leg ankle-joint, trunk stabi-lity and the tail posture by using Basso Mouse Scale(BMS). The histopathological changes of the injured area of the spinal cord were determined by H.E. staining. The expression levels of ApoE, phosphorylated nuclear transcription factor-\\xc3\\xaaB(p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB), interleukin 1 beta(IL-1\\xc3\\xa2), phosphorylated extracellular regulatory protein kinase(p-ERK1/2), extracellular regulatory protein kinase(ERK1/2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) and heme oxidase-1(HO-1) in the spinal cord were detected by Western blot, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were displayed by immunofluorescence staining.RESULTS: After modeling, the BMS scores were significantly decreased in the model group compared with the sham operation group (P<0.05). Following EA, the BMS scores were markedly increased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05), suggesting an improvement of the hindlimb locomotor function. H.E. stain showed structural disorder with lots of cavities, severe inflammatory infiltration with large quantity of inflammatory cells, and apparent reduction of normal neurons in the injured spinal cord tissue of model group, which was milder in the EA group. The expression levels of ApoE, p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB, IL-1\\xc3\\xa2, p-ERK1/2 (not ERK1/2), Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly increased in the model group than those in the sham operation group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression levels of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, Nrf2 and HO-1 were further notably up-regulated (P<0.05), and those of p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 proteins obviously down-regulated in the EA group (P<0.05). Immunoflorescence staining showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells was apparently increased in the model group compared with the sham operation group and observably decreased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: EA can significantly improve locomotor function in SCI mice, which is associated with its effects in reducing inflammation, oxi-dative stress reactions and reactive astrocyte proliferation via up-regulating expression of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, and Nrf2/HO-1 (antioxidant pathway) and inhibiting IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 and NF-\\xc3\\xaaB expression. labels: #Animals#Electroacupuncture#Female#Heat-Shock Proteins#Inflammation#Locomotion#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Oxidative Stress#Spinal Cord#Spinal Cord Injuries'
b'Earlier kinetics studies on cytoglobin did not assign functional properties to specific structural forms. Here, we used defined monomeric and dimeric forms and cysteine mutants to show that an intramolecular disulfide bond (C38-C83) alters the dissociation rate constant of the intrinsic histidine (H81) (?1000 fold), thus controlling binding of extrinsic ligands. Through time-resolved spectra we have unequivocally assigned CO binding to hexa- and penta-coordinate forms and have made direct measurement of histidine rebinding following photolysis. We present a model that describes how the cysteine redox state of the monomer controls histidine dissociation rate constants and hence extrinsic ligand binding. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of adult rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients. Methods: The clinical data of 34 adult RMS patients were retrospectively analyzed. Based on their intervention and treatment, patients were divided into operation group (n=7), chemotherapy group (n=8) and operation plus chemotherapy group (n=19). The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of the three groups were compared. Results: A statically significant difference was found in IRSG surgical-pathological stage among the three groups (P=0.026), while no significant difference existed in gender, age of disease onset, primary site, tumor size, pathological subtypes and IRSG risk group in the three groups (all P>0.05). In the operation group, three CR, one PR, one SD and two PD were achieved and one CR, one PR, one SD and five PD were obtained in the chemotherapy group. While in the chemotherapy plus operation group, four CR, twelve PR, one SD and two PD were achieved. A significant difference was found in response (P=0.043) and median overall survival (OS) (P=0.036) among the three groups, which were 44.7, 26.9 and 53.6 months, respectively. Conclusions: Pleomorphic RMS was the main histological subtype for adult RMS patients, and the prognosis for adult RMS was usually poorer than that for pediatric RMS patients. Single therapeutic approach could not achieve satisfactory outcomes, while multimodal treatment consisted of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are helpful to improve the prognosis of adult patients with RMS. labels: #Adult#Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Combined Modality Therapy#Humans#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Rhabdomyosarcoma#Treatment Outcome'
b"Acanthurus spp. of St. Kitts and other Caribbean islands, including ocean surgeonfish A. bahianus, doctorfish A. chirurgus, and blue tang A. coeruleus, frequently show multifocal cutaneous pigmentation. Initial reports from the Leeward Antilles raised suspicion of a parasitic etiology. The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of the disease in St. Kitts' Acanthuridae and describe its pathology and etiology. Visual surveys demonstrated consistently high adjusted mean prevalence at 3 shallow reefs in St. Kitts in 2017 (38.9%, 95% CI: 33.8-43.9) and 2018 (51.5%; 95% CI: 46.2-56.9). There were no differences in prevalence across species or reefs, but juvenile fish were less commonly affected than adults. A total of 29 dermatopathy-affected acanthurids were sampled by spearfishing for comprehensive postmortem examination. Digenean metacercariae were dissected from <1 mm cysts within pigmented lesions. Using partial 28S rDNA sequence data they were classified as Family Heterophyidae, members of which are commonly implicated in black spot disease of other fishes. Morphological features of the parasite were most typical of Scaphanocephalus spp. (Creplin, 1842), and 2 genetic profiles were obtained suggesting more than 1 digenean species. Histologically, pigmented lesions had mild chronic perivascular dermatitis and increased melanophores and melanin density, often centered on encysted digenean metacercariae. In 1 affected A. chirurgus, similar metacercariae were histologically identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Further research is needed to clarify impact on host fitness, establish the number of heterophyid digenean species that cause black spots on Caribbean fishes and to determine the intermediate and definitive host species. labels: #Animals#Caribbean Region#Dermatitis#Metacercariae#Perciformes#West Indies"
b'BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in some patients who achieve sustained virological response (SVR) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection via anti-HCV therapy. To examine the pathogenesis of HCC development after HCV eradication, histopathological changes and clinical markers were evaluated in SVR patients.METHODS: Of 654 SVR patients treated with interferon (IFN)-based therapies, 34 patients who had undergone liver biopsy before initiating IFN therapy and after SVR achievement were enrolled: 11 patients with HCC and 23 patients without HCC (male/female, 9/2 and 8/15, respectively: age, 58 \\xc2\\xb1 5 and 54 \\xc2\\xb1 11 years, respectively). We compared the clinical and histopathological factors between the two groups. Immunohistochemistry for Cytoglobin (CYGB) and \\xc3\\xa1 smooth muscle actin (\\xc3\\xa1-SMA) was also performed.RESULTS: At baseline, prior to initiating the IFN-based therapy, there were significant differences between the SVR-non-HCC and SVR-HCC groups in the male gender, HBc antibody positivity, prothrombin activity, and histological inflammatory grade. Histopathological evaluation, using the new Inuyama classification system, revealed an improvement in the inflammatory grade, from 2.1 \\xc2\\xb1 0.6 to 1.0 \\xc2\\xb1 0.6 (p < 0.0001), whereas the fibrosis stage remained unchanged, from 2.3 \\xc2\\xb1 0.9 to 2.0 \\xc2\\xb1 1.2 (p = 0.2749), during the 97 \\xc2\\xb1 72-month observation period in the SVR-HCC group. Both the grade and stage scores were significantly improved in the SVR-non-HCC group. The area of collagen deposition, evaluated using Sirius red staining, showed a marked decrease, from 18.6 \\xc2\\xb1 7.6% to 7.7 \\xc2\\xb1 4.6%, in the SVR-non-HCC group, with no change in the SVR-HCC group. CYGB- and \\xc3\\xa1-SMA-positive hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicative of the HSC activated phenotype, remained in the fibrotic tissue of livers among patients in the SVR-HCC group.CONCLUSION: Stagnation of fibrosis regression is associated with a high risk for HCC after SVR. HSC activation may inhibit improvement in fibrosis after SVR and potentially contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To investigate the changes of perioperative immune index in patients with breast cancer and its clinical significance. Methods: Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th1/Th2 ratio and regulatory T cells (Treg) were detected in peripheral blood of 103 patients with primary breast cancer and 116 patients with breast fibroma before surgery and on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day following operation. The relationship of changes in T lymphocyte subsets and clinicopathological characteristics, as well as tumor-free survival of breast cancer patients, was analyzed. Results: The levels of Th1 cells in breast cancer group on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day following operation were (12.20\\xc2\\xb10.45)%, (13.89\\xc2\\xb10.47)%, (14.04\\xc2\\xb10.49)%, which were significantly lower than those before operation [(15.82 + 0.51)%, all P<0.05 ]. Treg cells, however, with the number of (3.82\\xc2\\xb10.13)%, (3.25\\xc2\\xb10.11)%, (2.95 \\xc2\\xb10.11)%, were remarkably higher than those before operation [(2.53 \\xc2\\xb10.11)%, all P<0.05]. With respect to breast fibroma patients, there was no significant difference compared with those before operation of Th1 cells, Th2 cells and Treg cells (all P>0.05). The changes of Th1 cells were associated with the degree of differentiation, T stage, N stage, TNM stage, HER-2 status and Ki-67 (all P<0.05). Treg cells were related to T stage, N stage and HER-2 status (all P<0.05). Tumor-free survival in the Th1-cell-increasing group was significantly better than that in the Th1-cell-decreasing group (P=0.045), while cell-decreasing group of Treg showed the improved outcomes (P=0.012). Conclusions: The levels of Th1 cells and Treg cells are important indicators of cellular immune function in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, the perioperative changes of Th1 cells and Treg cells are associated with the size of tumors, pathological parameters, clinical stages and tumor-free survival outcomes. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Immunity, Cellular#T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory#Th1-Th2 Balance'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of scalp-acupuncture on the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), Interleukin (IL)-1\\xc3\\xa2, zonula occludens-1(ZO-1) mRNA and Occludin mRNA in striatum in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (AICD) rats, so as to investigate its mechanisms underlying improvement of AICD.METHODS: Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly allocated to control, model, IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture groups (n=12 rats in each group). The AICD model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Rats of the IL-1Ra group and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group received intraperitoneal injection of IL-1Ra (0.05 mg\\xc2\\xb7kg-1\\xc2\\xb7d-1), once daily for 6 days. Scalp acupuncture stimulation was applied to bilateral "Dingnieqianxiexian" (MS6) once daily for 6 days for rats in IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group. Before and after intervention, the neurologic deficit score (NDS) was evalua-ted according to Longa\\\'s method. The expression of striatum PTX3 and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA in the striatum tissue were detected by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. The Evans Blue (EB) tracer method was used to monitor the degree of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage.RESULTS: Following modeling, the NDS, EB content and the expression of PTX3 and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 in the striatum tissue were significantly increased, and the ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression was considerably decreased in the model group compared with the control group (P<0.05). After the interventions and compared with the model group, the NDS, EB content in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the striatum ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group were obviously up-regulated (P<0.05), and the expression of IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 was obviously down-regulated in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05) rather than in the IL-1Ra group (P>0.05). The effects of scalp acupuncture combined with IL-1Ra were obviously superior to that of IL-1Ra in down-regulating NDS, EB content and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 expression level, and in up-regulating PTX3, ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression levels (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can improve neurological function and reduce the degree of BBB injury in AICD rats, which may be associated with its function in up-regulating the expression of PTX3 and in promoting the expression of ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#C-Reactive Protein#Cerebrovascular Disorders#Corpus Striatum#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Scalp#Serum Amyloid P-Component'
b'BACKGROUND: Recent genomic information has revealed that neuroglobin and cytoglobin are the two principal lineages of vertebrate hemoglobins, with the latter encompassing the familiar myoglobin and \\xc3\\xa1-globin/\\xc3\\xa2-globin tetramer hemoglobin, and several minor groups. In contrast, very little is known about hemoglobins in echinoderms, a phylum of exclusively marine organisms closely related to vertebrates, beyond the presence of coelomic hemoglobins in sea cucumbers and brittle stars. We identified about 50 hemoglobins in sea urchin, starfish and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, and used Bayesian inference to carry out a molecular phylogenetic analysis of their relationship to vertebrate sequences, specifically, to assess the hypothesis that the neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages are also present in echinoderms.RESULTS: The genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus encodes several hemoglobins, including a unique chimeric 14-domain globin, 2 androglobin isoforms and a unique single androglobin domain protein. Other strongylocentrotid genomes appear to have similar repertoires of globin genes. We carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses of 52 hemoglobins identified in sea urchin, brittle star and sea cucumber genomes and transcriptomes, using different multiple sequence alignment methods coupled with Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. The results demonstrate that there are two major globin lineages in echinoderms, which are related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages. Furthermore, the brittle star and sea cucumber coelomic hemoglobins appear to have evolved independently from the cytoglobin lineage, similar to the evolution of erythroid oxygen binding globins in cyclostomes and vertebrates.CONCLUSION: The presence of echinoderm globins related to the vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin lineages suggests that the split between neuroglobins and cytoglobins occurred in the deuterostome ancestor shared by echinoderms and vertebrates. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Depressive disorder is one of the most widespread forms of mental disorders which lead to a significant public health concern, such as disability, suicide, and so on. Its etiology remains vague but it is believed that depressive disorder is a multifactorial disease which is induced by the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Thus, there is no clear and definite pathological theory could illustrate its mechanism independently until now, involving genetics, neuroimaging, neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine, and others. Comprehensive assessment to patients with depression is the starting point for a right diagnosis. History-taking of physical condition is as important as psychiatric interview and rational usage of scales would be beneficial for screening. There are many kinds of therapeutic measures for depressive patients nowadays, including general intervention, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and physical therapy. For now, anti-depressants used in clinical practice is almost monoamine-based drugs while much more progress have been made in developing new antidepressant medications, like prototypical N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, opioid agonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, and psychedelics. Once these novel drugs are proved to be practicable, it will create a historical evolution in the field of psychiatry. In addition, we advocate that measurement-based care (MBC) should run through the whole duration of treatment and goals of MBC in every stage are different. As brain projects in many countries are conducting in inspiring ways, we believe that our understanding about depressive disorder, of course, and other neuropsychiatric disorders will be better in the future. labels: #Antidepressive Agents#Depression#Depressive Disorder, Major#Humans#Psychotherapy'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of "Buqi Yixue "needling on clinical symptoms, neurological function and nerve conduction velocity in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.METHODS: Eighty-six patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy numbness and pain were equally randomized into control group and treatment group. The patients of the control group received basic treatment and oral administration of Cilostazol (50 mg/time, 2 times/d) and Epalrestat (50 mg/time, 3 times/d). The patients of the treatment group received acupuncture stimulation of Danzhong (CV17), Qihai (CV6), Pishu (BL20), Quchi (LI11), etc., for 30 min, once every day, on the basic treatment. The treatment was conducted for 8 successive weeks. The scores of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptoms, Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were detected before and after the treatment.RESULTS: After the treatment, the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS were considerably decreased (P<0.05), and the NCV was significantly increased (P<0.05) in both groups compared with those of their own pre-treatment. The the-rapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in lowering the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS, and in up-regulating the NCV (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: "Buqi Yixue" needling is effective in improving clinical symptoms and increasing NCV in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Arteries#Diabetes Mellitus#Diabetic Neuropathies#Humans#Medicine, Chinese Traditional#Neural Conduction'
b'HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: Where Are We Today? Abstract. In sub-Saharan Africa the HIV epidemic has changed remarkedly due to expanded testing and easier access to antiretroviral medication. The rate of new infections has decreased substantially since 2005, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has increased and the mortality rate has declined. Yet still a lot needs to be achieved to stop the ongoing epidemic. Women are still at a higher risk to get infected and stigma and discrimination are a hindrance to further reduce the incidence. Challenges like the lack of technical capacities, especially to perform viral load and resistance testing, refusal of testing or condom use and increasing drug resistance to first-line therapies jeopardize the goal of 90-90-90: 90 % of people tested, 90 % of positives under care and 90 % of treated persons virologically controlled. New testing strategies and medication with higher efficacies which, when taken regularly, stop the transmission completely, provide hope in the fight against HIV. labels: #Africa South of the Sahara#Anti-HIV Agents#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Incidence#Social Stigma'
b'PURPOSE: To investigate the possible association of oxidative stress with keratoconus (KC), we estimated the changes in relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content.METHODS: The study included 119 patients with KC and 208 controls matched for gender, ethnicity, and systemic disease status. We selected controls who were older than the patients since the mtDNA copy number tends to increase with age. The age mean (standard deviation) was 26.4(7.6) and 54.5(14.4) years for the patients and controls, respectively. The relative mtDNA copy number was estimated with the real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method using ND1 as the mtDNA gene and human globulin (HGB; also known as the cytoglobin gene, CYGB) as the reference single-copy nuclear gene.RESULTS: The mean relative mtDNA content was significantly higher in patients with KC (1.20\\xc2\\xb10.45) than in the normal control subjects (1.04\\xc2\\xb10.36; p = 0.0004). Subjects with high mtDNA content (>1.259, i.e., greater than 75(th) percentile) were at an increased risk of the disease (odds ratio = 2.62, 95% confidence interval = 1.40 to 4.89; p =0.0025).CONCLUSIONS: Increased mtDNA content in patients with KC may indicate mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and thus mitochondrial-abnormality involvement. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have previously been used for targeted genome editing in various organisms including Xenopus laevis. However, because of genomic polyploidization, X. laevis usually possess homeologous genes (homeologs) with quite similar sequences that make the analysis of gene function difficult. In the present study, we show methodological examples of targeted gene modification of X. laevis homeologs. The X. laevis cytoglobin gene (cygb) consists of two homeologs (xlcygba and xlcygbb), and molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that they have potentially different functions. Thus, there is a need to establish a method of homeolog-specific gene disruption to clarify gene functions in detail. Here, we show successful examples of homeolog-specific and simultaneous gene disruption for xlcygba and xlcygbb. We found that selective digestion can be performed with at least three mismatches in TALEN target sites in both homeologs. This report paves the way for the functional analyses of X. laevis homeologs, even those containing nearly identical sequences. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"Objective: To investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic remedial surgery in patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer after endoscopic resection. Methods: The clinical and follow-up data of 12 patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer and then underwent endoscopic resection was collected. The clinicalpathological features and remedial indications were analyzed to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic remedial surgery. Results: The average number of lymph nodes in the lymph node dissection was 15 during remedial surgery, and 3 of them had lymph node metastasis. Among the 3 patients with residual cancer, two cases were poorly differentiated, 1 case was moderately differentiated, 1 case was positive for basal margin, and 1 case had vascular invasion. No lymph node metastasis occurred in the 9 patients who had no residual cancer. Among these, 8 cases were moderately differentiated, 1 case was poorly differentiated and 2 cases had positive basal margin. The average follow-up duration was 40 months and all 12 patients were in a state of survival at the last follow-up. During the follow-up of the 3 patients with residual cancer, 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with unknown prognosis; 1 patient received postoperative adjuvant radiochemotherapy, and lung metastasis occurred; 1 patient did not receive any treatment after surgery and survived for 33 months. Conclusions: Laparoscopic remedial surgery is a safe and feasible remedy for patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer after endoscopic resection. However, the choice of remedial strategy for colorectal carcinoma needs further investigation for patients with no vascular invasion, high degree of differentiation, and negative basal margin. labels: #Colorectal Neoplasms#Humans#Laparoscopy#Lymph Node Excision#Lymphatic Metastasis#Prognosis#Reoperation#Treatment Outcome"
b'Heart Failure in Africa Abstract. In Africa, mortality due to heart failure is twice as high as in other low- to middle-income countries and five times as high as in high-income countries. Arterial hypertension is by far the most common cause of heart failure, followed by cardiomyopathies and rheumatic heart diseases. At diagnosis, most patients suffer already from an advanced disease stage. Only a few patients are aware of arterial hypertension, and few are treated and have their hypertension well controlled. Only a minority of patients have a well-controlled hypertension. The neglect of chronic non-communicable diseases on the health agenda leads to poor awareness, poor diagnostic resources, preventions strategies and treatment options. International guidelines cannot be properly followed in these circumstances. Information at community level and in healthcare facilities is urgently needed as well as training of healthcare staff, implementation of improved diagnostics and treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure. labels: #Africa#Cardiomyopathies#Heart Failure#Humans#Hypertension#Rheumatic Heart Disease'
b'Medical Daily Routine in the Tropics: A Case-Based Overview Abstract. When we speak about \\xc2\\xabmedicine in the tropics\\xc2\\xbb it is malaria epidemics, diarrheal diseases and worm infections that come to mind. A lesser-known fact is the impact of the new epidemic of non-communicable diseases, which are currently responsible for about half of all deaths occurring in the tropical world regions. Changing demographic, social and economic factors are the drivers for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. The observed increase in non-communicable diseases coupled with the persistence of classic infectious tropical diseases creates a double medical burden and presents a great challenge in these low-resource settings. labels: #Communicable Diseases#Diabetes Mellitus#Epidemics#Humans'
b'Cytoglobin (Cgb) is a member of hemoprotein family with roles in NO metabolism, fibrosis, and tumourigenesis. Similar to other hemoproteins, Cgb structure and functions are markedly influenced by distal key residues. The sixth ligand His(81) (E7) is crucial to exogenous ligand binding, heme pocket conformation, and physiological roles of this protein. However, the effects of other key residues on heme pocket and protein biological functions are not well known. In this work, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of two single mutants in CO-ligated Cgb (L46FCgbCO and L46VCgbCO) and two double mutants (L46FH81QCgbCO and L46VH81QCgbCO) was conducted to explore the effects of the key distal residues Leu(46)(B10) and His(81)(E7) on Cgb structure and functions. Results indicated that the distal mutation of B10 and E7 affected CgbCO dynamic properties on loop region fluctuation, internal cavity rearrangement, and heme motion. The distal conformation change was reflected by the distal key residues Gln(62) (CD3) and Arg(84)(E10). The hydrogen bond between heme propionates with CD3 or E10 residues were evidently influenced by B10/E7 mutation. Furthermore, heme pocket rearrangement was also observed based on the distal pocket volume and occurrence rate of inner cavities. The mutual effects of B10 and E7 residues on protein conformational rearrangement and other dynamic features were expressed in current MD studies of CgbCO and its distal mutants, suggesting their crucial role in heme pocket stabilization, ligand binding, and Cgb biological functions. The mutation of distal B10 and E7 residues affects the dynamic features of carboxy cytoglobin.  labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Cytoglobin (CYGB), a member of the globin family, is thought to protect cells from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and deal with hypoxic conditions and oxidative stress. However, its molecular mechanisms of action are not clearly understood. Through immunoprecipitation combined with a two-dimensional electrophoresis-mass spectrometry assay, we identified a CYGB interactor: aldo-keto reductase family 7 member A2 (AKR7A2). The interaction was further confirmed using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our results show that AKR7A2 physically interacts with CYGB. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Liuwei Dihuang pill (LDP) was assessed for its effects on renal deficiency.90 STZ induced DN rats were divided into groups (n\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a22) without treatment (STZ) and LDP treated (STZ-L) (n\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a23), Zhenwu decoction treated (STZ-Z) (n\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a22), and valsartan treated (STZ-V) (n\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a23) groups, with 16 normal control rats. Total urine protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Cr) were measured. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations as well as expression/phosphorylation of SMAD3, SMAD2, and \\xc3\\xa1-SMA, TGF-\\xc3\\xa2, RI /II, P38, ERK, and NF-kB in renal tissues were determined. In vitro experiments analyzed the effect of enhanced TGF-\\xc3\\xa2 containing rat serums of the STZ groups on mesangial cells with and without transient transfection with a cytoglobin-containing plasmid.LDP treatment reduced the kidney coefficient, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine protein and prevented pathological changes. Expression of SOD and NOS in kidney tissue was increased but MDA expression reduced. LDP modulated multiple pathways, and its administration inhibited the phosphorylation of SMADS, ERK, p38, and the expression of NF-kB, \\xc3\\xa1-SMA, and TGF-\\xc3\\xa2 RI/II, and upregulated the expression of cytoglobin. In vitro studies revealed that overexpression of cytoglobin suppressed phosphorylation of Smad2, ERK, and p38 induced by TGF-\\xc3\\xa2 and expression of NF-kB, \\xc3\\xa1-SMA, and TGF-\\xc3\\xa2 RI.LDP prevented renal fibrosis and protected glomerular mesangial cells by upregulation of cytoglobin and suppression of multiple pathways involving TGF-\\xc3\\xa2/SMADS, MAPK, NF-kB signaling. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: The clinicopathological data of patients of renal cell carcinoma arising in end-stage renal disease were collected from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (ten cases) and 971 Hospital of PLA Navy (five cases) from January 2009 to August 2018. Results: Among 15 patients, 14 were male and 1 was female, and the age ranged from 38 to 78 years (mean 51 years, median 49 years). All patients had history of chronic renal failure (7-192 months), including 9 patients treated with hemodialysis for 6 to 132 months. In 12 cases the tumor border was distinct and the tumor size ranged from 1.8 to 11.0 cm. Two cases were multifocal and one case showed extensive renal hemorrhage with an inconspicuous tumor mass. Microscopically, 9 cases were clear cell reanl cell carcinoma including one with sarcomatoid differentiation, 4 were acquired cystic kidney disease-associated(ACKD-RCC) and two were papillary renal cell carcinoma. All patients had a follow-up of 3 to 120 months. Four patients died during a follow-up of 6 to 60 months (mean 30 months) as a result of extensive distant metastases (two cases) and renal failure (two cases), while other eleven patients were alive without tumor recurrence or metastasis (median 40.8 months of follow-up ranging from 3 to 120 months). Conclusions: ESRD-RCC is more often seen in younger male patients. The time intervals from the onset of chronic renal failure to the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma differ and tumors are frequently incidental findings. The histological types can be sporadic renal cell carcinoma or unique ACKD-RCC. Tumors are often hemorrhagic and necrotic. Routine physical examination and early detection could benefit ESRD-RCC patients. ESRD-RCC may have a favorable prognosis despite of a large tumor size or the presence of sarcomatoid differentiation. labels: #Adult#Aged#Carcinoma, Renal Cell#Female#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Kidney Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Nephrectomy#Prognosis'
b'Hyperproliferative keratinocytes induced by trauma, hyperkeratosis and/or inflammation display molecular signatures similar to those of palmoplantar epidermis. Inherited gain-of-function mutations in RHBDF2 (encoding iRHOM2) are associated with a hyperproliferative palmoplantar keratoderma and squamous oesophageal cancer syndrome (termed TOC). In contrast, genetic ablation of rhbdf2 in mice leads to a thinning of the mammalian footpad, and reduces keratinocyte hyperproliferation and migration. Here, we report that iRHOM2 is a novel target gene of p63 and that both p63 and iRHOM2 differentially regulate cellular stress-associated signalling pathways in normal and hyperproliferative keratinocytes. We demonstrate that p63-iRHOM2 regulates cell survival and response to oxidative stress via modulation of SURVIVIN and Cytoglobin, respectively. Furthermore, the antioxidant compound Sulforaphane downregulates p63-iRHOM2 expression, leading to reduced proliferation, inflammation, survival and ROS production. These findings elucidate a novel p63-associated pathway that identifies iRHOM2 modulation as a potential therapeutic target to treat hyperproliferative skin disease and neoplasia. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'During August 9-October 31, 2019, 96 patients were classified as having e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH); other patients are being investigated for case classification and exposures. Among 58 patients interviewed, 53 (91%) reported obtaining tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products from informal sources such as friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), the MDH Public Health Laboratory (PHL) analyzed 46 THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from 12 EVALI patients for various potential toxicants, including vitamin E acetate, which has recently been detected in some THC-containing products and in samples of lung fluid from EVALI patients (1-4). To explore whether vitamin E acetate is a recently added component in THC-containing products, MDH tested ten products seized by law enforcement in 2018, before the EVALI outbreak, and 20 products seized in 2019, during the outbreak. Twenty-four products obtained from 11 EVALI patients from 2019 contained vitamin E acetate. Among the seized products tested by MDH, none seized in 2018 contained vitamin E acetate, although all tested THC-containing products seized in 2019 tested positive for vitamin E acetate. These chemical analyses of products obtained from EVALI patients and of products intended for the illicit market both before and during the outbreak support a potential role for vitamin E acetate in the EVALI outbreak; however, the number of products tested was small, and further research is needed to establish a causal link between exposure to inhaled vitamin E acetate and EVALI. Collaboration between public health jurisdictions and law enforcement to characterize THC-containing products circulating before the recognition of the EVALI outbreak and during the outbreak might provide valuable information about a dynamic market. These Minnesota findings highlight concerns about e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC acquired from informal sources. Because local supply chains and policy environments vary, CDC continues to recommend not using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC or any e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from informal sources. E-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or pregnant women.* Until the relationship between inhaled vitamin E acetate and lung health is better characterized, vitamin E acetate should not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping, products. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Dronabinol#Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems#Female#Humans#Law Enforcement#Legislation, Drug#Lung Injury#Male#Middle Aged#Minnesota#Vaping#Vitamin E#Young Adult'
b"Public parks are leisure environments widely used by both, adults and children, often accompained by their pets. Soil contamination of these environments by enteric viruses and intestinal parasites occurs through these animals feces. The aim of this work was to detect Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPV-1) and different species of Mastadenovirus in soils samples from a park located in a medium-sized city in Brazil and evaluate the presence of helminth eggs and larvae in 18 points of a public park soil samples, as well as feces found on this site during six months. Parasitological analyzes were conducted through flotation and sedimentation techniques, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for viral detection. Of the 216 soil and 16 feces samples, 49% (106/216) and 12% (2/16) were positivefor nematodes larvae, respectively, through sedimentation techniques. Toxocara spp eggs were found in one soil sample and one feces sample, Trichuris spp eggs were found in only one feces sample and Hookworms eggs were found in four soil samples. After reconstruction work in the streets near the park, 30% (64/216) of the samples were positive for Human Mastadenovirus C (HAdV-C), 1.4% (3/216) for HAdV-E and 0.4% (1/216) for Canine Mastadenovirus A (CAdV-A). The parasitic forms found in this study have demonstrated that the contamination of the park's soil pose a threat to human and animal health. This was the first study to report the presence of HAdVs and CAdVs in soil samples. labels: #Ancylostomatoidea#Animals#Dogs#Feces#Humans#Mastadenovirus#Parks, Recreational#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Soil#Soil Microbiology#Toxocara"
b'Southern right whales Eubalaena australis (SRWs) migrate to southern Brazil for breeding and calving from June through November. Overall, there is scarce knowledge on health status and pathologic conditions in SRWs. We report the pathologic and molecular investigation results of 8 SRWs that were necropsied between 2010 and 2017 within a breeding and calving ground in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The animals were of various ages (7 newborns/calves, 1 adult) and sex (3 females, 5 males). Five whales stranded dead; 3 stranded alive and died shortly after (n = 2) or were euthanized (n = 1). The causes of stranding and/or death were neonatal respiratory distress syndrome with meconium aspiration (n = 3) with concomitant congenital hepatopathy in one of them; trauma of unknown origin (n = 3), infectious renal and lung disease with presumed sepsis (n = 1), and euthanasia (n = 1). Three animals were PCR-positive for cetacean morbillivirus; one of them also had morbilliviral antigen in kidney via immunohistochemical analysis. These results, integrating novel findings and a published report, contribute to the pathology knowledge of this species. labels: #Animals#Brazil#Cause of Death#Communicable Diseases#Female#Male#Meconium Aspiration Syndrome#Whales'
b"Cytoglobin (Cygb) is a hexa-coordinated hemoprotein with yet to be defined physiological functions. The iron coordination and spin state of the Cygb heme group are sensitive to oxidation of two cysteine residues (Cys38/Cys83) and/or the binding of free fatty acids. However, the roles of redox vs lipid regulators of Cygb's structural rearrangements in the context of the protein peroxidase competence are not known. Searching for physiologically relevant lipid regulators of Cygb, here we report that anionic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositolphosphates, affect structural organization of the protein and modulate its iron state and peroxidase activity both conjointly and/or independently of cysteine oxidation. Thus, different anionic lipids can operate in cysteine-dependent and cysteine-independent ways as inducers of the peroxidase activity. We establish that Cygb's peroxidase activity can be utilized for the catalysis of peroxidation of anionic phospholipids (including phosphatidylinositolphosphates) yielding mono-oxygenated molecular species. Combined with the computational simulations we propose a bipartite lipid binding model that rationalizes the modes of interactions with phospholipids, the effects on structural re-arrangements and the peroxidase activity of the hemoprotein.  labels: #Cytoglobin"
b'CME: Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis Abstract. While tuberculosis mostly manifests as pulmonary infection, a dissemination in any extrapulmonary organ is possible. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mostly affects lymph nodes, pleura and bones. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as an HIV co-infection or immunosuppressive therapies like TNF-alpha-inhibitors have a higher risk of a dissemination of tuberculosis. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is difficult, as microbiological testing mostly requires invasive procedures to obtain a sample for direct proof of tuberculosis by microscopy, culture, molecular methods (e.g. Xpert\\xc2\\xae MTB/RIF) or histology. Treatment follows guidelines of pulmonary tuberculosis with a two-month regimen consisting of four drugs (rifampicin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide and ethambuthol), followed by a four-month therapy with two drugs (rifampicin and isoniazide). Duration of therapy is extended in tuberculous meningitis to one year and in a skeletal dissemination up to six to nine months. Corticosteroids are recommended in cerebral and pericardial tuberculosis. labels: #Antibiotics, Antitubercular#Humans#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Rifampin#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tuberculosis'
b'Objective: To explore the limb salvage strategies for patients with high voltage electric burns of extremities on the verge of amputation. Methods: From January 2003 to March 2019, 61 patients with high voltage electric burns of extremities on the verge of amputation were treated in our hospital. All of them were male, aged 15-58 years, including 49 cases of upper limbs and 12 cases of lower limbs. The wound area after thorough debridement ranged from 15 cm?11 cm to 35 cm?20 cm. Emergency surgery for reconstruction of the radial artery with saphenous vein graft under eschar was performed in 5 cases. The arteries of 36 patients (including 7 cases with simultaneous ulnar artery and radial artery reconstruction) were reconstructed with various forms of blood flow-through after debridement, among them, the radial artery of 13 cases, the ulnar artery of 8 cases, the brachial artery of 8 cases, and the femoral artery of 2 cases were reconstructed with saphenous vein graft; the radial artery of 3 cases and the ulnar artery of 7 cases were reconstructed with the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery graft; the radial artery of 2 cases were reconstructed with greater omentum vascular graft; the reflux vein of 3 cases with wrist and forearm annular electric burns were reconstructed with saphenous vein graft. According to the actual situation of the patients, 12 cases of latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, 6 cases of paraumbilical flap, 28 cases of anterolateral thigh flap, 10 cases of abdominal combined axial flap, 5 cases of greater omentum combined with flap and/or skin grafts were used to repair the wounds after debridement and cover the main wounds as much as possible. Some cases were filled with muscle flap in deep defect at the same time. The area of tissue flaps ranged from 10 cm?10 cm to 38 cm?22 cm. For particularly large wounds and annular wounds, the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, the paraumbilical flap, the abdominal combined axial flap, and the greater omentum combined with flap and/or skin grafts were used more often. Donor sites of three patients were closed directly, and those of 58 patients were repaired with thin and medium split-thickness skin or mesh skin grafts. The outcome of limb salvage, flap survival, and follow-up of patients in this group were recorded. Results: All the transplanted tissue flaps survived in 61 patients. Fifty-six patients had successful limb salvage, among them, 31 limbs were healed after primary surgery; 20 limbs with flap infection and tissue necrosis survived after debridement and flap sutured in situ; 5 limbs with flap infection, radial artery thrombosis, and hand blood supply crisis survived after debridement and radial artery reconstruction with saphenous vein graft. Five patients had limb salvage failure, among them, 3 patients with wrist electric burns had embolism on the distal end of the transplanted blood vessels, without condition of re-anastomosis, and the hands gradually necrotized; although the upper limb of one patient was salvaged at first, due to the extensive necrosis and infection at the distal radius and ulna and the existence of hand blood supply under flap, considering prognostic function and economic benefits, amputation was required by the patient; although the foot of one patient was salvaged at first, due to the repeated infection, sinus formation, extensive bone necrosis of foot under flap, dullness of sole and dysfunction in walking for a long time, amputation was required by the patient. During the follow-up of 6 months to 5 years, 56 patients had adequate blood supply in the salvaged limbs, satisfied appearance of flaps, and certain recovery of limb function. Conclusions: Timely revascularization, early thorough debridement, and transplantation of large free tissue flap, combined tissue flap, or blood flow-through flap with rich blood supply are the basic factors to get better limb preservation and recovery of certain functions for patients with high voltage electric burns of limbs on the verge of amputation. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Amputation#Burns, Electric#Humans#Limb Salvage#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Treatment Outcome#Wound Healing#Young Adult'
b'Radiation-induced bowel injury is a common complication of radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy. Given the huge number of patients diagnosed with pelvic malignancy, the number of patients diagnosed with radiation-induced bowel injury increased year by year, which put a great burden on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of radiation-induced bowel injury. In particular, chronic radiation-induced bowel injury, which is manifested in the process of prolonged, repeated and progressive aggravation, seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients and makes clinical diagnosis and treatment difficult. However, due to insufficient attention and understanding from doctors and patients, standardized diagnosis and treatment of radiation-induced bowel injury still have a long way to go. Radiation-induced bowel injury is self-limited but irreversible. During diagnosis, we should pay attention to overall evaluation of the stage of disease based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic examination, imaging examination, pathology and nutritional risk. The treatment methods include health education, drug therapy, enema therapy, formalin local treatment, endoscopic treatment and surgical treatment, etc. The treatment decision-making should be based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic or imaging findings to alleviate the clinical symptoms of patients as the primary goal and to improve the long-term quality of life of patients as the ultimate goal. labels: #Chronic Disease#Humans#Intestinal Diseases#Intestines#Pelvic Neoplasms#Quality of Life#Radiation Injuries#Radiotherapy'
b'Objective: To investigate the effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) knockdown on proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and explore the mechanism. Methods: The expression levels of HO-1 mRNA in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H358 and H1993) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression level of HO-1 in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens. The HO-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was transfected into A549 cells by RNA interference technique. HO-1 stably deleted A549 cells were selected (HO-1 shRNA group) and verified by RT-qPCR and western blot. HO-1 shRNA A549 cells and control shRNA A549 cells were treated with the inducer of autophagy Torin1 or its inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), respectively. The expressions of autophagic markers LC3B and p62 were determined by western blot. The proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of each group of A549 cells were assessed by cell counting, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. Results: The expressions of HO-1 mRNA in lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H358 and H1993) were significantly higher than that of HBECs, and HO-1 upregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of p62 protein and the ratio of LC3B-?/ LC3B-? in no treatment group, Torin1 treatment group and Baf A1 treatment group were significantly higher than those of the corresponding control group (P<0.05). After 11 days of culture, the number of cells in HO-1 shRNA group were 41.8%, 30.4% and 14.0% of the corresponding control group, respectively. The number of lower chamber cells in HO-1 shRNA group were (35.7\\xc2\\xb12.1), (27.0\\xc2\\xb11.0) and (38.0\\xc2\\xb11.0)/field, respectively, which were lower than (66.0\\xc2\\xb19.2), (39.3\\xc2\\xb11.2) and (43.0\\xc2\\xb12.6)/field of the corresponding control group, respectively (P<0.05). The migration distances of HO-1 shRNA group were (7.47\\xc2\\xb10.91) mm, (4.23\\xc2\\xb10.82) mm and (5.42\\xc2\\xb10.24) mm, which were lower than (10.07\\xc2\\xb11.26) mm, (7.14\\xc2\\xb10.07) mm and (12.04\\xc2\\xb10.80) mm of the corresponding control groups, respectively (P<0.05). Conclusion: Knockdown of HO-1 inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of A549 cells by impeding autophagy. labels: #A549 Cells#Adenocarcinoma of Lung#Autophagy#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Gene Knockdown Techniques#Heme Oxygenase-1#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Neoplasm Invasiveness#RNA, Small Interfering'
b'Objective: To explore the resistance mechanism and gene type of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn care unit. Methods: A total of 27 CRKP strains were primarily isolated from 22 patients [20 males, 2 females, aged (42\\xc2\\xb116) years] admitted to burn care unit of Institute of Burn Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University, hereinafter referred to as our department) from January to December 2017. After identification of bacteria, the months of detection and distribution of sample source were analyzed. Drug resistance tests of 15 antibiotics were conducted. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the drug resistant genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used to analyze the gene type of strains. Results: (1) During the whole year of 2017, CRKP strains were mostly detected in August (8 strains), September (6 strains), and October (5 strains), with no CRKP in January, March, June, November, and December. Five strains from bed units were detected in August (2 strains), September (1 strain), and October (2 strains). (2) Twenty-seven CRKP strains were derived from blood samples (40.7%, 11/27), wound exudate samples (18.5%, 5/27), deep vein catheter samples (11.1%, 3/27), sputum samples (7.4%, 2/27), urine samples (3.7%, 1/27), and bed unit samples (18.5%, 5/27). (3) The 27 CRKP strains were detected with drug-resistance rates of 100.0% to 7 antibiotics including cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ertapenem, and compound sulfamethoxazole, no drug-resistance to tigecycline, with drug-resistance rates higher than 81.0% to the rest 7 antibiotics. (4) Detection rates for resistance gene bla(CTX-M-10), bla(SHV), bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(ACT), and bla(KPC) were all above 92.5%. (5) According to PFGE, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 types (A, A(1), A(2), B, C, and D). Strains of type A were mainly detected in February, May, and September, with detection rate of 37.0% (10/27). Strains of type C were mainly detected in July, August, and October, with detection rate of 48.1% (13/27). Strains of types A(1), A(2), B, and D were scatteredly detected, with detection rate of 3.7% (1/27) respectively. According to MLST, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 STs. ST11 was the most frequent type, accounting for 74.1% (20/27), which was detected in August to October. The detection rate of ST395, ST2230, ST215, ST260, and STnew ranged from 3.7%(1/27) to 7.4%(2/27), and the strains were scatteredly detected. Conclusions: The main source of CRKP from burn care unit of our department was bloodstream. All the CRKP strains showed high drug-resistance rate and complicated resistance mechanism. There were small scale outbreaks caused by CRKP of type A, type C, and ST11, which should be paid more attention to in clinical treatment and infection control. labels: #Adult#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Burn Units#Burns#Carbapenems#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Female#Humans#Klebsiella Infections#Klebsiella pneumoniae#Male#Microbial Sensitivity Tests#Middle Aged#Multilocus Sequence Typing#beta-Lactamases'
b'Low temperature frequently influences growth, development, and even survival of aquatic animals. In the present study, physiological and molecular responses to low temperature in Litopenaeus vannamei were investigated. The cDNA sequences of two oxygen-carrying proteins, cytoglobin (Cygb) and neuroglobin (Ngb), were isolated. Protein structure analysis revealed that both proteins share a globin superfamily domain. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that Cygb and Ngb mRNA levels gradually increased during decrease in temperatures from 25 to 15\\xc2\\xb0C and then decreased at 10\\xc2\\xb0C in muscle, brain, stomach, and heart, except for a continuing increase in gills, whereas they showed a different expression trend in the hepatopancreas. Hemocyanin concentration gradually reduced as the temperature decreased. Moreover, the activities of respiratory metabolic enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were measured, and it was found that LDH activity gradually increased while SDH activity decreased after low-temperature treatment. Finally, damage to gill structure at low temperature was also observed, and this intensified with further decrease in temperature. Taken together, these results show that low temperature has an adverse influence in L. vannamei, which contributes to systematic understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of shrimp at low temperature. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b"OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and psychological predictors of OHRQoL.METHODS: Cross-sectional clinical and questionnaire study with 332 adolescents aged 11-14 years. The facial profile was classified through photographs and dental malocclusion was classified by the Dental Health Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. The psychosocial variables were assessed by the Aesthetic Component of IOTN, the Orthodontic Aesthetic Subjective Impact Score and the Global Negative Self-Evaluation. OHRQoL was measured using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression models.RESULTS: Higher aesthetic concern and low self-esteem were 3.43 and 3.34 times more likely to affect OHRQoL (p?0.05), respectively. The facial and dental aspects of malocclusion were unrelated to OHRQoL.CONCLUSIONS: Facial and dental aspects of malocclusion were unrelated to OHRQoL, whereas psychosocial variables such as self-perception of orthodontic treatment need and self-esteem predicted adolescents' oral health related quality of life. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Cross-Sectional Studies#Humans#Malocclusion#Oral Health#Quality of Life#Self Concept#Surveys and Questionnaires"
b'PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of implants inserted in maxillary sinuses augmented with 100% anorganic bovine bone (ABB) grafts versus mixed with 50% ABB and 50% autologous bone graft using a lateral window approach.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a randomised controlled trial of parallel groups. Patients in need of an implant-supported prosthesis in maxillary posterior areas, with a residual alveolar bone height ranging between 0 and 4 mm, were recruited for lateral sinus grafting and implant placement. Patients were randomly allocated to receive two different graft materials according to a parallel group design: group A was grafted with 50% ABB and 50% autogenous bone; group B was grafted with 100% ABB. After 7 months, tapered implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 20 and 45 Ncm. Three months later implants were loaded with screw-retained temporary crowns. Definitive crowns were delivered after 3 months. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis survival rates, complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, probing pocket depths (PPDs) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Clinical data were collected at definitive prosthesis delivery, and 1, 2 and 5 years after definitive loading.RESULTS: Thirty-two consecutive patients were treated with 32 sinus elevation procedures (16 group A, 16 group B). A total of 46 implants were inserted. One patient (with two implants) dropped out in group A, and two patients (with three implants) dropped out in group B. No implant/crown failed by the end of the study. Three complications (one sinus membrane perforation and two chipping of the ceramic) were observed in three patients in group A, versus none in group B (relative risk was 0.81; 95% CI 0.64-1.03; P = 0.225). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean marginal bone loss was 1.18 \\xc2\\xb1 0.50 mm (95% CI 0.95-1.45 mm) in group A and 1.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 0.97-1.43 mm) in group B, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups (difference 0.11 \\xc2\\xb1 0.22 mm; 95% CI -0.06-0.16 mm; P = 0.586). At the 5-year follow-up, the mean marginal bone loss was 1.37 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 1.13-1.86 mm) in group A and 1.42 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 1.17-1.90 mm) in group B (difference 0.15 \\xc2\\xb1 0.08 mm; 95% CI 0.10-0.22 mm; P = 0.426). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean PPD value was 2.70 \\xc2\\xb1 0.39 mm for group A and 2.54 \\xc2\\xb1 0.66 mm for group B, with no statistically significant difference between groups (difference 0.17 \\xc2\\xb1 0.39 mm; 95% CI 0.06-0.32 mm; P = 0.456). At the 5-year follow-up, the mean PPD value was 3.20 \\xc2\\xb1 0.44 mm for group A and 3.32 \\xc2\\xb1 0.49 mm for group B (difference 0.12 \\xc2\\xb1 0.43 mm; 95% CI 0.02-0.22 mm; P = 0.672). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean BOP value was 1.21 \\xc2\\xb1 0.79 for group A and 1.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.68 for group B (difference 0.06 \\xc2\\xb1 0.49; 95% CI -0.23-0.25; P = 0.297), and at the 5-year follow-up, the mean BOP value was 1.77 \\xc2\\xb1 0.62 for group A and 1.91 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 for group B (difference: 0.14 \\xc2\\xb1 0.51; 95% CI -0.05-0.33; P = 0.492).CONCLUSIONS: Within thelimitations of this study, the present data confirm similar clinical outcomes of implants inserted in sinuses grafted with ABB versus implants inserted in sinuses grafted with mixed 50% ABB and 50% autologous bone. labels: #Animals#Bone Transplantation#Cattle#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis Design#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Humans#Maxillary Sinus'
b'At the beginning of 2009, the 38th principle of the Administrative Measures for Clinical Application of Medical Technology, issued by the former Ministry of Health, clearly pointed out that medical institutions should establish a hierarchical management system for surgery. Then the Trial of Administrative Measures for Surgical Classification of Medical Institutions was published and implemented in 2012, but the official introduction of surgical classification catalogue in the national level has not been seen. Therefore, the writing group of this expert consensus has organized numerous well-known experts and scholars in China, taking the three elements of the 38th principle of the Administrative Measures for Clinical Application of Medical Technology issued by the Ministry of Health--risk coefficient, complexity, and technical difficulty as the basic norm to grade scientifically through the four indicators of burn index, surgical area, surgical repair method, and anesthesia risk (each indicator with 4 grades and scores). The total score is then accumulated to divide four grades of operations. The Expert Consensus on Classification Evaluation Methods of Burn Surgery in China (2019 Version) is strategized together expecting to provide academic reference for the government departments to issue or further improve and perfect surgical classification catalogue in the national level as soon as possible, and lay a foundation for the stable development of burn discipline with the significance of national strategic reserve. labels: #Burns#China#Consensus#Humans#Practice Guidelines as Topic'
b"Objective: To explore the effect of tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall in emergency treatment of laryngeal edema in patients with burns. Methods: From November 2000 to August 2018, 22 patients with severe burn or extremely severe burn combined with acute laryngeal edema were rescued in the author's unit, including 18 males and 4 females, aged 17 to 68 years. All patients were complicated with mild inhalation injury or above and more than deep partial-thickness burn to head, face, and neck. From November 2000 to October 2012, simple emergency tracheotomy was performed for 12 cases. From May 2013 to August 2018, tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall was performed for 10 cases. Rescue effect and complication of the two kinds of tracheotomy were recorded. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test. Results: Among the 12 patients treated with simple emergency tracheotomy, 5 cases survived and 7 cases died of suffocation during tracheotomy. Among the 10 patients treated with tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall, 9 cases survived and 1 case died of cardiac arrest caused by arrhythmia. There was statistically significant difference in successful rescue effect between the two kinds of tracheotomy (P<0.05). Among the 14 patients who were successfully rescued, symptoms of insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder occurred in 12 cases, which were relieved after symptomatic treatment for 14 to 45 d without permanent hypoxic brain damage. Conclusions: In case of loss of the condition of preventive tracheotomy, first aid of acute laryngeal edema of burn patient is very difficult. Tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall is simple and rapid with high successful rate and amelioration of hypoxia, which is an ideal plan for laryngeal edema. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Airway Obstruction#Burns#Emergency Treatment#Female#Humans#Laryngeal Edema#Male#Middle Aged#Punctures#Tracheotomy#Young Adult"
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) serum on expression of myogenic differentiation antigen (Myod) and autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 in cultured muscle satellite cells of rats under starvation conditions.METHODS: The primary multifidus muscle satellite cells of one male SD rat were isolated and cultured to obtain the 3rd generation of cells. The EA serum was got from the rat received EA stimulation of bilateral "Weizhong" (BL40, 2 Hz/10 Hz, 1 mA, duration of 20 min, once daily for 7 days). The cell suspension (2?104/well) of the 3rd generation of cultured cells was transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Twelve duplicate wells were set up for the blank control serum (without FBS), 10% FBS, 10% EA serum, 20% EA serum and 30% EA serum groups and incubated for 12 h and 24 h, respectively. Each well was supplemented with 10 \\xc2\\xb5L CCK-8 reagent to be incubated for 1 h again for observing the state of cell proliferation. After culturing the primary muscle satellite cells in serum-free medium for 12 h, the cells were randomly divided into serum-free group, 10% fetal bovine serum group and optimal concentration electroacupuncture serum group, and serum of corresponding concentration was added respectively. The expression levels of Beclin 1 and cell-proliferation-related protein Myod were detected by Western blot.RESULTS: CCK-8 assay displayed that the proliferation levels were significantly higher at 12 h and 24 h after serum intervention in the 10% FBS, 10% EA serum, 20% EA serum and 30% EA serum groups than that in the blank control serum group (P<0.01), and at 24 h in the 3 EA serum groups than in the 10% FBS group (P<0.01), but without significant difference among the three EA serum groups (P>0.05). As a result, 10% EA serum was selected as the optimal concentration for Western blot tests. No significant difference was found in the expression levels of Myod and Beclin 1 proteins among the serum-free, 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups before intervention (P>0.05), and there was a marked up-regulation of Myod expression and an obvious down-regulation of Beclin 1 expression at 12 h in both the 10% EA serum and 10% FBS groups in comparison with their own pre-intervention (P<0.05). There were a marked up-re-gulation of Myod expression at both 12 h and 24 h and Beclin 1 expression at 24 h in both the 10% EA serum group and 10% FBS group than that in the serum-free group (P<0.05), and an obvious down-regulation of Beclin 1 expression at 12 h in both 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups than that in the serum-free group (P<0.05, P<0.01). After 24 h\\\'s serum intervention, there was an increase of Myod expression and a reduction of Beclin 1 expression in both 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups compared with those after the 12 h intervention (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups in the expression levels of Myod and Beclin 1 proteins (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: EA serum can promote proliferation of cultured muscle satellite cells under starvation conditions, which is related to its functions in regulating expression of Beclin 1 and cell-proliferation-related protein Myod. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Animals#Antigens, Differentiation#Beclin-1#Electroacupuncture#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Large Intestine of Hand-Yangming, Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming and the Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, so as to explore the positive reaction points at the body surface of allergic rhinitis.METHODS: Thirty variant rhinitis volunteer subjects and 30 healthy subjects were recruited in the present study. The subcutaneous induration, reaction points of emptiness-like feeling or pressing pain below the elbow- and knee-joints along the Large Intestine Meridian, Stomach Meridian and the Lung Meridian were inspected first, then re-examined by using heat-sensitized moxibustion method and a hand-held pain threshold tester (mechanical pressure), respectively. The frequency and coincidence rate of pressing-pain sensitive and heat-sensitive points were analyzed.RESULTS: In the 30 patients with allergic rhinitis, 10 positive reaction points as Kongzui (LU6), Chize (LU5), Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Shousanli(LI10), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Fenglong (ST40), Xiajuxu (ST39), and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian were found. Among them, the duration of heat-sensitive reaction in the LU6, LI10, ST37, ST40, and ST39 regions was obviously shorter in patients than in healthy subjects (P<0.01,P<0.005). The heat-sensitive forms of the positive reaction points were mainly heat transmission, heat-penetration and local reaction. The mechanical pain thresholds of the positive reaction points (LI4, LU6, LI10, LI11 and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian) at the upper limbs and those (ST36, ST37 and ST40) at the lower limbs were evidently lower in patients than in healthy volunteer subjects (P<0.05). The pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints were basically coincide in the patients, but being higher in patients than in healthy subjects in the frequency of occurrence. The mechanical pain threshold of the pressure-sensitive acupoints in patients was remarkably lower on the left side than on the right side of the upper limb, and obviously higher on the left side than on the right side of the lower limb (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the right and left sides in the pain threshold in healthy subjects (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: There is a high overlap in the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Lung, Large Intestine and Stomach meridians below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, and there is an imbalance between the left and right limbs in the mechanical pain threshold of the pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints, but needing being further confirmed. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Hot Temperature#Humans#Meridians#Moxibustion#Rhinitis, Allergic'
b"BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus follows the classic step-wise progression of metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma. While Barrett's esophagus is a leading known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, the pathogenesis of this disease sequence is poorly understood. Mitochondria are highly susceptible to mutations due to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled with low levels of DNA repair. The timing and levels of mitochondria instability and dysfunction across the Barrett's disease progression is under studied.METHODS: Using an in-vitro model representing the Barrett's esophagus disease sequence of normal squamous epithelium (HET1A), metaplasia (QH), dysplasia (Go), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (OE33), random mitochondrial mutations, deletions and surrogate markers of mitochondrial function were assessed. In-vivo and ex-vivo tissues were also assessed for instability profiles.RESULTS: Barrett's metaplastic cells demonstrated increased levels of ROS (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.005) and increased levels of random mitochondrial mutations (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.05) compared with all other stages of the Barrett's disease sequence in-vitro. Using patient in-vivo samples, Barrett's metaplasia tissue demonstrated significantly increased levels of random mitochondrial deletions (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.043) compared with esophageal adenocarcinoma tissue, along with increased expression of cytoglobin (CYGB) (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.05), a gene linked to oxidative stress, compared with all other points across the disease sequence. Using ex-vivo Barrett's metaplastic and matched normal patient tissue explants, higher levels of cytochrome c (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.003), SMAC/Diablo (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.008) and four inflammatory cytokines (all p values <0.05) were secreted from Barrett's metaplastic tissue compared with matched normal squamous epithelium.CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that increased mitochondrial instability and markers of cellular and mitochondrial stress are early events in the Barrett's disease sequence. labels: #Cytoglobin"
b'The present study aimed to investigate the safety and short-term outcome of laparoscopy-assisted distal radical gastrectomy in treating gastric cancer among obese patients.Perioperative outcomes were compared between 67 gastric cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) ?25\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m (obese group) and 198 ones with BMI <25\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m (non-obese group). All the cases underwent laparoscopic radical resection between April 2009 and October 2013.The value of BMI was 27.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.67\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m in the obese group and 21.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.64\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m in non-obese group. There were no significant differences between 2 groups in age, sex, presence of diabetes, tumor size, number of metastatic lymph nodes, or metastatic lymph node ratio. Postoperative complications did not differ between the 2 groups (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). There were significant differences between the 2 groups in operation time (non-obese: [234.2\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a67.1]\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes vs obese group: [259.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a78.5]; P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.017), postoperative hospital stay (obese group [19.7\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a14.8] day vs non-obese [15.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a7.1], P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002), and retrieved lymph nodes ([27.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a11.0] day vs non-obese [31.9\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a12.5] day, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002).Obesity may prolong operation time and postoperative hospital stay, and cause less retrieved lymph nodes, but does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications.

b"Objective: To investigate the diagnosis and treatment for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) in China, and to explore the prognostic factors of ECF. Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted based on the Registration System of Chinese Gastrointestinal Fistula and Intra-Abdominal Infections to collect the clinical data of ECF patients from 54 medical centers in 22 provinces/municipalities from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The clinical data included patient gender, age, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, underlying diseases, primary diseases, direct causes of ECF, location and type of ECF, complications, treatment and outcomes. All medical records were carefully filled in by the attending physicians, and then re-examined by more than two specialists. The diagnosis of ECF was based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory/imaging findings and intraoperative exploration. Results: A total of 1521 patients with ECF were enrolled, including 1099 males and 422 females, with a median age of 55 years. The top three primary diseases of ECF were malignant tumors in 626 cases (41.2%, including 540 gastrointestinal tumors, accounting for 86.3% of malignant tumors), gastrointestinal ulcers and perforations in 202 cases (13.3%), and trauma in 157 cases (10.3%). The direct causes of ECF were mainly surgical operation in 1194 cases (78.5%), followed by trauma in 156 (10.3%), spontaneous fistula due to Crohn's disease in 92 (6.0%), radiation intestinal injury in 41 (2.7%), severe pancreatitis in 20 (1.3%), endoscopic treatment in 13 (0.9%) and 5 cases (0.3%) of unknown reasons. All the patients were divided into three groups: 1350 cases (88.7%) with simple ECF, 150 (9.9%) with multiple ECF, and 21 (1.4%) with combined internal fistula. Among the patients with simple ECF, 438 cases (28.8%) were jejuno-ileal fistula, 313 (20.6%) colon fistula, 170 (11.2%) rectal fistula, 111 (7.3%) duodenal fistula, 76 (5.0%) ileocecal fistula, 65 (4.3%) ileocolic anastomotic fistula, 55 (3.6%) duodenal stump fistula, 36 (2.4%) gastrointestinal anastomotic fistula, 36 (2.4%) esophagogastric/esophagojejunal anastomotic fistula, 29 (1.9%) gastric fistula and 21 (1.4%) cholangiopancreatiointestinal. Among all the simple ECF patients, 991 were tubular fistula and 359 were labial fistula. A total of 1146 patients finished the treatment, of whom 1061 (92.6%) were healed (586 by surgery and 475 self-healing) and 85 (7.4%) died. A total of 1043 patients (91.0%) received nutritional support therapy, and 77 (6.7%) received fistuloclysis. Infectious source control procedures were applied to 1042 patients, including 711 (62.0%) with active lavage and drainage and 331 (28.9%) with passive drainage. Among them, 841 patients (73.4%) underwent minimally invasive procedures of infectious source control (replacement of drainage tube through sinus tract, puncture drainage, etc.), 201 (17.5%) underwent laparotomy drainage, while 104 (9.1%) did not undergo any drainage measures. A total of 610 patients (53.2%) received definitive operation, 24 patients died within postoperative 30-day with mortality of 3.9% (24/610), 69 (11.3%) developed surgical site infection (SSI), and 24 (3.9%) had a relapse of fistula. The highest cure rate was achieved in ileocecal fistula (100%), followed by rectal fistula (96.2%, 128/133) and duodenal stump fistula (95.7%,44/46). The highest mortality was found in combined internal fistula (3/12) and no death in ileocecal fistula. Univariate prognostic analysis showed that primary diseases as Crohn's disease (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=6.570, P=0.010) and appendicitis/appendiceal abscess (P=0.012), intestinal fistula combining with internal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=5.460, P=0.019), multiple ECF (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=7.135, P=0.008), esophagogastric / esophagojejunal anastomotic fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.501, P=0.002), ECF at ileocecal junction (P=0.012), non-drainage/passive drainage before the diagnosis of intestinal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.688, P=0.008), non-drainage/passive drainage after the diagnosis of intestinal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.711, P=0.008), complicating with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=179.699, P<0.001), sepsis (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=211.851, P<0.001), hemorrhage (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=85.300, P<0.001), pulmonary infection (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=60.096, P<0.001), catheter-associated infection (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=10.617, P=0.001) and malnutrition (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=21.199, P<0.001) were associated with mortality. Multivariate prognostic analysis cofirmed that sepsis (OR=7.103, 95%CI:3.694-13.657, P<0.001), complicating with MODS (OR=5.018, 95%CI:2.170-11.604, P<0.001), and hemorrhage (OR=4.703, 95%CI: 2.300-9.618, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of the death for ECF patients. Meanwhile, active lavage and drainage after the definite ECF diagnosis was the protective factor (OR=0.223, 95%CI: 0.067-0.745, P=0.015). Conclusions: The overall mortality of ECF is still high. Surgical operation is the most common cause of ECF. Complications e.g. sepsis, MODS, hemorrhage, and catheter-associated infection, are the main causes of death. Active lavage and drainage is important to improve the prognosis of ECF. labels: #China#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intestinal Fistula#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Prospective Studies#Risk Factors"
b'PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of immediate versus conventional delayed loading of four dental implants in edentulous mandibles with fixed prostheses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A blinded, two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial was conducted. A total of 42 patients were included, and each received four Br?nemark System implants with a TiUnite surface. The patients were randomly assigned to two study arms: 1) immediate-loading arm (IL), in which the mandibular denture was converted into an interim implant-supported fixed prosthesis (ISFP) on the day of surgery, with a permanent ISFP being inserted at least 3 months postsurgery; 2) conventional-loading arm (CL), in which the mandibular removable prosthesis was relieved at the implant site and relined with a soft tissue conditioner. Only implants with a minimum insertion torque of ? 35 Ncm were included in the IL group. Implants were loaded 4 to 6 months postsurgery. Independent, blind investigators assessed the patients at 2, 6 and 12 months and at 10 years. The outcome measures were prosthesis and implant success rates, type and frequency of complications and changes in peri-implant marginal bone levels.RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were allocated to the IL group and 22 to the CL group. However, one patient from the IL arm was excluded and three patients were reallocated to the CL arm. Two implants in one patient and one in another patient could not be placed with a ? 35 Ncm insertion torque, and a third patient developed severe sudden gag reflex and thus it was not possible to load the implants immediately. At a later stage, one of the patients who failed the initial stability test dropped out of the study. Therefore, initially, 24 patients were conventionally loaded and 16 patients were immediately loaded. At the 10-year follow-up, six patients dropped out from the IL arm and two from the CL arm. Also, at the 10-year-follow-up, the CL and IL study arms consisted of 22 and 10 participants, respectively, using the per-protocol (PP) analysis. Six implants failed in two patients of the CL arm (two implants in one patient and four implants in another patient), and three implants failed in three patients in the IL arm (PP analysis), respectively. The patient-level implant failure rate was 10% (intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis) and 14% (PP analysis) in the CL arm, and 25% (ITT) and 20% (PP) in the IL arm. The difference was not statistically significant (95% CI from -0.18 to 0.39, P = 0.65). The failure rate at the implant level was 8% (ITT) and 8% (PP) in the CL arm, and 6% (ITT) and 5% (PP) in the IL arm. The difference was not statistically significant (95% CI from -0.06 to 0.14, P = 0.44). Ten years after loading, patients in the IL arm lost an average of 0.55 \\xc2\\xb1 0.64 mm of peri-implant bone versus 0.41 \\xc2\\xb1 0.40 mm of peri-implant bone loss observed in the CL arm. The 10-year bone loss in both arms was statistically significant compared with the baseline (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two arms for peri-implant bone level changes (the difference between the arms was 0.14 mm \\xc2\\xb1 0.50 mm; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.52; P = 0.43). One prosthesis failed due to the loss of all four implants in one patient of the CL arm. Eight patients from the IL arm were affected by 13 complications (such as pain from fractures and inflammation) versus seven patients (10 complications) from the CL arm. The complication rate was 67% in the IL arm and 35% in the CL arm. The difference in complication proportions between the two arms was not statistically significant (difference in proportions = 0.32; 95% CI = -0.08 to 0.61; P = 0.14). All complications were managed successfully.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term data of immediate loading of four dental implants with a mandibular fixed prosthesis revealed comparable clinical outcomes to conventional loading. Therefore, immediate loading should be considered in the treatment of edentulous patients. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Humans#Immediate Dental Implant Loading#Mandible'
b'BACKGROUND: The ideal ablation strategy and end point for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) have not been well founded. Defining periprocedural AF termination as the end point of catheter ablation is still controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the differences between periprocedural AF termination and non-termination in the long-term AF recurrence rate and postoperative complications.METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a systematic search of electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library from January 2008 to August 2019. The primary outcome was freedom from AF or any atrial arrhythmia without antiarrhythmic drugs at the long-term (?12 months) follow-up. The secondary outcome was overall postoperative complication rates. The risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled for these outcomes. A forest plot, fixed-effects model or random-effect model, Q test, I statistic, and Egger funnel plot were used in the statistical analysis.RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant difference was found in freedom from AF at the long-term follow-up between patients in whom AF termination was achieved and not achieved (RR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.93, 95% CI\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.78-1.09, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.36, I\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a69%). Patients with AF non-termination had a lower complication occurrence rate than those with AF termination (RR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.74, 95% CI\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.11-2.73, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02, I\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0%).CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that AF termination is not a reliable procedural end point during ablation of persistent AF. labels: #Atrial Fibrillation#Catheter Ablation#Humans#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Treatment Outcome'
b'INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative seizures under general anesthesia are rare and our observation is the first to demonstrate a distinct electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern on the Narcotrend monitor.PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a 30-year-old man undergoing craniotomy for glioblastoma resection under general anesthesia who suffered tonic-clonic seizures captured in a specific pattern by the intraoperative EEG.DIAGNOSES: Our depth of anesthesia monitor recorded, before the seizure, a widening of the beta-wave performance in a distinct "triangular-shaped" pattern. This pattern was repeated before the second seizure. The patient had no previous history of seizures and following surgery no further seizures were recorded.INTERVENTIONS: A spectrogram analysis showed a distinct increase in mean absolute beta power immediately prior to the first seizure. The EEG immediately prior to the second seizure was characterized by broadband noise. Both seizures were characterized by increased mean absolute delta, theta, and beta power.OUTCOMES: The increase in EEG beta activity seen before the tonic-clonic movements may represent cortical irritability secondary to surgical manipulation, induced by electrical stimulation, reflecting progressive brain over-arousal. The attentive analysis of the relative beta power may have helped forecast the occurrence of the second seizure.LESSONS: We report the use of a simple, inexpensive, and portable EEG-based monitoring device to assist seizure detection and decision making. labels: #Adult#Anesthesia, General#Electroencephalography#Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic#Humans#Intraoperative Complications#Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring#Male'
b'Liver fibrosis, a common pathological process of chronic liver diseases, is the final stage of liver dysfunction that has severely deleterious impact on human health. Cytoglobin was first discovered in 2001 by proteomic analysis in rat stellate cells and was reported to play an important role in controlling tissue fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which cytoglobin inhibits or reverses the progression of fibrosis remains unclear. The present study examines the effect of recombinant human cytoblobin (rhCygb) in a rat model of liver fibrosis. Proteomic approaches were employed to identify differentially expressed proteins in the fibrosis model. Optimized conditions for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were developed to provide improved protein detection and separation. A total of 43 spots were obtained and, through the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 30 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Gene ontology term annotation and KEGG pathway analysis allowed us to explore the function of the represented proteins. Based on these results, we provide a theory of the molecular mechanism related to rhCygb reversion of fibrosis and which will assist in the identification of biomarkers in patient serum to improve early diagnosis of liver fibrosis. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushing and transbronchial biopsy are of fundamental importance in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting the lungs of immunosuppressed patients, especially those infected with HIV. This was a descriptive and retrospective study, in which the results of bronchoalveolar lavages, bronchial brushings and transbronchial biopsies of HIV-positive patients attended at the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro from 1999 to 2015 were reviewed to determine the most frequent findings in these patients, to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures and to correlate bronchoscopy results with clinical and radiological findings. Serological tests for HIV were confirmed and cases with negative or unverified serology were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for correlation with clinical and radiological findings. A total of 1,423 patients with a mean age of 50 years were initially selected; 727 cases had no serology for HIV; 696 had serology for HIV and 64 were positive. Of these, 47 were men, aged 24 to 84 years, and 17 women, aged 31 to 69 years. Biopsies and cytological tests were positive in 20 (31.25%) of the 64 patients and the most frequent diagnosis was pneumocystosis, found in 8 cases (12.5%). Of the 20 bronchofibroscopy-positive patients, only 2 did not show agreement between histopathological and clinical-radiological diagnoses. The analysis of the cytological tests and biopsy specimens obtained by bronchofibroscopy seems to be valuable for the etiological diagnosis of pulmonary infections in HIV- positive patients; however, negative results do not always exclude the diagnosis. In these cases, clinical symptoms and imaging findings may help to guide the best therapy. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Biopsy#Bronchoalveolar Lavage#Bronchoscopy#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Lung Diseases#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'Objective: To study common problems in BRAF gene mutation detection, and conditions for repetition testing using thyroid fine needle aspiration specimens. Methods: A total of 8 644 cases of thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens at China-Japan Friendship Hospital were collected between February, 2012 and July, 2018. BRAF gene mutation was detected by real-time PCR. Repeat testing was performed in 237 cases when the results were inconsistent with clinical or cytological diagnosis or when uncertain results were obtained. Results: The final positive rates of BRAF mutation was 22.0% (1 897/8 625). Nineteen cases were excluded due to inadequate DNA samples. The average Ct value of internal quality control was 16.061, and the average Ct value of the positive samples was 19.147. Among 237 repeat tests, 51.4% (19/37) continued to have poor DNA quality and 48.6% (18/37) had adequate DNA resulting in 1 positive case and 17 negative cases. In 40 repetition of initial negative cases, results were unchanged. In initial positive cases, 40.4% (40/99) with a difference of Ct value (between BRAF gene and internal quality control) between 8 to 12 turned negative after repetition, 69.8% (37/53) of these cases with a difference of more than 12 turned negative after repetition. The sensitivity and specificity of BRAF mutation were 83.97% and 96.94%, respectively. Conclusions: Difference between BRAF gene Ct value and internal quality control Ct value is recommended as a reliability index for the test result. Cases with a difference greater than 8 should be subjected to repeat testing. labels: #Biopsy, Fine-Needle#China#DNA Mutational Analysis#Humans#Mutation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Reproducibility of Results#Thyroid Nodule'
b"PURPOSE: This prospective study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of 'All-on-four' rehabilitations in controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Edentulous patients requiring an implant prosthetic restoration of one or both jaws were enrolled in the present study. Each patient received at least one fixed full-arch prosthesis. Four implants, immediately loaded, were placed in each jaw using the 'All-on-four' protocol. Marginal bone loss, implant and prosthetic failure, biological and mechanical complications, and serological levels (CD4 cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and HIV viral load) were recorded up to 7-year follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 116 implants were placed in 24 patients, and 29 rehabilitations based on the 'All-on-four' concept were achieved. Implant failures were registered in four patients (10 of 116 implants), and the implant survival rate was 91.37%. At the 7-year radiographic evaluation, peri-implant crestal bone loss averaged 1.91 \\xc2\\xb1 1.3 mm for upright maxillary implants (n = 30 implants) and 1.79 \\xc2\\xb1 1.28 mm for tilted maxillary implants (n = 30 implants). In the mandible, mean peri-implant crestal bone loss was 1.54 \\xc2\\xb1 1.27 mm for upright implants (n = 28) and 1.5 \\xc2\\xb1 1.3 mm for tilted implants (n = 28). No statistically significant correlation was found between serological parameters and marginal bone levels at 6 months, or through 7 years of annual follow-up (P > 0.05). A statistically significant linear correlation (P < 0.001) was found between early implant failure and HIV viral load. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly correlated with late implant failure (P = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this prospective 7-year longitudinal study, HIV-positive patients with a stable immune system can be candidates for the 'All-on-four' treatment concept. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Implants#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Prospective Studies"
b'Lung metastasis is a major cause of mortality in patients with osteosarcoma (OS). A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of OS lung metastasis may facilitate development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent the metastasis. We have established high- and low-metastatic sublines (LM8-H and LM8-L, respectively) from Dunn OS cell line LM8 by using in vivo image-guided screening. Among the genes whose expression was significantly increased in LM8-H compared to LM8-L, the transcription factor lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) was identified as a factor that promotes LM8-H cell extravasation into the lungs. To identify downstream effectors of LEF1 that are involved in OS lung metastasis, 13 genes were selected based on LM8 microarray data and genomewide meta-analysis of a public database for OS patients. Among them, the cytoglobin (Cygb) gene was identified as a key effector in promoting OS extravasation into the lungs. CYGB overexpression increased the extravasation ability of LM8-L cells, whereas knocking out the Cygb gene in LM8-H cells reduced this ability. Our results showed a novel LEF1-CYGB axis in OS lung metastasis and may provide a new way of developing therapeutic strategies to prevent OS lung metastasis. labels: #Cytoglobin'
b'Nitrite ([Formula: see text]) causes vasodilation in mammals due to the formation of (nitric oxide) NO by endogenous [Formula: see text] reduction in the vascular wall. In this study, we determined if a similar mechanism operates in amphibians. Dual-wire myography of the iliac artery from Rhinella marina showed that applied [Formula: see text] caused a concentration-dependent vasodilation in normoxia (21% O2; EC50: 438 \\xc2\\xb5M). Hypoxia (0.63% O2) significantly increased the maximal dilation to [Formula: see text] by 5% ( P = 0.0398). The addition of oxyhemoglobin significantly increased the EC50 ( P = 0.0144; EC50: 2,236 \\xc2\\xb5M) but did not affect the maximal vasodilation. In contrast, partially deoxygenated hemoglobin (90% desaturation) did not affect the EC50 ( P = 0.1189) but significantly ( P = 0.0012) increased the maximal dilation to [Formula: see text] by 11%. The soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) completely abolished the response to [Formula: see text] ( P < 0.0001), and of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, only N5-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-l-ornithine (vinyl-l-NIO; P = 0.0028) significantly reduced the [Formula: see text] vasodilation. The xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor allopurinol ( P = 0.927), the nitric oxide-scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazolyl-1-oxy-3-oxide (C-PTIO; P = 0.478), and disruption of the endothelium ( P = 0.094) did not affect the [Formula: see text] vasodilation. Incubation of iliac arteries with 1 mM [Formula: see text] did not a cause a change in the cGMP concentration (P = 0.407). Plasma [Formula: see text] was found to be 0.86\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.20 \\xc2\\xb5mol/l, while nitrate ([Formula: see text]) was 19.55\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x892.55 \\xc2\\xb5mol/l. Both cygb and ngb mRNAs were expressed in the iliac artery, and it is possible that these globins facilitate [Formula: see text] reduction in hypoxia.

b'BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, which seriously affects human health. Gramicidin is a short peptide antibiotic which could be used for treating infection induced by bacteria or fungi. However, the anti-cancer effect of gramicidin on gastric cancer cells and its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.RESULTS: Gastric cancer cells SGC-7901, BGC-823 and normal gastric mucosal cells GES-1 were treated with different concentrations of gramicidin respectively. The results of CCK-8 experiment revealed cellular toxicity of gramicidin to cancer cells while cell colony formation assay showed that gramicidin significantly inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, but had little effect on normal gastric mucosal cells. In addition, the wound healing assay showed that gramicidin inhibited the migration of SGC-7901 cell. Meanwhile, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis revealed that gramicidin induced cell apoptosis with G2/M cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that gramicidin down-regulated the expression of cyclinD1 and Bcl-2 as well as the FoxO1 phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: The current study illustrated the anti-tumor activity of gramicidin on gastric cancer cells, providing a possibility for gramicidin to be applied in clinical practice for the treatment of gastric cancer. labels: #Apoptosis#Cell Cycle#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Cyclin D1#Down-Regulation#Forkhead Box Protein O1#Gramicidin#Humans#Phosphorylation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2#Stomach Neoplasms'
b"OBJECTIVES: To assess the perceived facial changes in class II division 1, convex profile patients treated with functional followed by fixed orthodontic appliances.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 36 pairs of pre- and post-treatment photographs (frontal and profile, at rest) of 12 patients treated with activator, 12 with twin-block, and 12 controls with normal profiles, treated without functional appliances. All photographs were presented in pairs to 10 orthodontists, 10 patients, 10 parents, and 10 laypersons. Visual analog scale\\\\xc2\\\\xa0(VAS) ratings of changes in facial appearance were assessed.RESULTS: The patient groups were similar in sex distributions, age, and treatment duration. The different rater groups showed strong to excellent agreement. There were no significant differences among treatment groups (F\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.91; P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.526; Wilks lambda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.93), raters (F\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x891.68; P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.054; Wilks lambda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.83), and when testing the combined effect of treatment and rater on the results (F\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.72; P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.866; Wilks lambda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.85). The raters detected slightly more positive changes in the activator and twin-block groups, compared to the control group, regarding the lower face and the lips, but these findings did not reach significance. Furthermore, their magnitude hardly exceeded 1/20th of the total VAS length.LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design.CONCLUSIONS: The perceived facial changes of convex profile patients treated with functional, followed by fixed orthodontic appliances, did not differ from those observed in normal profile patients, when full-face frontal and profile photos were simultaneously assessed. Consequently, professionals should be skeptical regarding the improvement of a patient's facial appearance when this treatment option is used. labels: #Cephalometry#Esthetics#Face#Humans#Lip#Malocclusion, Angle Class II#Orthodontic Appliances, Functional#Orthodontists#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of scalp-acupuncture on the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), Interleukin (IL)-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2, zonula occludens-1(ZO-1) mRNA and Occludin mRNA in striatum in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (AICD) rats, so as to investigate its mechanisms underlying improvement of AICD.METHODS: Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly allocated to control, model, IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture groups (n=12 rats in each group). The AICD model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Rats of the IL-1Ra group and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group received intraperitoneal injection of IL-1Ra (0.05 mg\\\\xc2\\\\xb7kg-1\\\\xc2\\\\xb7d-1), once daily for 6 days. Scalp acupuncture stimulation was applied to bilateral "Dingnieqianxiexian" (MS6) once daily for 6 days for rats in IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group. Before and after intervention, the neurologic deficit score (NDS) was evalua-ted according to Longa\\\\\\\'s method. The expression of striatum PTX3 and IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA in the striatum tissue were detected by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. The Evans Blue (EB) tracer method was used to monitor the degree of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage.RESULTS: Following modeling, the NDS, EB content and the expression of PTX3 and IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2 in the striatum tissue were significantly increased, and the ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression was considerably decreased in the model group compared with the control group (P<0.05). After the interventions and compared with the model group, the NDS, EB content in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the striatum ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group were obviously up-regulated (P<0.05), and the expression of IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2 was obviously down-regulated in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05) rather than in the IL-1Ra group (P>0.05). The effects of scalp acupuncture combined with IL-1Ra were obviously superior to that of IL-1Ra in down-regulating NDS, EB content and IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2 expression level, and in up-regulating PTX3, ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression levels (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can improve neurological function and reduce the degree of BBB injury in AICD rats, which may be associated with its function in up-regulating the expression of PTX3 and in promoting the expression of ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#C-Reactive Protein#Cerebrovascular Disorders#Corpus Striatum#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Scalp#Serum Amyloid P-Component'

b'BACKGROUND: The timing and indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis remain controversial.METHODS: In a multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 145 asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis (defined as an aortic-valve area of ?0.75 cm2 with either an aortic jet velocity of ?4.5 m per second or a mean transaortic gradient of ?50 mm Hg) to early surgery or to conservative care according to the recommendations of current guidelines. The primary end point was a composite of death during or within 30 days after surgery (often called operative mortality) or death from cardiovascular causes during the entire follow-up period. The major secondary end point was death from any cause during follow-up.RESULTS: In the early-surgery group, 69 of 73 patients (95%) underwent surgery within 2 months after randomization, and there was no operative mortality. In an intention-to-treat analysis, a primary end-point event occurred in 1 patient in the early-surgery group (1%) and in 11 of 72 patients in the conservative-care group (15%) (hazard ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01 to 0.67; P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x890.003). Death from any cause occurred in 5 patients in the early-surgery group (7%) and in 15 patients in the conservative-care group (21%) (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.90). In the conservative-care group, the cumulative incidence of sudden death was 4% at 4 years and 14% at 8 years.CONCLUSIONS: Among asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis, the incidence of the composite of operative mortality or death from cardiovascular causes during the follow-up period was significantly lower among those who underwent early aortic-valve replacement surgery than among those who received conservative care.

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of the interaction teaching mode integrated with Visible Body virtual anatomy platform in teaching Meridian and Acupoints.METHODS: A total of 60 students in the class of 2017 in the discipline of acupuncture-moxibustion and tuina, Xiangnan University were recruited and randomized into an observation group and a control group, 30 students in each one. In the control group, the traditional practical teaching mode was used. In the observation group, the interaction teaching mode integrated with virtual anatomy platform was adopted. The teaching duration was 10 class hours in both groups. After accomplishing the teaching schedule, the practical examination was conducted in the localization of commonly-used acupoints, very useful acupoints and the dangerous acupoints as well as acupuncture manipulation techniques. Moreover, the degree of satisfaction was investigated among the students in the two groups and the self-learning ability was evaluated in 3-month follow-up visit.RESULTS: In the observation group, the scores for the localization and acupuncture manipulation of commonly-used acupoints, very useful acupoints and the dangerous acupoints, as well as the degree of satisfaction of the 3 items, i.e. interesting, interaction and leaning-assistance were all higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The degree of satisfaction in the acceptance and leaning-participation, as well as the scores of self-learning ability in 3-month follow-up visit were not different statistically between the two groups (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: The interaction teaching mode integrated with virtual anatomy platform improves the effect on teaching Meridian and Acupoints and achieves the high student satisfaction. labels: #Acupuncture#Acupuncture Points#Acupuncture Therapy#Humans#Meridians#Moxibustion#Teaching'

b'Background: The oral bacteria, mutans streptococci (MS), are an etiological agent of dental caries. Of MS, Streptococcus downei are rarely isolated bacteria.Aim: The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize S. downei from caries-active subjects.Materials and Methods: In all, 65 dental plaque samples were collected from dental caries-active subjects. All the isolates were further identified and characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing, biochemical tests, antibiogram, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).Results: Five isolates have been identified as S. downei using 16S rDNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that S. downei was closely related to S. sobrinus. The biotype traits of these five isolates were IV (n = 3), V (n = 1), and variants (n = 2). The study proposed one new biotype, classified as biotype VIII for the variant strain. The antibiogram tests revealed that all the strains of S. downei were susceptible to all the antibiotics used in the study with higher sensitivity to penicillin and ampicillin. The MIC of ampicillin and erythromycin against S. downei was 0.047 and 0.39 \\\\xc3\\\\xacg/mL, respectively.Conclusion: The study reports the prevalence of S. downei in caries-active subjects and recommends further investigations to determine its role in the disease. labels: #Dental Caries#Dental Plaque#Humans#Phylogeny#Streptococcus mutans'
b'Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are considered to be the main cause of spontaneous abortion (SA). We aimed to determine the differences in the rates and numbers of chromosomal abnormalities between samples from women with a history of one versus more than one SA as well as between samples from first- and second-trimester SAs in women from Northeast China.In total, 1210 products of conception (POCs) from patients with a history of one or more SAs were examined. Of these 1210 samples, 434 were from women with a history of 1 SA, and 776 were from women with a history of more than 1 SA. Additionally, 1071 samples were from the first trimester, 118 were from the second trimester, and 21 were from the third trimester. We identified chromosomal abnormalities by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Among the 1210 POCs in women with SA, 607 (50.17%) had fetal chromosomal abnormalities. There were no significant differences in the rates of chromosomal abnormalities according to the abortion frequency. However, first-trimester SA had a significantly higher percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities than second-trimester SA (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a<\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.05). Among 663 chromosomal abnormalities, 633 abnormalities occurred in first-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 16 (14.38%), followed by monosomy X (13.27%), trisomy 22 (7.90%), and trisomy 15 (5.37%). Thirty abnormalities occurred in second-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 18 (26.67%), followed by monosomy X (16.67%), trisomy 21 (13.33%), and trisomy 13 (10.00%). No chromosomal abnormalities occurred in the third trimester.These findings indicate the importance of determining the genetic cause of abortion in patients with a history of SA. We also identified a trend suggesting that the percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities is significantly higher in first- than second-trimester SA. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in POCs from SA can be increased by NGS, which is beneficial for couples with recurrent miscarriages and offers better genetic counseling in the clinical setting. labels: #Abortion, Spontaneous#Chromosome Aberrations#DNA Copy Number Variations#Female#Fetus#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Pregnancy'

b'This study investigated the toxicological, hematological and immunological effects of diets supplemented with levamisole and ivermectin on Colossoma macropomum. Fish were fed for 24, 96 and 240 h with diets containing 300, 600, 900 and 1200 mg of levamisole kg-1 of feed. None of the levamisole concentrations caused either mortality or behavioral alterations among the fish over 10 d of feeding. In comparison, a single feeding of ivermectin at 4500, 9000, 13500 or 18000 mg kg-1 caused 100% mortality among the fish within 10 h. There were no alterations in erythrocyte parameters or albumin in any treatments with levamisole after 24, 96 and 240 h of feeding. At concentrations of 900 and 1200 mg kg-1, levamisole caused decreases in the albumin-to-globulin ratio compared to the control group and the 300 and 600 mg kg-1 diet treatment groups. Levels of glucose and total plasma protein were higher in the fish fed with 600, 900 and 1200 mg kg-1 than in the controls and the 300 mg kg-1 diet treatment group. After 10 d of receiving feed supplemented with levamisole, globulin levels were higher in the 600 mg kg-1 group than in the controls. Respiratory burst activity of leukocytes also increased in the fish supplemented with the 900 and 1200 mg kg-1 diets compared to the controls and other treatments. This is the first study to investigate how diets supplemented with these drugs affect C. macropomum. Our research indicates that all the levamisole concentrations tested can be used in the diet of C. macropomum for antiparasitic treatments against helminth species, and that dietary treatments with levamisole can stimulate components of the innate immune system. labels: #Animal Feed#Animals#Characiformes#Diet#Dietary Supplements#Ivermectin#Levamisole'
b'This study aims to identify predictive factors related to clinical outcome, reoperation, and complications in patients with brain abscess.Patients with a diagnosis of brain abscess at discharge at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine between 2008 and 2018 were reviewed. Logistic regression was used to identify predictive factors associated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, GOS at 1 year after discharge, reoperation and complications.Among 183 patients enrolled into the study, 142 patients had a good outcome at discharge (GOS ? 4) and 41 had a poor outcome (GOS ? 3). During the follow-up period, 20 additional patients had a good outcome. A total of 156 patients were treated by open craniotomy excision (n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a72) and aspiration (n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a84), 10 of whom underwent reoperation. Complications in surgical patients for brain abscess occurred in 54 patients. Poor outcome was related to Glasgow coma scale (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.007) and ventricular proximity (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.001). Surgical method was associated with reoperation (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.04) and complications (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a<\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.001). Seizure at admission was related to epilepsy (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a<\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.001). Surgical method was related to postoperative intracranial hemorrhage (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.02).Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and ventricular proximity were associated with poor outcome. Further, patients who underwent aspiration were more likely to experience reoperation, while open craniotomy excision (OCE) was related to complications. Patients presenting seizure at admission were more likely to develop epilepsy. Patients who underwent OCE tended to experience postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Brain Abscess#Child#Child, Preschool#Craniotomy#Female#Glasgow Coma Scale#Glasgow Outcome Scale#Humans#Intracranial Hemorrhages#Male#Middle Aged#Postoperative Complications#Reoperation#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'

b'Objective: To investigate the incidence and related risk factors of ulnar nerve dysfunction after open reduction and internal fixation of humeral intercondylar fractures. Methods: A total of 168 patients who underwent open reduction and plate and screw fixation of a humeral intercondylar fracture between January 2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 85 males and 83 females, aged from 14 to 77 years with a mean age of (43\\\\xc2\\\\xb117) years. Diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy was defined as documentation of sensory and motor dysfunction of the ulnar nerve in the medical record. The explanatory (independent) variables included age, gender, injury type, AO typing, time from injury to surgery, surgery approach, plates fixation methods and whether the nerve was transposed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction. Results: Acute injury-related ulnar nerve neuropathy was diagnosed in 12(7.1%) of 168 patients. Among the other 156 patients without preoperative ulnar nerve neuropathy,the total postoperative ulnar neuropathy was found in 52 patients (33.3%), and in 26(16.7%) at the final follow-up, according to the McGowan grades system; 23(88.5%) of 26 patients were clinically graded as grade 1, and 3(11.5%) were graded as grade 2. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that triceps sparing approach (OR=2.639, P=0.039) and parallel double plate fixation (OR=3.089, P=0.046) were associated with a risk of postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction. Conclusion: There is a substantial incidence of postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction after open reduction and plate and screw fixation of humeral intercondylar fracture, postoperative ulnar neuropathy may occur from the time of injury through the long-term follow-up period, triceps sparing approach and parallel double plate fixation are the risk factors for ulnar neuropathy. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bone Plates#Female#Fracture Fixation, Internal#Humans#Humeral Fractures#Humerus#Incidence#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Treatment Outcome#Ulnar Nerve#Young Adult'
b'A new species of acarid mite, Naiadacarus sidorchukae sp. n., is described from phoretic deutonymphs collected from a European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, pheromone trap in Western Siberia, Russia. Morphologically, the new species is very similar to the North American species, Naiadacarus fashingi, with the only diagnostic character being the shorter tibial solenidion \\\\xc3\\\\xb6 II in the former species.

b'BACKGROUND: Aside effect of anti-angiogenic agent treatment is proteinuria. Evaluation of the severity of adverse effects and the decision to discontinue treatment is based on the qualitative analysis of urinary proteins. However, a qualitative analysis result may not be indicative of the actual amounts of protein excreted. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of using the urine protein/creatinine ratio(UPCR), instead of a qualitative urine analysis, to monitor patients treated with antiangiogenic agents.METHODS: Urinalysis data of patients receiving anti-angiogenic agents-bevacizumab, ramucirumab, or aflibercept-were retrospectively analyzed from clinical records. Acorrelation between the urine protein content(qualitative and quantitative analyses)and continuity of anti-angiogenic agent treatment was evaluated.RESULTS: Atotal of 24 patients (age, 70.83\\\\xc2\\\\xb17.45 years)who received treatment for colorectal cancer(n=17), lung cancer(n=4), gastric cancer(n=2), and breast cancer(n=1)were included. One hundred and sixty-five urinalysis results were collected. Alinear correlation between the qualitative urinalysis results(1+to 3+)and UPCR(r=0.746, p<0.01)was obtained. In patients with a urine protein content of 2+(qualitative analysis), the UPCR was <2.0 for 25 patients and ?2.0 but <3.5 for 4 patients. Similarly, in patients with a urine protein content of 3+, the UPCR was <2.0 for 3 patients and ?2.0 but <3.5 for 1 patient. Seventeen patients with a urine protein content of 2+ and 3 patients with a urine protein content of 3+ discontinued treatment with anti-angiogenic agents before estimation of the UPCR could be performed. These figures were reduced to 4 patients and 2 patients, respectively, following UPCR assessment.CONCLUSIONS: Switching the estimation of proteinuria from a qualitative analysis to UPCR might lead to better safety monitoring and prevent unnecessary discontinuation of anti-angio- genic agent treatment. labels: #Aged#Creatinine#Humans#Kidney Function Tests#Middle Aged#Proteinuria#Retrospective Studies#Urinalysis'
b'Here we provide a checklist of millipedes described or recorded in the literature from Venezuela. The diplopod fauna is comprised of eight orders, 18 families, 54 genera, and 157 species. The millipede orders Glomerida, Chordeumatida, Julida, Siphoniulida, and Platydesmida (known elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere) are not, as of yet, reported from the Venezuelan fauna. Two widely distributed invasive species, Asiomorpha coarctata and Oxidus gracilis, were recorded from Venezuela. All species records listed here contain comprehensive citation and synonymy lists. Numerous locality data are questionable and are discussed. For most species, the supposed deposition of the type specimens is given. However, the museum and gender information is taken mostly from the literature as the type specimen themselves were not examined. An analysis of records extracted from GBIF in 2016 and in 2018 was conducted and compared to the data captured from the published taxonomic literature. The data in this checklist are summarized online at the MilliBase website. labels: #Animal Distribution#Animals#Arthropods#Introduced Species#Venezuela'
b'Objective: To investigate whether type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the occurrence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and to compare the effects of different nature of diabetes duration on the risk of different anti-diabetic drugs. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. (1) 325 cases with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis complicated with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were selected as the study group and 601 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis as the control group. The relationship between diabetes mellitus and the risk of primary liver cancer was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. (2) Selected the study group and control group combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and used multivariate logistic regression analysis to study the relationship between diabetes-related factors and the risk of primary liver cancer. Results: The incidence of diabetes was 14.2% in the study group and 6.0% in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant between the two groups (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that type 2 diabetes was one of the independent risk factors for primary hepatocellular carcinoma, which had increased the risk of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.982, 95% CI: 1.224-3.210). Patients with diabetes > 10 years (adjusted ratio: AOR value 6.011, 95% CI: 1.659-21.777) were at significantly higher risk for primary hepatocellular carcinoma than that of patients with diabetes < 10 years. Metformin (adjusted odds ratio: AOR 0.188, 95% CI: 0.052-0.688) had reduced the risk, while insulin (adjusted odds ratio: AOR 6.682, 95% CI: 1.899-23.510) had increased the risk. Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the independent risk factors for primary HCC, which can increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B cirrhosis in relation to the duration of diabetes mellitus. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is higher in patients with duration of diabetes > 10 years and metformin reduces the risk. labels: #Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Case-Control Studies#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Hepatitis B#Humans#Liver Cirrhosis#Liver Neoplasms#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors'
b"During the last decade, China's agro-food production has increased rapidly and been accompanied by the challenge of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental pollutants from fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive energy use. Understanding the energy use and environmental impacts of crop production will help identify environmentally damaging hotspots of agro-production, allowing environmental impacts to be assessed and crop management strategies optimized. Conventional farming has been widely employed in wolfberry (Lycium barbarum) cultivation in China, which is an important cash tree crop not only for the rural economy but also from an ecological standpoint. Energy use and global warming potential (GWP) were investigated in a wolfberry production system in the Yellow River irrigated Jingtai region of Gansu. In total, 52 household farms were randomly selected to conduct the investigation using questionnaires. Total energy input and output were 321,800.73 and 166,888.80\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89MJ\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89ha-1, respectively, in the production system. The highest share of energy inputs was found to be electricity consumption for lifting irrigation water, accounting for 68.52%, followed by chemical fertilizer application (11.37%). Energy use efficiency was 0.52 when considering both fruit and pruned wood. Nonrenewable energy use (88.52%) was far larger than the renewable energy input. The share of GWP of different inputs were 64.52% electricity, 27.72% nitrogen (N) fertilizer, 5.07% phosphate, 2.32% diesel, and 0.37% potassium, respectively. The highest share was related to electricity consumption for irrigation, followed by N fertilizer use. Total GWP in the wolfberry planting system was 26,018.64\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89kg CO2 eq ha-1 and the share of CO2, N2O, and CH4 were 99.47%, 0.48%, and negligible respectively with CO2 being dominant. Pathways for reducing energy use and GHG emission mitigation include: conversion to low carbon farming to establish a sustainable and cleaner production system with options of raising water use efficiency by adopting a seasonal gradient water pricing system and advanced irrigation techniques; reducing synthetic fertilizer use; and policy support: smallholder farmland transfer (concentration) for scale production, credit (small- and low-interest credit) and tax breaks. labels: #Agriculture#Carbon#China#Fertilizers#Global Warming#Greenhouse Effect#Lycium#Methane#Nitrous Oxide"
b'To study the concentration of vasculoendothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mixed saliva and serum of patients in normal conditions and with generalized periodontitis. The main group (n = 42) was represented by patients with generalized periodontitis. The comparison group (n = 36) consisted of patients without periodontal tissue diseases. The concentration of VEFR was determined by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial test-system "VEGF - IFA - BEST" (A-8784) ("Vector - Best", Russia). The median values VEFR in saliva were 5.49 times higher than the values for serum in the main group (p = 0.000000) and 7.01 times in the comparison group (p = 0.000000). The concentration of VEFR in the saliva of the examined main group exceeded the similar values of the comparison group (p = 0,014857); the median and interquartile range for the main group was 1098.45 (925.5; 1291) pg/ml, and for the comparison group 1360.5 (998.9; 2062) pg/ml. There were no differences in the serum VEFR concentration (p = 0.775124). No significant correlation was found between the serum VEFR content and the mixed saliva. The Spearman\\\\\\\'s rank correlation coefficient for the main group was R = 0,0184358, and for the comparison group, respectively, R = 0.188932. The source of VEFR in saliva are the glands and cells of the oral mucosa, and not the process of exudation from blood serum. The high content of VEFR in the saliva of healthy people and a decrease in its level during periodontitis indicates the important role of this protein in the processes of maintaining the normal state of periodontal tissues and reparation of tissues of the oral mucosa. labels: #Humans#Periodontitis#Russia#Saliva#Serum#Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A'
b'The reagent kit AmpligenBurk-mallei/pseudomallei-RT PCR is designed for detecting in vitro diagnostics and differentiate the DNA of glanders and melioidosis pathogens by real-time multiplex PCR in biological (clinical) material and cultures of microorganisms, as well as environmental objects and solid food products (rice). During clinical testing diagnostic value of reagent kit AmpligenBurk-mallei/pseudomallei-RT PCR has been studied. Based on the results obtained, a high analytical sensitivity (1?103 microbe cells/ml) and specificity (100%) of PCR-RT with the developed reagent kit were established, regardless of the type of material being studied.

b'PURPOSE: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exist as heterogeneous subsets and have dichotomous roles in cancer-immune evasion. This study aims to assess the clinical effects of Galectin-9+ tumor-associated macrophages (Gal-9+TAMs) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified Gal-9+TAMs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of a tumor microarray (TMA) (n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89141) from the Zhongshan Hospital and by flow cytometric analysis of tumor specimens (n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8920) from the Shanghai Cancer Center. The survival benefit of platinum-based chemotherapy in this subpopulation was evaluated. The effect of the tumor-immune microenvironment with different percentages of Gal-9+TAMs was explored.RESULTS: The frequency of Gal-9+TAMs increased with tumor stage and grade. Gal-9+TAMs predicted poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and were better than Gal-9-TAMs and TAMs to discriminate prognostic groups. In univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, patients with high percentages of Gal-9+TAMs showed the prominent survival benefit after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). High Gal-9+TAM infiltration correlated with increasing numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and mast cells and decreasing numbers of CD8+T and dendritic cells (DCs). Dense infiltration of Gal-9+TAMs was related to reduced cytotoxic molecules, enhanced immune checkpoints or immunosuppressive cytokines expressed by immune cells, as well as active proliferation of tumor cells. Additionally, the subpopulation accumulated was strongly associated with PD-1+TIM-3+CD8+T cells.CONCLUSIONS: Gal-9+TAMs predicted OS and RFS and response to ACT in MIBC patients. High Gal-9+TAMs were associated with a pro-tumor immune contexture concomitant with T cell exhaustion. labels: #Adult#Biomarkers, Pharmacological#Cell Movement#Chemotherapy, Adjuvant#Female#Galectins#Humans#Macrophages#Male#Microarray Analysis#Middle Aged#Muscles#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Survival Analysis#T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory#Tumor Escape#Tumor Microenvironment#Urinary Bladder Neoplasms'
b'Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen colonizing the oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastrointestinal mucosa in most healthy humans. In immunocompromised hosts, this fungal organism can cause mucosal candidiasis in these sites. C. albicans also causes fungemia, a serious consequence of cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is thought to develop from fungal translocation through compromised mucosal barriers. Changes in endogenous bacterial population size or composition as well as changes in the host environment can transform fungal commensals into opportunistic pathogens in the upper and lower GI tract. Pioneering studies from our group have shown that a ubiquitous oral commensal of the mitis streptococcal group (Streptococcus oralis) has a mutualistic relationship with C. albicans, with C. albicans enabling streptococcal biofilm growth at mucosal sites, and S. oralis facilitating invasion of the oral and esophageal mucosa by C. albicans. In these studies, we used a cortisone-induced immunosuppression mouse model. More recently, the development of a novel mouse chemotherapy model has allowed us to examine the interactions of C. albicans with the endogenous bacterial microbiota in the oral and small intestinal mucosa, two sites adversely affected by cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this model, oral inoculation with C. albicans causes severe dysbiosis in the mucosal bacterial composition in both sites. We also found that antibiotic treatment ameliorates invasion of the oral mucosa but aggravates dissemination through the intestinal mucosa. In this chapter, we discuss work from our laboratory and others examining the relationships of C. albicans with oral bacteria and their role in mucosal homeostasis or disease. labels: #Animals#Candida albicans#Candidiasis#Disease Models, Animal#Homeostasis#Humans#Mice#Microbiota#Mouth Mucosa#Streptococcus oralis'
b'PURPOSE: To verify the effect of dog intervention on the regular session of speech therapy for developmental stuttering in adults.METHODS: The study involved young adults and adults with developmental stuttering. The study sample was composed of eight participants, six males and two females, ranging in age from 16 to 45 years. Participants were divided into two groups: G1 - those who underwent treatment for stuttering with the presence of a dog-therapist in the therapy room and G2 - those who underwent treatment for stuttering without the presence of the dog therapist. We included a control group, G3, composed of fluent participants, matched in age and sex to G1 and G2 to control the natural variability of speech fluency.RESULTS: Comparative results between the groups indicated that the group that performed the treatment without the presence of the dog achieved better performance, evolution and efficacy rates.CONCLUSION: for the population in this study, the dog intervention on speech therapy did not improve treatment. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Animal Assisted Therapy#Animals#Dogs#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Pilot Projects#Speech Therapy#Stuttering#Young Adult'
b'PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The pilot study deals with the current situation in proximal femoral fractures in culturally diverse regions, namely in Afghanistan (AFG) and in the Czech Republic (CZ). The study aimed to find out whether there are any differences in proximal femoral fractures in dependence on the selected criteria between the two culturally diverse areas. The study used the data of patients who underwent surgery for proximal femoral fracture at the Department of Orthopaedics of the 1 s t Medical Faculty of the Charles University and the Military University Hospital and at the Military Base Hospital Kabul. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included patients aged 21 years or older who sustained a proximal femoral fracture in the period from October 2013 to February 2014. For the period concerned, the evaluation comprised 44 patients with a proximal femoral fracture from the Military Base Hospital Kabul, of whom 25 women and 19 men, and a total of 71 patients with a proximal femoral fracture from the Department of Orthopaedics of the 1st Medical Faculty of the Charles University and the Military University Hospital, of whom 43 women and 28 men. Based on the medical documentation, the following evaluation parameters were selected: age, sex, type of fracture. The data was processed using descriptive statistics, one-way and multifactorial analysis (ANOVA) and the POST-HOC test (Fisher LSD test, confidence interval = 95%) RESULTS The mean age of all the patients who suffered a fracture of proximal femur in AFG (58 years) was considerably lower (p < 0.001) than in patients in CZ (81 years). Similarly, a significant difference (p <0.001) was identified in the age of men and women treated for a proximal femoral fracture in both the countries. In AFG there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.002) between the age of men and women, where women sustaining fractures were younger (54 years) compared to men (63 years). In CZ no significant age difference was reported (83 years vs 78 years). In AFG, the observed fractures occurred generally in their 6th and 7th decade, whereas in CZ only in their 9th decade. The incidence of proximal femoral fractures in Afghan women is the highest in their 5th and 6th decade. Pertrochanteric fractures and intracapsular fractures prevailed in both countries. The lowest age in both types of the fracture was reported in Afghan women (52 years in femoral neck fracture, p <0.001, 54 years in trochanteric fracture, p = 0.039). DISCUSSION Significant differences between the patients in AFG and CZ concern several factors. Afghanistan is a country with the lowest average life expectancy. In the Afghan population a major Vitamin D deficiency was confirmed. This is related to the conservative dress code, especially in women, when the Vitamin D synthesis is suppressed. That can cause the occurrence of osteoporosis in women at a considerably younger age than in the population in the Czech Republic, which is subsequently accompanied by an increased incidence of proximal femoral fractures. Similar results, however, were also obtained in men. One of the risk factors of osteoporosis development is also low physical activity throughout the lifetime. This risk factor is significant primarily in female population in the Muslim world. Afghanistan also faces serious malnutrition. All of that is reflected in low life expectancy in the given country, incidence of osteoporosis and injuries in this region. There is reasonable evidence that the mortality in a causal relationship with proximal femoral fracture is substantially higher in this region than in Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS The results of the pilot study showed that there are significant differences in age and frequency of fractures in dependence on sex and country. The obtained results can be considered valuable since there are virtually no scientific or professional studies on osteoporosis and fractures in the given area that would help physicians get ready for significant differences. These results may become a source of valuable information not only for medical practitioners coming to Afghanistan to help as volunteers in the framework of developmental assistance from all over the world, but also for physicians from Europe, with respect to the wave of migrants coming from this area.

b'The small galatheid squat lobster genus Phylladiorhynchus currently contains five species, three of which supposedly have wide Indo-Pacific distributions. To date, two putatively widespread species, P. pusillus and P. integrirostris have been recorded from New Zealand and Australian waters. Here, we review the New Zealand and eastern Australian species of Phylladiorhynchus based on extensive collections from the region using morphological and molecular data. The type species, P. pusillus (Henderson, 1885) (type locality: Twofold Bay, Australia) is redescribed and shown to occur on both sides of the Tasman Sea. Phylladiorhynchus integrirostris, for which the original Hawaiian type material has been lost, is redescribed based on a neotype and shown not to occur in New Zealand or Australian waters, previous records being referable to other species. Six new species of Phylladiorhynchus are described. Seven species of Phylladiorhynchus are now known from New Zealand and eastern Australia. A key to all species of the genus is provided.

b'Objective: To investigate the current status of the occupational hazards of welding fume, manganese, and manganese compounds in the welding environment of a large container manufacturing enterprise, as well as the status of occupational health examination of workers, and to provide a basis for improving the welding environment of this enterprise. Methods: In August 2016, July 2017, and August 2018, convenience sampling was used to perform an on-site occupational hygiene survey of the welding workshop for three consecutive years, and welding fume, manganese and, manganese compounds (counted as manganese dioxide) were measured for their workplace exposure concentrations and exposure levels in workers. A comprehensive analysis was performed for the results of occupational health examination. Results: Welding fume, manganese, and manganese compounds in the welding environment gradually increased from 2016 to 2018 (\\\\xc3\\\\xb7(2)(trend)=5.14 and 5.54, P<0.05). The maximum over-standard rate of concentration-short term exposure limit was 43.3% (13/30) for welding fume and 40.0% (12/30) for manganese and its compounds, and the maximum over-standard rate of time-weighted average concentration was 26.7% (8/30) for welding fume and 23.3% (7/30) for manganese and its compounds. Abnormalities were observed in the occupational health examination of welding workers in 2016-2018, among which respiratory system abnormalities (cough, expectoration, and wheezing), nervous system abnormalities (dizziness, fatigue, sleep disorders, amnesia, hyperhidrosis, and palpitations), and electrocardiogram abnormalities (bundle conduction block) had an incidence rate of above 10.0%, and the incidence rate of abnormalities on posterior-anterior X-ray high-kV chest radiograph was close to 8.9% (30/336) . Conclusion: There is severe exposure to welding fume, manganese, and manganese compounds among workers in this enterprise, which cause great hazards to the health of workers. It is necessary to strengthen occupational health management, take measures to improve the welding environment, and enhance occupational disease prevention. labels: #Air Pollutants, Occupational#Humans#Inhalation Exposure#Manganese#Manganese Compounds#Occupational Diseases#Occupational Exposure#Welding'
b'BACKGROUND: Many countries have stockpiled vaccines because of concerns about the reemergence of smallpox. Traditional smallpox vaccines are based on replicating vaccinia viruses; these vaccines have considerable side effects.METHODS: To evaluate the efficacy of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) as a potential smallpox vaccine, we randomly assigned 440 participants to receive two doses of MVA followed by one dose of the established replicating-vaccinia vaccine ACAM2000 (the MVA group) or to receive one dose of ACAM2000 (the ACAM2000-only group). The two primary end points were noninferiority of the MVA vaccine to ACAM2000 with respect to the peak serum neutralizing antibody titers and attenuation of the ACAM2000-associated major cutaneous reaction by previous MVA vaccination, measured according to the maximum lesion area and the derived area attenuation ratio.RESULTS: A total of 220 and 213 participants were randomly assigned and vaccinated in the MVA group and ACAM2000-only group, respectively, and 208 participants received two MVA vaccinations. At peak visits, MVA vaccination induced a geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibodies of 153.5 at week 6, as compared with 79.3 at week 4 with ACAM2000 (a ratio of 1.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.56 to 2.40]). At day 14, the geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibodies induced by a single MVA vaccination (16.2) was equal to that induced by ACAM2000 (16.2), and the percentages of participants with seroconversion were similar (90.8% and 91.8%, respectively). The median lesion areas of the major cutaneous reaction were 0 mm2 in the MVA group and 76.0 mm2 in the ACAM2000-only group, resulting in an area attenuation ratio of 97.9% (95% CI, 96.6 to 98.3). There were fewer adverse events or adverse events of grade 3 or higher after both MVA vaccination periods in the MVA group than in the ACAM2000-only group (17 vs. 64 participants with adverse events of grade 3 or higher, P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: No safety concerns associated with the MVA vaccine were identified. Immune responses and attenuation of the major cutaneous reaction suggest that this MVA vaccine protected against variola infection.

b'The marine Chironomidae Ainuyusurika Sasa et Shirasaka, 1988, previously known from the adults only, is associated with its immature stages for the first time based on reared specimens from Oriental China. The larva resembles those of Sergentia Kieffer and Endochironomus Kieffer in the ventromental plate with an anteromedial projection and the 5-segmented antenna with opposite Lauterborn organs. The pupal thoracic horn has 12 branches at maximum and netted tergite spinulation which appears to be similar to those of Polypedilum Kieffer, Endotribelos Grodhaus, Phaenopsectra Kieffer and Sergentia. The phylogenetic relationship was furtherly explored through molecular analysis based on concatenation of five gene makers (18S, 28S, CAD1, CAD4 and COI-3P) using both mixed-model Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference methods. The result shows Ainuyusurika is nested with an assemblage of Endochironomus, Phaenopsectra and Endotribelos. We concluded that Ainuyusurika is a good independent genus showing affinity with Endochironomus-Phaenopsectra related genera. labels: #Animals#Bayes Theorem#China#Chironomidae#Larva#Phylogeny#Pupa'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of calcium-sensitive receptors (CaSR) on the expression of 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2) and cortisol concentration in a neonatal mouse model of persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH).METHODS: Fifty-six newborn C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a control group (n=14), a PPH group (n=14), an agonist group (n=14), and an inhibitor group (n=14). The mice in the PPH, agonist, and inhibitor groups were exposed to a 12% oxygen concentration, and the agonist group and inhibitor group were given CaSR agonist (GdCl3, 16 mg/kg) and CaSR antagonist (NPS2390, 1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally once a day, respectively. The mice in control group were exposed to air, and then injected with an equal volume of normal saline as those in the PPH group every day. All mice were treated for 14 days. Morphological examination of heart and lung tissues was performed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expression levels of 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 mRNA and 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 protein in lung tissues were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cortisol levels in lung tissues were determined using ELISA.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the PPH group had significantly increased pulmonary artery wall thickness (WT%), ratio of right to left ventricular thickness (RV/LV), alveolar mean linear intercept, and BNP concentration and a significantly reduced radial alveolar count (P<0.05); compared with the PPH group, the agonist group showed significant increases in WT% and BNP concentration, while the inhibitor group showed significant reductions in the two indicators (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the PPH group showed significant reductions in the expression levels of 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 mRNA and 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 protein, but a significant increase in cortisol concentration (P<0.05); compared with the PPH group, the agonist group had significantly lower expression levels of 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 mRNA and 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 protein, but a significant higher cortisol concentration, while the inhibitor group showed opposite changes in these indicators (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: CaSR may control the development and progression of PPH in newborn mice by regulating the expression of 11\\\\xc3\\\\xa2-HSD2 and cortisol concentration. labels: #11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2#Animals#Animals, Newborn#Calcium#Hydrocortisone#Hypertension, Pulmonary#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Receptors, Calcium-Sensing'
b'When Walther Horn described Heptodonta hennigi from Assam in 1898, on the basis of a single female, he was completely uncertain about which genus he should classify this species in. He wrote that he could not identify the genus, but that the closest looking species he knew were Heptodonta tricondyloides Gestro, which is now placed in the genus Dilatotarsa Dokhtouroff, and Euryoda (= Prothyma Hope) lucidicollis Chaudoir. He was especially confused by the shape of the pronotum, but also by the lack of pubescens on the lateral margin of the metacoxae, which is a typical character for the genus Heptodonta Hope (see also Fowler 1912). Hence, twelve years later, Horn (1910) transferred hennigi to the Madagascan genus Physodeutera Lacordaire, which he regarded as a "group" of the genus Prothyma Hope. After more than eighty years, Wiesner (1992) placed the species in the Philippine Prothyma subgenus Symplecthyma Rivalier, but also indicated his classification as doubtful with a question mark. Cassola (2002) suggested for the first time a possible affiliation to the genus Pronyssa Bates.

b'BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) non-pharmaceutical therapies are frequently used for chronic insomnia in China, but in clinical practice, most practitioners choose appropriate treatments based on personal experience. In our study, Bayesian network meta-analysis will be used to identify differences in efficacy and safety between diverse non-pharmaceutical therapies for chronic adult insomnia.METHODS: The authors will totally retrieve seven electronic databases from their establishment to August 2019 in accordance with relevant strategies. After a series of screening, the 2 researchers will employ the Aggregate Data Drug Information System (ADDIS) and R software to analyze the data extracted from enclosed Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). Ultimately, the evidentiary grade of the results will be evaluated.RESULTS: This study will provide reliable evidence for different non-pharmaceutical therapies on chronic insomnia in adults.CONCLUSIONS: The findings will be an available reference to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different non-pharmaceutical therapies on chronic insomnia in adults and may provide decision-making reference on which method to choose for clinicians.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42019141496. labels: #Adult#Bayes Theorem#Chronic Disease#Female#Humans#Male#Medicine, Chinese Traditional#Network Meta-Analysis#Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders#Treatment Outcome'
b'When studying the effect of the metabolic products of clinical isolates of enterococci on the viability of Candida albicans, it was found that metabolites of all tested strains of Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis had a fungistatic effect. At the same time a reliable fungicidal effect is a strain-specific feature. It is better to use the method of delayed antagonism on double-layer agar to assess the antifungal effect of enterococcal metabolism products. labels: #Antifungal Agents#Candida#Enterococcus faecalis#Enterococcus faecium#Microbial Sensitivity Tests'

b'As a kind of earth-abundant and cheap natural clay mineral, palygorskite (Pal) was facilely modified by grafting with graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate GO/Pal composites for rapid removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions. The results of characterization confirmed that the GO/Pal composites were successfully grafted between GO sheets and Pal nanorods. The effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, adsorption time, initial Pb(II) concentration and temperature on the adsorption of Pb(II) onto the GO/Pal composites as adsorbents were systematically investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity over 106.6 mg/g was obtained within a short adsorption time of less than 1 h even at 298.15 K. The adsorption of Pb(II) was a fast process that more accurately followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation. This process also could be described better with the Langmuir equation model than the Freundlich model. The negative values of \\\\xc3\\\\x84G\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 and the positive values of \\\\xc3\\\\x84H\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 and \\\\xc3\\\\x84S\\\\xc2\\\\xb0 indicated that it was a spontaneous, endothermic and entropy-increasing adsorption process. Compared with pristine Pal and GO powders, such the GO/Pal composites as a cost-efficient and eco-friendly adsorbents could significantly improve the adsorption properties of Pb(II) and would have potential application in the industrial wastewater treatment for rapid removal of Pb(II). labels: #Adsorption#Graphite#Hydrogen-Ion Concentration#Kinetics#Lead#Magnesium Compounds#Oxides#Silicon Compounds#Solutions#Water Pollutants, Chemical#Water Purification'
b'The present study is aimed to clarify the utility of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and the additional value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).This retrospective study involved 38 patients with PDAC concomitant with IPMN and 114 patients (control) who were randomly selected from 320 patients with IPMN without PDAC and were matched with cases for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strength (1.5\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8aT/3.0\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8aT). Two radiologists reviewed the 2 MR image sets with relevant clinical information blinded, first MRCP alone and then combined MRI set including DWI. Diagnostic capability and interobserver agreement were assessed by using receiver operating characteristics curve (Az) analysis and weighted \\\\xc3\\\\xaa statistics.Az values for the 2 observers were 0.834 and 0.821 for MRCP alone and 0.964 and 0.926 for the combined MRI (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a<\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.001 and P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a<\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.001), respectively. The sensitivity of MRCP alone was 61% (23/38), with both observers failing to diagnose PDACs located at the end of tail or away from the pancreatic duct. Meanwhile, with combined MRI, sensitivity was significantly increased for both observers (61% to 92%, P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.002; 61% to 87%, P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.004). Moreover, the interobserver agreement was higher with combined MRI (\\\\xc3\\\\xaa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a0.85) than MRCP alone (\\\\xc3\\\\xaa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a0.59).MRCP and DWI might be a superior option with a higher diagnostic capability of PDAC concomitant with IPMN than MRCP alone, especially for tumors away from the pancreatic duct. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal#Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance#Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasms, Multiple Primary#Pancreatic Intraductal Neoplasms#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Retrospective Studies'

b'PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Arthrodesis of interphalangeal joints of the hand is a method used to treat conditions associated with joint destruction, instability and pain. Our study aims to evaluate the outcomes of the treatment of sequelae of septic arthritis of interphalangeal joints by arthrodesis with external fixation. This topic is hardly covered in literature. Moreover, it compares the outcomes of application of this method in diabetic patients and non-diabetic population. MATERIAL AND METHODS Arthrodesis by means of Stellbrink external fixator was performed in 17 patients who had suffered septic arthritis of interphalangeal joints of the hand. The following parameters were followed in patients in our group: age, sex, etiology of disease, smoking, diabetes, affected fingers and joints of the hand, side, microbial culture finding, wound healing, postoperative ATB therapy and its duration, radiographic signs of the union of arthrodesis and potential complications. RESULTS The group included 8 men and 9 women. The mean age was 66.2 years. 5 patients in the group were diabetic. In 16 patients the wound healed per primam, in 1 case per secundam. The average duration of postoperative ATB therapy was 4.3 weeks. The X-ray showed the union of fused articular surfaces at 6.9 weeks on average. Complications occurred in 3 patients, namely 1 case of secondary wound healing, 1 case of nail bed damage and 1 case of flexor tenosynovitis of the operated finger. The arthrodesis was successfully healed in all the patients and a no difference was detected between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. DISCUSSION When arthrodesis of interphalangeal joints of the hand is performed using an external fixator, the metal material is introduced outside the area of inflammation, or the field potentially at risk of infection, therefore this method is predetermined for surgeries in the terrain changed by inflammation or potentially at risk of inflammation. Compared to the other methods such as arthrodesis by inserting K-wires intramedullary, there is no risk of migration of the metal material and the associated soft tissue irritation. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the safety and efficiency of arthrodesis of interphalangeal joints of the hand by means of an external fixator in treating the sequelae of septic arthritis. The union of arthrodesis with no complications was observed even in all the diabetic patients. Ranking among the main advantages of this method are the easy care for the surgical wound, achievement of easy and firm fixation with the possibility to apply an external fixator outside the area of the original infection.

b'OBJECTIVE: To explore whether manual acupuncture stimulation of "Shenshu " (BL23), "Guanyuan" (CV4), "Zhongwan" (CV12) can improve the ovarian function by resisting oxidant stress and reducing apoptosis of granulosa cells in rats with ovarian hypofunction.METHODS: Forty female SD rats with normal estrous cycles were randomly divided into blank control, model, hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (n=10 rats in each group). The ovarian hypofunction model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides suspension (50 mg\\\\xc2\\\\xb7kg-1\\\\xc2\\\\xb7d-1) for 14 successive days. Rats of the hormone therapy group were treated by gavage of estrogen and progesterone, and those of the acupuncture group treated by manual acupuncture stimulation of bilateral BL23 or CV4 and CV12 alternatively by using uniform reinforcing-reducing method for 10 s every 5 min (3 times in 10 min). The treatment was performed once daily for 14 days. The blank group was given equal volume of normal saline daily. On the 9th day, the estrous cycle of each rat was observed by means of vaginal smear test. The ovarian index, serum estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were detected by ELISA. Histopathological changes of the ovary tissue were observed by H.E. staining. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 and their mRNAs of the ovaries were determined by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real time-PCR separately.RESULTS: The menstrual disorder rate was 100% in the model group, and was significantly higher than those in the hormone therapy (30%) and acupuncture (40%) groups (P<0.01). Following modeling, the ovarian wet weight and index, E2 and SOD contents, Bcl-2 protein and mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and serum FSH, LH and MDA levels, Bax protein and mRNA expressions were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01) in the model group in comparison with the blank control group. H.E. staining showed a large amount of connective tissue in the ovary, with fewer mature follicles, increase of atresia follicles, significant reduction of luteal tissue, and appearance of scarring tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, there were more mature follicles, fewer atresia follicles, lower abnormal granulosa cell morphology and lower estrous cycle disorder ratio in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups. After the interventions, the decreased ovarian wet weight and index, serum E2 and SOD contents, expressions of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the increased levels of FSH and LH, MDA, expressions of Bax protein and mRNA were significantly decreased in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The effect of acupuncture was significantly superior to that of hormone in up-regulating SOD, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expressions (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve the menstrual disorder in rats with ovarian hypofunction, which is closely related to its effects in improving antioxidant stress ability and regulating the expressions of apoptosis-related protein and mRNA of ovarian gra-nulosa cells. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#Apoptosis#Female#Glycosides#Oxidative Stress#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Tripterygium'
b'Conventional cotton production in western Bahia, Brazil, involves intensive use of agricultural inputs and mechanization, which may affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This work aimed at studying the impact of conventional and organic cotton production in the AMF of western Bahia. Soil samples were obtained from conventional white cotton and colored cotton organic production systems as well as from native Cerrado areas, close to the white cotton fields, and from the subcaducifolia vegetation, close to the organic colored cotton farms. The most frequent species in the conventional farming areas belonged to the genera Acaulospora (10 spp.); Glomus (8 spp.); Dentiscutata (3 spp.); Ambispora, Pacispora and Scutellospora (2 spp. each), as well as Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Diversispora sp., Entrophospora infrequens, Gigaspora sp., Orbispora pernambucana, Paradentiscutata maritima, and Paraglomus occultum. Eighteen species were found in the organic farming areas, with the predominance of Glomus (5 spp.) and Acaulospora (5 spp.), and with Claroideoglomus, Dentiscutata, Gigaspora, Corymbiglomus, Orbispora, Paraglomus, Scutellospora, and Simiglomus (1 spp. each). Paraglomus bolivianum was first reported in Cerrado. In the native vegetation, nine species were found, with the predominance of Glomus and Acaulospora. The highest number of AMF species was found in the organic farming areas, which deserves further investigation. labels: #Agriculture#Brazil#Gossypium#Mycorrhizae#Soil Microbiology'
b"OBJECTIVE: To observe the impact of the use of capnography system adapted to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). To measure the concordance between values obtained from continuous monitoring of partial pressure of carbon dioxide in membrane oxygenator exhaustion (PeCO2) and the results observed on arterial blood gas test.METHODS: Participated in this study 40 patients submitted to elective cardiovascular surgery with CPB. They were divided into two groups: Group 1, with 20 patients submitted to the surgical procedure using blood gas analysis at intermittent intervals (20 - 30 minutes); Group 2, with 20 patients operated with a capnography system adapted applied to membrane oxygenator exhaustion and blood gas test. A test was used to compare arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) from group 1 and group 2. In group 2, the strength of the correlation between PeCO2 and PaCO2 was evaluated by a linear regression test. The Bland-Altman method was used to determine the degree of agreement between the two variables.RESULTS: Average and standard deviation of Group 1's PaCO2 (34.6 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 7.44) and Group 2's PaCO2 / PeCO2 (36.5 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 4.42) / (39.9 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 3.98). There was no statistically significant difference in PaCO2 between the groups (P = 0.21). In group 2, PeCO2 and PaCO2 analyzed corrected for esophageal temperature obtained a positive linear correlation (r = 0.79, P < 0.001), the degree of agreement presented an average 3.47 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 2.70 mmHg.CONCLUSION: The continuous PeCO2 monitoring from cardiopulmonary bypass circuit has a positive impact on the result of PaCO2. This instrument confirms and maintains the carbon dioxide (CO2) values into reference parameters. labels: #Blood Gas Analysis#Capnography#Carbon Dioxide#Cardiopulmonary Bypass#Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures#Humans#Monitoring, Intraoperative#Oxygenators, Membrane#Partial Pressure"

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe differential peptidomics in the hippocampal tissue in a rat model of premature white matter injury, and to investigate the mechanism of premature white matter injury.METHODS: Twenty neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally divided into a control group and a model group. Rats in the model group underwent permanent ligation of the right common carotid artery 2 days after birth, followed by 2 hours of hypoxia. For rats in the control group, the right common carotid artery was isolated, but without ligation and hypoxia. Brain tissue samples were collected from the two groups, and hippocampal tissue was isolated. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with tandem mass spectrometry was used for peptidomic profiling of hippocampal tissue, and the differentially expressed peptides between the two groups were subjected to bioinformatics analysis to assess their possible roles in neural development and function.RESULTS: A total of 4164 peptides were identified and quantified, and 262 of them were differentially expressed (absolute fold change ?2.5), including 164 upregulated peptides and 98 downregulated peptides. The numbers of differentially expressed peptides of the precursor proteins ELN, PCLO, MYO15a, MAP4, and MAP1b were the most, and may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of premature white matter injury. CDK5 signaling pathway in the hippocampus was activated in the rat model of premature white matter injury.CONCLUSIONS: The differentially expressed peptides related to precursor proteins such as MAP1b may be key bioactive peptides involved in neural development and function in premature white matter injury, and activation of the CDK5 signaling pathway may be associated with premature white matter injury. labels: #Animals#Animals, Newborn#Brain#Female#Hippocampus#Pregnancy#Premature Birth#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#White Matter'
b'The aim of this research is to investigate the application value of TTE in the diagnosis of the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA).The echocardiographic findings of 11 patients with ALCAPA confirmed by surgery in our hospital from October 2007 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) diagnosis and intraoperative diagnosis.Surgery was performed in all of the patients to establish the dual coronary artery system. Four underwent the Takeuchi procedure and 7 had re-implantation of the anomalous left coronary artery. The CTA diagnoses of the 11 patients were consistent with the surgical diagnoses, and the diagnostic accuracy was 100% (11/11). Echocardiographic diagnosis showed consistent results in 10 cases, while one case was misdiagnosed as endocardial fibroelastosis; the diagnostic accuracy was 90.9% (10/11). The echocardiographic features of these patients with ALCAPA included: abnormal left coronary ostium arising from the pulmonary trunk with retrograde coronary artery flow in 10 patients; enlargement of the right coronary artery in 8 patients; abundant intercoronary septal collaterals in 6 patients; and moderate and significant mitral regurgitation in 7 patients. Echocardiography showed that the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter before surgery were significantly different from those after surgery (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a<\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.05) and that the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening before surgery were not significantly different from those after surgery (P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a>\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.05).Transthoracic echocardiography can diagnose ALCAPA in a timely, accurate, and noninvasive manner, and it could be of great significance in guiding clinical operations and in predicting prognosis. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bland White Garland Syndrome#Child#Child, Preschool#Echocardiography#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'Metanteon poirieri sp. nov. (Hymenoptera: Dryinidae: Anteoninae) is described from New Caledonia. The genus Metanteon Olmi, 1984, was known only from the southern region of Argentina and Chile. The unique species attributed previously to this genus is M. aerias (Walker, 1839), collected in Chile by Charles Darwin during his famous trip on the HMS Beagle. M. aerias is associated only with leafhoppers feeding on Southern Beeches (Nothofagus spp.), a genus of Nothofagaceae including species of trees and shrubs native to the southern Hemisphere in southern South America (Argentina, Chile) and Australasia (east and southeast Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia).
