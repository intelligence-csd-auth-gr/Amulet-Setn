b'Objective: To explore the resistance mechanism and gene type of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn care unit. Methods: A total of 27 CRKP strains were primarily isolated from 22 patients [20 males, 2 females, aged (42\\xc2\\xb116) years] admitted to burn care unit of Institute of Burn Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University, hereinafter referred to as our department) from January to December 2017. After identification of bacteria, the months of detection and distribution of sample source were analyzed. Drug resistance tests of 15 antibiotics were conducted. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the drug resistant genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used to analyze the gene type of strains. Results: (1) During the whole year of 2017, CRKP strains were mostly detected in August (8 strains), September (6 strains), and October (5 strains), with no CRKP in January, March, June, November, and December. Five strains from bed units were detected in August (2 strains), September (1 strain), and October (2 strains). (2) Twenty-seven CRKP strains were derived from blood samples (40.7%, 11/27), wound exudate samples (18.5%, 5/27), deep vein catheter samples (11.1%, 3/27), sputum samples (7.4%, 2/27), urine samples (3.7%, 1/27), and bed unit samples (18.5%, 5/27). (3) The 27 CRKP strains were detected with drug-resistance rates of 100.0% to 7 antibiotics including cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ertapenem, and compound sulfamethoxazole, no drug-resistance to tigecycline, with drug-resistance rates higher than 81.0% to the rest 7 antibiotics. (4) Detection rates for resistance gene bla(CTX-M-10), bla(SHV), bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(ACT), and bla(KPC) were all above 92.5%. (5) According to PFGE, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 types (A, A(1), A(2), B, C, and D). Strains of type A were mainly detected in February, May, and September, with detection rate of 37.0% (10/27). Strains of type C were mainly detected in July, August, and October, with detection rate of 48.1% (13/27). Strains of types A(1), A(2), B, and D were scatteredly detected, with detection rate of 3.7% (1/27) respectively. According to MLST, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 STs. ST11 was the most frequent type, accounting for 74.1% (20/27), which was detected in August to October. The detection rate of ST395, ST2230, ST215, ST260, and STnew ranged from 3.7%(1/27) to 7.4%(2/27), and the strains were scatteredly detected. Conclusions: The main source of CRKP from burn care unit of our department was bloodstream. All the CRKP strains showed high drug-resistance rate and complicated resistance mechanism. There were small scale outbreaks caused by CRKP of type A, type C, and ST11, which should be paid more attention to in clinical treatment and infection control. labels: #Adult#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Burn Units#Burns#Carbapenems#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Female#Humans#Klebsiella Infections#Klebsiella pneumoniae#Male#Microbial Sensitivity Tests#Middle Aged#Multilocus Sequence Typing#beta-Lactamases'
b'Gold nanorods have shown to pose adverse effects to biota. Whether these effects may be potentiated through prolonged exposure has been rarely studied. Therefore, this work aimed at evaluating the effects of long-term exposure to sublethal levels of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) coated gold nanorods (Au-NR) on two freshwater microalgae: Chlorella vulgaris and Raphidocelis subcapitata. These algae were exposed to several concentrations of Au-NR for 72\\xe2\\x80\\xafh and, afterwards, to the corresponding EC5,72h, for growth, during 16\\xe2\\x80\\xafdays. The sensitivity of the two algae to Au-NR was assessed at days 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 (D0, D4, D8, D12 and D16, respectively) after a 72-h exposure to several concentrations of Au-NR. At the end of the assays, effects on yield and population growth rate were evaluated. Raphidocelis subcapitata was slightly more sensitive to Au-NR than C. vulgaris: EC50,72h,D0 for yield were 48.1 (35.3-60.9) and 70.5 (52.4-88.6) \\xc3\\xacg/L Au-NR, respectively while for population growth rate were above the highest tested concentrations (53 and 90\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc3\\xacg/L, respectively). For R. subcapitata the long-term exposure to Au-NR increased its sensitivity to this type of nanostructures. For C. vulgaris, a decrease on the effects caused by Au-NR occurred over time, with no significant effects being observed for yield or population growth rate at D12 and D16. The capping agent CTAB caused reductions in yield above 30% (D0) for both algae at the concentration matching the one at the highest Au-NR tested concentration. When exposed to CTAB, the highest inhibition values were 69% (D4) and 21.3% (D8) for R. subcapitata, and 64% (D12) and 21% (D16) to C. vulgaris, for yield and population growth rate, respectively. These results suggested long-term exposures should be included in ecological risk assessments since short-term standard toxicity may either under- or overestimate the risk posed by Au-NR. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In the present work, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have been developed for ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals on four different aquatic species namely Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Daphnia magna, Oncorhynchus mykiss and Pimephales promelas using genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection followed by Partial Least Squares regression technique according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Double cross-validation methodology was employed for selecting suitable models. Only 2D descriptors were used for capturing chemical information and model building, whereas validation of the models was performed by considering various stringent internal and external validation metrics. Interestingly, models could be developed even without using any LogP terms in contrary to the usual dependence of toxicity on lipophilicity. However, the current manuscript proposes highly robust and more predictive models employing computed logP descriptors. The applicability domain study was performed in order to set a predefined chemical zone of applicability for the obtained QSAR models, and the test compounds falling outside the domain were not taken for further analysis while making a prioritized list. An additional comparison was made with ECOSAR, an online expert system for toxicity prediction of organic pollutants, in order to prove predictability of the obtained models. The obtained robust consensus models were utilized to predict the toxicity of a large dataset of approximately 9300 drug-like molecules in order to prioritize the existing drug-like substances in accordance to their acute predicted aquatic toxicities following a scaling technique. Finally, prioritized lists of 500 most toxic chemicals obtained by respective consensus models and those predicted from ECOSAR tool have been reported. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective To investigate the role and mechanism of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in alcohol-induced inflammation and permeability of intestinal epithelial cells. Methods To select the proper concentration of alcohol, differentiated Caco-2 cells were treated with different concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mmol/L) of alcohol, and then cell viability was assayed by MTT assay; the mRNA and protein levels of HDAC3 were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were divided into three groups: control group, alcohol group (treatment with 50 mmol/L alcohol for 60 minutes), and alcohol combined with HDAC3 inhibitor group (pretreatment with 2 \\xc3\\xacmol/L RGFP966 1 hour before alcohol). ELISA was performed to detect tumor necrosis factor \\xc3\\xa1 (TNF-\\xc3\\xa1) level in cell supernatant. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured using a resistance meter. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels relevant to tight junction (occludin and claudin-1) and NF-\\xc3\\xaaB activation (I\\xc3\\xaaB and phosphorylated NF-\\xc3\\xaaBp65). Results Alcohol at 10, 25 and 50 mmol/L did not affect cell viability. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HDAC3 increased in a dose-dependent manner after alcohol treatment at these concentration s. Compared with the control group, TNF-\\xc3\\xa1 and phosphorylated NF-\\xc3\\xaaBp65 levels increased, whereas TER and protein levels of occludin, claudin-1 and I\\xc3\\xaaB decreased in the alcohol group. Compared with the alcohol group, TNF-\\xc3\\xa1 and phosphorylated NF-\\xc3\\xaaBp65 levels were reduced, while TER and protein levels of occludin, claudin-1 and I\\xc3\\xaaB were elevated in the alcohol combined with HDAC3 inhibitor group. Conclusion HDAC3 inhibition can attenuate alcohol-induced inflammation and permeability of intestinal epithelial cells, which may be related to the inactivation of NF-\\xc3\\xaaB. labels: #Caco-2 Cells#Claudin-1#Ethanol#Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors#Histone Deacetylases#Humans#I-kappa B Proteins#Inflammation#Intestinal Mucosa#Occludin#Transcription Factor RelA#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha'
b'Objective: To investigate the expression of fragile-site associated tumor suppressor (FATS) in non-small cell lung cancer and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Methods: A total of 140 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 30 adjacent normal tissues were used to detect the expression level of FATS protein, and to analyze the relationship of FATS protein expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of NSCLC. Results: Western blot showed that the expression of FATS in adjacent normal tissues was significantly higher than that in non-small cell lung cancer tissues. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the high expression rate of FATS in 140 cases of NSCLC was 40.0%, and the high expression rate of FATS in 30 cases of adjacent tissues was 73.3%. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.01). Further analysis showed that the TNM stage (P=0.044) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.022) were significant difference between FATS high expression group and low expression group. The 6-year overall survival (OS) rates of NSCLC patients with FATS high-expression and low-expression were 57.1% and 23.8%, respectively, and the 6-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 53.6% and 21.4%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P=0.001). In Cox multivariate analysis, we found gender (HR=1.658, P=0.028; HR=1.684, P=0.023), TNM staging (HR=2.327, P=0.019; HR=2.332, P=0.013) and FATS expression (HR=0.532, P=0.010; HR=0.538, P=0.009) were independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS of NSCLC patients. Conclusions: The expression of FATS protein is associated with the development and is an independent prognostic factor of NSCLC patients. The detection of FATS protein is expected to be a new biomarker for evaluating the prognosis of NSCLC patients. labels: #Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Cytoskeletal Proteins#Humans#Kaplan-Meier Estimate#Lung Neoplasms#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis'
b'A large body of evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as expression and function of retinoid receptors, are pivotal features of tumor initiation, progression, and chemoresistance. This is also true for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which represents a clinical challenge due to poor prognosis and increasing incidence. Understanding the above features of cancer cells could open new avenues for PDAC treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between CSCs, EMT, and retinoid receptors in PDAC after treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents - gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil. First, we demonstrated the difference in the expression levels of CSC and EMT markers and retinoid receptors in the untreated Mia PaCa-2 and Panc1 cells that also differed in the frequency of spontaneous apoptosis and distribution between the cell cycle phases. Chemotherapy reduced the number of cancer cells in the S phase. Gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil modulated expression of CSC markers, E-cadherin, and RXR\\xc3\\xa2 in Panc1 but not in Mia PaCa-2 cells. We suggest that these effects could be attributed to the difference in the basal levels of expression of the investigated genes. The obtained data could be interesting in the context of future preclinical research. labels: #Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic#Apoptosis#Cadherins#Cell Line, Tumor#Deoxycytidine#Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition#Fluorouracil#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Humans#Neoplastic Stem Cells#Retinoid X Receptor beta#S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints'
b'PURPOSE: The purpose of the present systematic review was to investigate at the histological level if a modified titanium surface abutment could affect the behaviour of soft peri-implant tissue (connective tissue adhesion and soft tissue inflammation).MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic databases research (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) until 24 June 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI) was performed. The focused question was: "In healthy patients with at least one titanium healing abutment connected to a dental implant, is the effect of a healing abutment surface modification different from machined titanium at the histological level?" The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess the risk of bias in individual studies was used for RCTs. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used to evaluate NRSI.RESULTS: In total, 192 records were evaluated for titles and abstracts. Seven studies were included in the review. Five of them reported an enhanced soft tissue adhesion in the modified abutment group without increasing the soft tissue inflammation. One study reported no significant differences among titanium-modified (double acid-etched) and titanium-machined groups. One author demonstrated at the 6-month follow-up period a higher level of inflammation around acid-etched surfaces, with a higher number of T and B lymphocytes and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term data (< 6 months) suggested an enhanced connective fibre attachment next to titanium abutments with a modified surface and a similar inflammatory response, in comparison with machined surface titanium abutments. However, modified surfaces may lead to a long-term increased risk of a higher degree of inflammation in the peri-implant tissues. Due to limited available evidence, further long-term studies are needed to confirm these results. labels: #Dental Abutments#Dental Implants#Humans#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Titanium#Tooth#Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A'
b'Objective To develop the colloidal gold immunochromatography test strip for qualitatively detecting the hemoglobin (Hb) in human feces. Methods Mouse anti-human Hb monoclonal antibody SPR-5 marked by colloidal gold was coated in glass fiber membrane, and then the mouse anti-human Hb SP-5 monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG were immobilized in testing (T) line and control (C) line located in nitrocellulose membranes, respectively. With this double antibody sandwich technique and immunochromatography test, the Hb antigen would react with both antibodies coated in the T line and C line and cause two colour reactions if the detected sample was positive, whereas the antigen-antibody combination and colour reaction only showed up in the C line when the sample was negative. Results The minimum detection limit of this test strip for human Hb was 21 ng/mL and no cross reactions were found in chick Hb, rabbit Hb, sheep Hb, pig Hb and cow Hb. Conclusion The test strips can improve the detection rate of fecal occult blood obviously and avoid false-positive results. labels: #Animals#Antibodies, Monoclonal#Cattle#Chromatography, Affinity#Cross Reactions#Female#Gold Colloid#Humans#Occult Blood#Rabbits#Reagent Strips#Sensitivity and Specificity#Sheep#Species Specificity#Swine'
b'In this study, it was found that fulvic acid (FA) enhanced the contents of astaxanthin and lipids in Haematococcus pluvialis under high light and nitrogen starvation conditions by 2- and 1.2-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, the carbohydrate and chlorophyll contents were decreased by FA induction, whereas the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) as well as the expression of astaxanthin and lipid biosynthetic genes were increased. To further explore the interrelation between FA and the biosynthesis of astaxanthin and lipids, a metabolomics analysis of H. pluvialis by combined FA and abiotic stress exposure was conducted by using LC-MS/MS. The contents of some cytoprotective metabolites and signal molecules, including d-maltose, succinate, malic acid, melatonin (MT), and some amino acids, were increased under FA induction and abiotic stress conditions. These metabolites are intermediates in the TCA cycle and Calvin cycle, providing more precursors for the synthesis of astaxanthin and lipids. Moreover, the signal molecules might contribute to enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance. This study provided new insights into the regulatory mechanism of FA on astaxanthin and lipid accumulation in H. pluvialis. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Snow algae can form large-scale blooms across the snowpack surface and near-surface environments. These pigmented blooms can decrease snow albedo and increase local melt rates, and they may impact the global heat budget and water cycle. Yet, the underlying causes for the geospatial occurrence of these blooms remain unconstrained. One possible factor contributing to snow algal blooms is the presence of mineral dust as a micronutrient source. We investigated the bioavailability of iron (Fe)-bearing minerals, including forsterite (Fo90, Mg1.8Fe0.2SiO4), goethite, smectite, and pyrite as Fe sources for a Chloromonas brevispina-bacterial coculture through laboratory-based experimentation. Fo90 was capable of stimulating snow algal growth and increased the algal growth rate in otherwise Fe-depleted cocultures. Fo90-bearing systems also exhibited a decrease in the ratio of bacteria to algae compared to those of Fe-depleted conditions, suggesting a shift in microbial community structure. The C. brevispina coculture also increased the rate of Fo90 dissolution relative to that of an abiotic control. Analysis of 16S rRNA genes in the coculture identified Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteria, all of which are commonly found in snow and ice environments. Archaea were not detected. Collimonas and Pseudomonas, which are known to enhance mineral weathering rates, comprised two of the top eight (>1%) operational taxonomic units (OTUs). These data provide unequivocal evidence that mineral dust can support elevated snow algal growth under otherwise Fe-depleted growth conditions and that snow algal microbial communities can enhance mineral dissolution under these conditions.IMPORTANCE Fe, a key micronutrient for photosynthetic growth, is necessary to support the formation of high-density snow algal blooms. The laboratory experiments described herein allow for a systematic investigation of the interactions of snow algae, bacteria, and minerals and their ability to mobilize and uptake mineral-bound Fe. Results provide unequivocal and comprehensive evidence that mineral-bound Fe in Fe-bearing Fo90 was bioavailable to Chloromonas brevispina snow algae within an algal-bacterial coculture. This evidence includes (i) an observed increase in snow algal density and growth rate, (ii) decreased ratios of bacteria to algae in Fo90-containing cultures relative to those of cultures grown under similarly Fe-depleted conditions with no mineral-bound Fe present, and (iii) increased Fo90 dissolution rates in the presence of algal-bacterial cocultures relative to those of abiotic mineral controls. These results have important implications for the role of mineral dust in supplying micronutrients to the snow microbiome, which may help support dense snow algal blooms capable of lowering snow albedo and increasing snow melt rates on regional, and possibly global, scales. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'During August 9-October 31, 2019, 96 patients were classified as having e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH); other patients are being investigated for case classification and exposures. Among 58 patients interviewed, 53 (91%) reported obtaining tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products from informal sources such as friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), the MDH Public Health Laboratory (PHL) analyzed 46 THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from 12 EVALI patients for various potential toxicants, including vitamin E acetate, which has recently been detected in some THC-containing products and in samples of lung fluid from EVALI patients (1-4). To explore whether vitamin E acetate is a recently added component in THC-containing products, MDH tested ten products seized by law enforcement in 2018, before the EVALI outbreak, and 20 products seized in 2019, during the outbreak. Twenty-four products obtained from 11 EVALI patients from 2019 contained vitamin E acetate. Among the seized products tested by MDH, none seized in 2018 contained vitamin E acetate, although all tested THC-containing products seized in 2019 tested positive for vitamin E acetate. These chemical analyses of products obtained from EVALI patients and of products intended for the illicit market both before and during the outbreak support a potential role for vitamin E acetate in the EVALI outbreak; however, the number of products tested was small, and further research is needed to establish a causal link between exposure to inhaled vitamin E acetate and EVALI. Collaboration between public health jurisdictions and law enforcement to characterize THC-containing products circulating before the recognition of the EVALI outbreak and during the outbreak might provide valuable information about a dynamic market. These Minnesota findings highlight concerns about e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC acquired from informal sources. Because local supply chains and policy environments vary, CDC continues to recommend not using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC or any e-cigarette, or vaping, products obtained from informal sources. E-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or pregnant women.* Until the relationship between inhaled vitamin E acetate and lung health is better characterized, vitamin E acetate should not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping, products. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Dronabinol#Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems#Female#Humans#Law Enforcement#Legislation, Drug#Lung Injury#Male#Middle Aged#Minnesota#Vaping#Vitamin E#Young Adult'
b'The aim of this research is to investigate the application value of TTE in the diagnosis of the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA).The echocardiographic findings of 11 patients with ALCAPA confirmed by surgery in our hospital from October 2007 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) diagnosis and intraoperative diagnosis.Surgery was performed in all of the patients to establish the dual coronary artery system. Four underwent the Takeuchi procedure and 7 had re-implantation of the anomalous left coronary artery. The CTA diagnoses of the 11 patients were consistent with the surgical diagnoses, and the diagnostic accuracy was 100% (11/11). Echocardiographic diagnosis showed consistent results in 10 cases, while one case was misdiagnosed as endocardial fibroelastosis; the diagnostic accuracy was 90.9% (10/11). The echocardiographic features of these patients with ALCAPA included: abnormal left coronary ostium arising from the pulmonary trunk with retrograde coronary artery flow in 10 patients; enlargement of the right coronary artery in 8 patients; abundant intercoronary septal collaterals in 6 patients; and moderate and significant mitral regurgitation in 7 patients. Echocardiography showed that the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter before surgery were significantly different from those after surgery (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05) and that the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening before surgery were not significantly different from those after surgery (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05).Transthoracic echocardiography can diagnose ALCAPA in a timely, accurate, and noninvasive manner, and it could be of great significance in guiding clinical operations and in predicting prognosis. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bland White Garland Syndrome#Child#Child, Preschool#Echocardiography#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'Microalgal toxicity tests using integrative endpoints as algal growth are regularly required to analyse the toxicity of potentially hazardous substances in the aquatic environment. However, these do not provide mechanistic information on the toxic mode of action by which contaminants may affect algae. Bottled waters can be used as a substitute for culturing media and should not impose any stress to the cultured organisms. However, certain chemical components can interfere with specific cell targets which are not revealed by general toxicity assays. The present study investigated the sensitivity of flow cytometry (FCM) to analyse sub-lethal effects of different bottled waters to the freshwater microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata. Several endpoints were analysed including growth rate, natural pigments content, cell size, complexity, viability and cycle, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane potential and Lipid Peroxidation (LPO). Additionally, photosystem II (PSII) performance was analysed by PAM fluorometry, to provide further information on the absorption, distribution and use of energy in photosynthesis. Results indicated that the most sensitive endpoints were the oxidative stress related endpoints ROS formation and LPO, pigment content, morphological endpoints as cell size, complexity and cycle, with growth rate being one of the least sensitive. Although being essential macronutrients for algal growth, the chemical elements Ca, Na, Mg, and NH4 were identified as being primarily responsible for the observed toxicological effects to exposed algae. The applied methodology proved to be of high throughput, simultaneously assembling information on morphological, biochemical, and physiological status of algal cells. FCM also showed potential to reveal mechanistic information on the toxic mode of action of the bottled waters before any effects on algal growth was observed. The used approach demonstrated its potential for being integrated into future microalgal toxicity bioassays for testing chemicals to improve the hazard information obtained from currently approved internationally accepted test guidelines. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Here, we investigate the unfolding behavior of a streptomycin-binding ribonucleic acid (RNA) aptamer under application of force in shear geometry. Using Langevin out-of-equilibrium simulations to emulate the single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiment, we were able to understand the hierarchical unfolding process that occurs in the RNA molecule under application of stretching force and the influence of streptomycin modifying this unfolding. Subsequently, the application of the Jarzynski equality to the force profiles obtained in the pulling simulations shows that the free energies for individual systems and the difference of unfolding free energy upon streptomycin binding to the RNA free aptamer are in fair agreement with the experimental values, obtained through SMFS by Nick et al.

b'Objective: To investigate the therapeutic strategy in patients with early gastric cancer after noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Methods: A total of 107 cases with early gastric cancer receiving noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection were collected and the patients were classified into an additional gastrectomy group (n=41) and a simple follow-up group (n=66) according to the therapeutic method used after noncurative ESD. The clinicopathological information, short- and long-term clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The mean age of the patients in the gastrectomy group and follow-up group was(59.2\\xc2\\xb18.7)years old and(64.7\\xc2\\xb18.8)years old, respectively. The depth of submucosal invasion was (1445.83\\xc2\\xb1803.12) and (794.71\\xc2\\xb1815.79) \\xc3\\xacm, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.020 for age and P=0.010 for depth of submucosal invasion). Compared with follow-up group, the patients with undifferentiated histologic type, deep invasion of submucosa (SM2), diffuse type, lymphovascular invasion and neural invasion were more common in the gastrectomy group (P<0.05). The R0 resection rate of ESD in the gastrectomy group was significantly lower than the follow-up group(26.8% vs 65.2%, P<0.001). The positive residual tumor rate and LNM rate of additional gastrectomy group were 31.7%(13/41)and 9.76%(4/41)according to the pathological results after gastrectomy. The gastrectomy group had 2 cases of local recurrence (2/41, 4.9%), while 5(5/66, 7.6%)in the follow-up group(4.9% vs 7.6%, P=0.883). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the two study groups (P=0.066 and 0.938, respectively). Conclusions: Assessment of LNM risk should be performed in patients with noncurative endoscopic resection. For patients with low risk of LNM who are intolerance of additional gastrectomy due to old age and comorbidities, close follow-up with endoscopy can be considered as an alternative. labels: #Aged#Disease-Free Survival#Endoscopic Mucosal Resection#Gastrectomy#Humans#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Retrospective Studies#Stomach Neoplasms#Survival Rate#Treatment Outcome'
b'A method to simultaneously extract polar (PC) and non-polar compounds (NPC) from microalgae was developed for further determination of intracellular metabolites by gas chromatography. The proposed method was validated and used to characterize two Chlorophyceae, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus, and two Cyanobacteria, Aphanothece microscopica Nag?li and Phormidium autumnale. The compounds were extracted with a reduced amount of organic solvent mixture (methanol-chloroform), compared to the reference method, under different conditions of homogenization and/or cell disruption. The NPC were derivatized by acid catalysis, whereas the PC fraction was derivatized using N-methyl,N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) in alkaline medium. The following parameters for method validation were considered: selectivity, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), precision, and accuracy. All methods of homogenization and cell disruption extracted both PC and NPC from Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Derivatization of PC presented satisfactory validation parameters. Eleven fatty acids, six free amino acids, and three organic acids were found within the evaluated microalgae species, succinic, malic, and citric acids, important intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glutamic acid was the amino acid found in greatest quantities in all species. Chlorophyceae presented a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, while Cyanobacteria had more saturated fatty acids. Thus, the proposed method was suitable to metabolically characterize both PC and NPC from microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'BACKGROUND: \\xc3\\xb9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are synthesized from \\xc3\\xa1-Linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3\\xc3\\xb93) and play important roles in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in mammal cells. ALA is an essential fatty acid which cannot be produced within the human body and must be acquired through diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel microalgal strain (HDMA-20) as a source of \\xc3\\xb9-3 PUFAs including ALA and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, C20:4\\xc3\\xb93).METHOD: Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequence was used to identify the microalga strain HDMA-20. Autotrophic condition was chosen to cultivate HDMA-20 to reduce the cultivation cost. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty acid composition of HDMA-20 lipid.RESULTS: A microalgal strain (HDMA-20) from Lake Chengfeng (Daqing, Heilongjiang province, China) was found to accumulate high content of \\xc3\\xb9-3 PUFAs (63.4% of total lipid), with ALA and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, C20:4\\xc3\\xb93) accounting for 35.4 and 9.6% of total lipid, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences suggested that the HDMA-20 belonged to genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S rDNA sequence information turned out to be new molecular record of Monoraphidium species. The biomass productivity and lipid content of HDMA-20 were also investigated under autotrophic condition. The biomass productivity of HDMA-20 reached 36.3\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg\\xe2\\x80\\x89L-\\xe2\\x80\\x891\\xe2\\x80\\x89day-\\xe2\\x80\\x891, and the lipid contents was 22.6% of dry weight.CONCLUSION: HDMA-20 not only represent an additional source of ALA, but also a totally new source of ETA. The high content of \\xc3\\xb9-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, of HDMA-20, makes it suitable as a source of nutrition supplements for human health. In addition, HDMA-20 exhibited good properties in growth and lipid accumulation, implying its potential for cost-effective \\xc3\\xb9-3 PUFAs production in future. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at a higher risk of development of lung cancer. Frequent exacerbations of COPD trigger the disease course to chronic inflammation which likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Previous studies showed influenza virus infection is one of important causes for exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to know whether influenza vaccination could reduce the incidence of lung cancer in patients with COPD.This cohort study enrolled patients (?55 years old) with a recorded diagnosis of COPD between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012 by using the Taiwan Health Insurance Database. A propensity score was calculated to reduce vaccine therapy selection bias. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to investigate the association between the influenza vaccination and lung cancer incidence after adjusting for known confounding factors. Besides, we categorized the patients into 4 groups according to vaccination status (unvaccinated, total number of vaccinations: 1, 2-3, ?4) to evaluate the dose-dependent effect on reducing lung cancer occurrence of lung cancer in COPD patients.Our study comprised of 28,752 eligible individuals from the COPD cohort database. Among them, 51% (14,630) received influenza vaccination; the rest (49%) of the COPD patients did not receive influenza vaccination. We observed that COPD patients receiving influenza vaccination had a lower risk of lung cancer (adjusted HR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.40, 95% CI (0.35-0.45), P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). We also founded comparable protective effect in both sexes and all age groups (55-64, 65-74, ?75) regardless of influenza seasonality. Furthermore, dose-dependent protective effect could be seen after stratifying patients according to the total number vaccinations, the adjusted HRs for lung cancer risk were 0.48 (0.40-0.54) and 0.24 (0.20-0.29) for patients who received 2 to 3 and ?4 vaccinations during the follow-up period.This population-based cohort study demonstrated that annual influenza vaccination administration could reduce incidence of lung cancer in COPD patients. labels: #Aged#Cohort Studies#Disease Progression#Female#Humans#Immunization Schedule#Incidence#Influenza Vaccines#Influenza, Human#Lung Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive'
b'The biosorption properties of water-soluble radioactive cesium (137Cs) by microalga Haematococcus pluvialis were evaluated with different cell conditions, and its cesium-uptake rate was compared with that by other microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris and Anabaena sp. Photo-induced H. pluvialis red cyst rapidly removed radioactive cesium from the solution by bioaccumulation. We showed that the effectiveness of 137Cs uptake is dependent on the specific cell condition of even the same microalgal species. While the H. pluvialis red cyst removed almost 95% of the soluble 137Cs in 48\\xe2\\x80\\xafh, both H. pluvialis intermediate cells and C. vulgaris showed 90% uptake efficiency of 137Cs with slow uptake rate. The energy dispersive spectrometer data demonstrated that the cesium uptake acceleration by inducing astaxanthin in H. pluvialis red cyst involves the cesium accumulation through the potassium transport channel. The long-term monitoring experiments of the cesium uptake showed that only 40% of 137Cs remained in collapsed H. pluvialis cell fragments after 12 months. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae cultivation in wastewater media in phototrophic condition is a promising approach for integrated CO2 biofixation and wastewater treatment. For this, Neochloris oleoabundans was used to investigate the tertiary treatment of wastewater along with CO2 biofixation. In this investigation, biomass productivity, CO2 biofixation rate and percentage of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) removal from synthetic wastewater are considered under three different operating conditions: temperature, CO2 feed concentration and nitrogen to phosphorus (NP) ratio in the media. Cultivation of N. oleoabundans was found to be highly temperature sensitive. With the increase of cultivation temperature from 25 to 45\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb0C, declining trends of biomass concentration, productivity and percentage of TN and TP removal were observed. Cultivation temperature of 25\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb0C was found to be most favorable in terms of biomass productivity, CO2 biofixation rate, percentage of TN and TP removal of 92 (mg L-1\\xc2\\xa0day-1), 145 (mg L-1\\xc2\\xa0day-1), 100% and 32%, respectively. Arrhenius-type kinetic model was used and the model showed good agreement with the experimental findings. Activation energy for the active stage and decay stage was found to be [Formula: see text]\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x8988.8 kJ\\xc2\\xa0mol-1 and [Formula: see text]\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x898.4 kJ\\xc2\\xa0mol-1, respectively. With the increase of CO2 feed concentration, biomass productivity increased and the maximum biomass concentration and productivity was achieved at 6%. After that with the increase in CO2, a declining trend was observed. With the increase of NP ratio from 1:1 to 2:1, both the biomass productivity and CO2 biofixation were increased, but later were subsequently decreased with increase of NP ratio from 4:1 to 8:1. It is interesting that TP removal was increased with NP ratio and 100 percent of TP removal was achieved at 4:1 and 8:1 conditions. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Introduction: According to the Hungarian law, placental examination is not mandatory, although it is known from the international practice that it can give valuable information in cases of stillbirth or in conditions, where the neonate has difficulty in the postnatal adaptation. Aim: It can be useful in the early detection of diseases, which otherwise would have gone undetected until late in life. This article is unique in Hungary, as no similar guideline exists in Hungarian language. Method: The recommendation of the Royal College of Pathologists (United Kingdom) determines those conditions where essential information can be obtained from the placental examination in not normal pregnancies. It serves as a useful guide in the medical practice. The journal titled "Placenta", first published in 1980 with impact factor above two, just underlines this statement. Results: In this article, the authors present the recent guideline of the RCPath and finish with the presentation of established clinicopathological association that might help clinicians to get the most valuable information from placental examination. Conclusion: The present article aims to summarise updated recommendations and present clinicopathological correlations.

b'Microalgae are key test organisms to assess the effects of chemicals on aquatic ecosystems. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as a widely used metal oxide is considered a potential threat to these primary producers at the base of the food chain. This study investigates the toxicity of ZnO NPs, bulk ZnO, and Zn2+ to the representative of freshwater microalgae, Raphidocelis subcapitata. To examine the effect of shape and size of nanoparticles, two types of spherical ZnO NPs with different sizes (20 and 40\\xc2\\xa0nm) and two types of rod-shaped ZnO NPs with different lengths (100 and 500\\xc2\\xa0nm) were synthesized. Microalgal cells were exposed to eight concentrations of each ZnO NP type from 0.01 to 0.7\\xc2\\xa0mg/L for 96\\xc2\\xa0h. The results showed that 0.7\\xc2\\xa0mg/L of ZnO NP could completely inhibit algal growth. Size did not interfere with toxicity in spherical ZnO NPs, but the toxicity decreased by increasing the size of rod-shaped ZnO NPs. Spherical ZnO NPs acted more destructive to microalgal cells than nanorod shape. The addition of 0.7\\xc2\\xa0mg/L of ZnO nanorods to samples caused 30% cell death, while 50% cell death was observed by adding the same concentration of nanospherical ZnO. Nano ZnO revealed to be more toxic than bulk ZnO and Zn2+. The Zn2+ released from dissolution of ZnO NPs was one of the sources of toxicity, but the ZnO nanostructures were also an important factor in the toxicity. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Arctic is being disproportionally affected by climate change compared with other geographic locations, and is currently experiencing unprecedented melt rates. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) can be regarded as the largest supraglacial ecosystem on Earth, and ice algae are the dominant primary producers on bare ice surfaces throughout the course of a melt season. Ice-algal-derived pigments cause a darkening of the ice surface, which in turn decreases albedo and increases melt rates. The important role of ice algae in changing melt rates has only recently been recognized, and we currently know little about their community compositions and functions. Here, we present the first analysis of ice algal communities across a 100\\xe2\\x80\\x89km transect on the GrIS by high-throughput sequencing and subsequent oligotyping of the most abundant taxa. Our data reveal an extremely low algal diversity with Ancylonema nordenski?ldii and a Mesotaenium species being by far the dominant taxa at all sites. We employed an oligotyping approach and revealed a hidden diversity not detectable by conventional clustering of operational taxonomic units and taxonomic classification. Oligotypes of the dominant taxa exhibit a site-specific distribution, which may be linked to differences in temperatures and subsequently the extent of the melting. Our results help to better understand the distribution patterns of ice algal communities that play a crucial role in the GrIS ecosystem. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: The development of these guidelines is sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres with published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Methods: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines for guidelines protocols. Results: The Executive Summary of this 2019 updated guideline contains 58 numbered recommendations: 12 are Grade A (21%), 19 are Grade B (33%), 21 are Grade C (36%), and 6 are Grade D (10%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the subsequent Appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update contains 357 citations of which 51 (14%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (strong), 168 (47%) are EL 2 (intermediate), 61 (17%) are EL 3 (weak), and 77 (22%) are EL 4 (no clinical evidence). Conclusion: This CPG is a practical tool that practicing endocrinologists and regulatory bodies can refer to regarding the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult-care services with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). It provides guidelines on assessment, screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment recommendations for a range of individuals with various causes of adult GHD. The recommendations emphasize the importance of considering testing patients with a reasonable level of clinical suspicion of GHD using appropriate growth hormone (GH) cut-points for various GH-stimulation tests to accurately diagnose adult GHD, and to exercise caution interpreting serum GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, as various GH and IGF-1 assays are used to support treatment decisions. The intention to treat often requires sound clinical judgment and careful assessment of the benefits and risks specific to each individual patient. Unapproved uses of GH, long-term safety, and the current status of long-acting GH preparations are also discussed in this document. LAY ABSTRACT This updated guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the identification, screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for a range of individuals with various causes of adult growth-hormone deficiency (GHD) and patients with childhood-onset GHD transitioning to adult care. The update summarizes the most current knowledge about the accuracy of available GH-stimulation tests, safety of recombinant human GH (rhGH) replacement, unapproved uses of rhGH related to sports and aging, and new developments such as long-acting GH preparations that use a variety of technologies to prolong GH action. Recommendations offer a framework for physicians to manage patients with GHD effectively during transition to adult care and adulthood. Establishing a correct diagnosis is essential before consideration of replacement therapy with rhGH. Since the diagnosis of GHD in adults can be challenging, GH-stimulation tests are recommended based on individual patient circumstances and use of appropriate GH cut-points. Available GH-stimulation tests are discussed regarding variability, accuracy, reproducibility, safety, and contraindications, among other factors. The regimen for starting and maintaining rhGH treatment now uses individualized dose adjustments, which has improved effectiveness and reduced reported side effects, dependent on age, gender, body mass index, and various other individual characteristics. With careful dosing of rhGH replacement, many features of adult GHD are reversible and side effects of therapy can be minimized. Scientific studies have consistently shown rhGH therapy to be beneficial for adults with GHD, including improvements in body composition and quality of life, and have demonstrated the safety of short- and long-term rhGH replacement.

b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of calcium-sensitive receptors (CaSR) on the expression of 11\\xc3\\xa2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2) and cortisol concentration in a neonatal mouse model of persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH).METHODS: Fifty-six newborn C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a control group (n=14), a PPH group (n=14), an agonist group (n=14), and an inhibitor group (n=14). The mice in the PPH, agonist, and inhibitor groups were exposed to a 12% oxygen concentration, and the agonist group and inhibitor group were given CaSR agonist (GdCl3, 16 mg/kg) and CaSR antagonist (NPS2390, 1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally once a day, respectively. The mice in control group were exposed to air, and then injected with an equal volume of normal saline as those in the PPH group every day. All mice were treated for 14 days. Morphological examination of heart and lung tissues was performed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expression levels of 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 mRNA and 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 protein in lung tissues were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cortisol levels in lung tissues were determined using ELISA.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the PPH group had significantly increased pulmonary artery wall thickness (WT%), ratio of right to left ventricular thickness (RV/LV), alveolar mean linear intercept, and BNP concentration and a significantly reduced radial alveolar count (P<0.05); compared with the PPH group, the agonist group showed significant increases in WT% and BNP concentration, while the inhibitor group showed significant reductions in the two indicators (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the PPH group showed significant reductions in the expression levels of 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 mRNA and 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 protein, but a significant increase in cortisol concentration (P<0.05); compared with the PPH group, the agonist group had significantly lower expression levels of 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 mRNA and 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 protein, but a significant higher cortisol concentration, while the inhibitor group showed opposite changes in these indicators (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: CaSR may control the development and progression of PPH in newborn mice by regulating the expression of 11\\xc3\\xa2-HSD2 and cortisol concentration. labels: #11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2#Animals#Animals, Newborn#Calcium#Hydrocortisone#Hypertension, Pulmonary#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Receptors, Calcium-Sensing'
b'Oxylipins (OXLs) are bioactive molecules generated by the oxidation of fatty acids that promote the resolution of acute inflammation and prevent chronic inflammatory processes through molecular mechanisms that are not well known. We have previously reported the anti-inflammatory activity of microalgae-derived OXLs and OXL-containing biomass in two inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced acute colitis and TNBS-induced recurrent colitis. In this study, we examined the in vitro anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of the most abundant OXLs isolated from Chlamydomonas debaryana (13S-HOTE and 13S-HODE) and Nannochloropsis gaditana (15S-HEPE). These OXLs decreased IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines production as well as iNOS and COX-2 expression levels in THP-1 macrophages. In addition, OXLs decreased IL-8 production in HT-29 colon cells, the major chemokine produced by these cells. The interaction of OXLs with NF\\xc3\\xaaB and PPAR-\\xc3\\xa3 signaling pathways was studied by confocal microscopy. In THP-1 macrophages and HT-29 colon cells, stimulated by LPS and TNF\\xc3\\xa1 respectively, a pre-treatment with 13S-HOTE, 13S-HODE and 15S-HEPE (100\\xc3\\xacM) resulted in a lower nuclear presence of NF\\xc3\\xaaB in both cell lines. The study of the subcellular localization of PPAR-\\xc3\\xa3 showed that the treatment of THP-1 and HT-29 cells with these OXLs caused the migration of PPAR-\\xc3\\xa3 into the nucleus. Colocalization analysis of both transcription factors in LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages showed that the pre-treatment with 13S-HOTE, 13S-HODE or 15S-HEPE lowered nuclear colocalization similar to control value, and increased cytosolic localization above control level. These results indicate that these OXLs could act as agonist of PPAR-\\xc3\\xa3 and consequently inhibit NF\\xc3\\xaaB signaling pathway activation, thus lowering the production of inflammatory markers, highlighting the therapeutic potential of these OXLs in inflammatory diseases such as IBD. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) serum on expression of myogenic differentiation antigen (Myod) and autophagy-related protein Beclin 1 in cultured muscle satellite cells of rats under starvation conditions.METHODS: The primary multifidus muscle satellite cells of one male SD rat were isolated and cultured to obtain the 3rd generation of cells. The EA serum was got from the rat received EA stimulation of bilateral "Weizhong" (BL40, 2 Hz/10 Hz, 1 mA, duration of 20 min, once daily for 7 days). The cell suspension (2?104/well) of the 3rd generation of cultured cells was transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Twelve duplicate wells were set up for the blank control serum (without FBS), 10% FBS, 10% EA serum, 20% EA serum and 30% EA serum groups and incubated for 12 h and 24 h, respectively. Each well was supplemented with 10 \\xc2\\xb5L CCK-8 reagent to be incubated for 1 h again for observing the state of cell proliferation. After culturing the primary muscle satellite cells in serum-free medium for 12 h, the cells were randomly divided into serum-free group, 10% fetal bovine serum group and optimal concentration electroacupuncture serum group, and serum of corresponding concentration was added respectively. The expression levels of Beclin 1 and cell-proliferation-related protein Myod were detected by Western blot.RESULTS: CCK-8 assay displayed that the proliferation levels were significantly higher at 12 h and 24 h after serum intervention in the 10% FBS, 10% EA serum, 20% EA serum and 30% EA serum groups than that in the blank control serum group (P<0.01), and at 24 h in the 3 EA serum groups than in the 10% FBS group (P<0.01), but without significant difference among the three EA serum groups (P>0.05). As a result, 10% EA serum was selected as the optimal concentration for Western blot tests. No significant difference was found in the expression levels of Myod and Beclin 1 proteins among the serum-free, 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups before intervention (P>0.05), and there was a marked up-regulation of Myod expression and an obvious down-regulation of Beclin 1 expression at 12 h in both the 10% EA serum and 10% FBS groups in comparison with their own pre-intervention (P<0.05). There were a marked up-re-gulation of Myod expression at both 12 h and 24 h and Beclin 1 expression at 24 h in both the 10% EA serum group and 10% FBS group than that in the serum-free group (P<0.05), and an obvious down-regulation of Beclin 1 expression at 12 h in both 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups than that in the serum-free group (P<0.05, P<0.01). After 24 h\\\'s serum intervention, there was an increase of Myod expression and a reduction of Beclin 1 expression in both 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups compared with those after the 12 h intervention (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the 10% FBS and 10% EA serum groups in the expression levels of Myod and Beclin 1 proteins (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: EA serum can promote proliferation of cultured muscle satellite cells under starvation conditions, which is related to its functions in regulating expression of Beclin 1 and cell-proliferation-related protein Myod. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Animals#Antigens, Differentiation#Beclin-1#Electroacupuncture#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Objective: To explore the limb salvage strategies for patients with high voltage electric burns of extremities on the verge of amputation. Methods: From January 2003 to March 2019, 61 patients with high voltage electric burns of extremities on the verge of amputation were treated in our hospital. All of them were male, aged 15-58 years, including 49 cases of upper limbs and 12 cases of lower limbs. The wound area after thorough debridement ranged from 15 cm?11 cm to 35 cm?20 cm. Emergency surgery for reconstruction of the radial artery with saphenous vein graft under eschar was performed in 5 cases. The arteries of 36 patients (including 7 cases with simultaneous ulnar artery and radial artery reconstruction) were reconstructed with various forms of blood flow-through after debridement, among them, the radial artery of 13 cases, the ulnar artery of 8 cases, the brachial artery of 8 cases, and the femoral artery of 2 cases were reconstructed with saphenous vein graft; the radial artery of 3 cases and the ulnar artery of 7 cases were reconstructed with the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery graft; the radial artery of 2 cases were reconstructed with greater omentum vascular graft; the reflux vein of 3 cases with wrist and forearm annular electric burns were reconstructed with saphenous vein graft. According to the actual situation of the patients, 12 cases of latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, 6 cases of paraumbilical flap, 28 cases of anterolateral thigh flap, 10 cases of abdominal combined axial flap, 5 cases of greater omentum combined with flap and/or skin grafts were used to repair the wounds after debridement and cover the main wounds as much as possible. Some cases were filled with muscle flap in deep defect at the same time. The area of tissue flaps ranged from 10 cm?10 cm to 38 cm?22 cm. For particularly large wounds and annular wounds, the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, the paraumbilical flap, the abdominal combined axial flap, and the greater omentum combined with flap and/or skin grafts were used more often. Donor sites of three patients were closed directly, and those of 58 patients were repaired with thin and medium split-thickness skin or mesh skin grafts. The outcome of limb salvage, flap survival, and follow-up of patients in this group were recorded. Results: All the transplanted tissue flaps survived in 61 patients. Fifty-six patients had successful limb salvage, among them, 31 limbs were healed after primary surgery; 20 limbs with flap infection and tissue necrosis survived after debridement and flap sutured in situ; 5 limbs with flap infection, radial artery thrombosis, and hand blood supply crisis survived after debridement and radial artery reconstruction with saphenous vein graft. Five patients had limb salvage failure, among them, 3 patients with wrist electric burns had embolism on the distal end of the transplanted blood vessels, without condition of re-anastomosis, and the hands gradually necrotized; although the upper limb of one patient was salvaged at first, due to the extensive necrosis and infection at the distal radius and ulna and the existence of hand blood supply under flap, considering prognostic function and economic benefits, amputation was required by the patient; although the foot of one patient was salvaged at first, due to the repeated infection, sinus formation, extensive bone necrosis of foot under flap, dullness of sole and dysfunction in walking for a long time, amputation was required by the patient. During the follow-up of 6 months to 5 years, 56 patients had adequate blood supply in the salvaged limbs, satisfied appearance of flaps, and certain recovery of limb function. Conclusions: Timely revascularization, early thorough debridement, and transplantation of large free tissue flap, combined tissue flap, or blood flow-through flap with rich blood supply are the basic factors to get better limb preservation and recovery of certain functions for patients with high voltage electric burns of limbs on the verge of amputation. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Amputation#Burns, Electric#Humans#Limb Salvage#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Treatment Outcome#Wound Healing#Young Adult'
b'\\n             Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the top 10 infectious diseases with highest mortality globally since the 1990s despite effective chemotherapy. Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography - nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania - has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30-50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis. More efforts need to be placed if we are to reduce the death toll by 90 % until 2030.\\n           labels: #Adult#Child#Diagnostic Tests, Routine#Humans#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tanzania#Tuberculosis'
b'A novel imaging-driven technique with an integrated fluorescence signature to enable automated enumeration of two species of cyanobacteria and an alga of somewhat similar morphology to one of the cyanobacteria is presented to demonstrate proof-of-concept that high accuracy, imaging-based, rapid water quality analysis can be with conventional equipment available in typical water quality laboratories-this is not currently available. The results presented herein demonstrate that the developed method identifies and enumerates cyanobacterial cells at a level equivalent to or better than that achieved using standard manual microscopic enumeration techniques, but in less time, and requiring significantly fewer resources. When compared with indirect measurement methods, the proposed method provides better accuracy at both low and high cell concentrations. It extends the detection range for cell enumeration while maintaining accuracy and increasing enumeration speed. The developed method not only accurately estimates cell concentrations, but it also reliably distinguishes between cells of Anabaena flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Ankistrodesmus in mixed cultures by taking advantage of additional contrast between the target cell and complex background gained under fluorescent light. Thus, the proposed image-driven approach offers promise as a robust and cost-effective tool for identifying and enumerating microscopic cells based on their unique morphological features. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of PR-957 on the formation of A1 reactive astrocytes.METHODS: The cerebral cortices of 1-day-old female rats were obtained and cultured for primary astrocytes. These cells were divided into 3 groups: control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LPS+PR-957. The LPS group was treated with LPS (at a concentration of 5 \\xc3\\xacmol/L) for 48 hours; the LPS+PR-957 group was treated with PR-957 (at a final concentration of 200 nmol/L) for 1 hour and then LPS for 48 hours. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the expression of complement 3 (C3, a marker for A1 reactive astrocytes) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\xc3\\xa1). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the relative mRNA expression of glypican-6 (GPC6), SPARC-like 1 (SPARCL1), and lipocalin-2 (LCN2). All the above experiments were repeated three times independently.RESULTS: C3 expression was almost not observed in the control group, but was observed in both the LPS group and the LPS+PR-957 group, with significantly lower expression observed in the LPS+PR-957 group (P<0.05). The expression of TNF-\\xc3\\xa1 was consistent with that of C3. Compared with the control group, the LPS and the PS+PR-957 groups had significantly reduced mRNA expression levels of GPC6 and SPARCL1 but significantly increased mRNA expression level of LCN2 (P<0.001). Compared with the LPS group, the LPS+PR-957 group had significantly increased mRNA expression levels of GPC6 and SPARCL1 but significantly reduced mRNA expression level of LCN2 (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: LPS can induce the transformation from astrocytes to A1 reactive astrocytes, and PR-957 can inhibit the formation of LPS-induced A1 reactive astrocytes. labels: #Animals#Astrocytes#Female#Lipopolysaccharides#Oligopeptides#Rats#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha'
b'The allelopathic effects of Myriophyllum elatinoides on algal growth were investigated and potential allelochemicals secreted by Myriophyllum elatinoides were analyzed. Myriophyllum elatinoides were co-cultivated with different initial concentrations (105, 106, 107, 108, and 109 ind.\\xc2\\xb7L-1) of Microcystis aeruginosa and Selenastrum capricornutum. The optical density of each group was measured daily. The results showed that 2.5 g\\xc2\\xb7(200 mL)-1 of Myriophyllum elatinoides has significant inhibition effect on Microcystis aeruginosa growth with initial concentrations of 107 ind.\\xc2\\xb7L-1 and 108 ind.\\xc2\\xb7L-1. However, there was no significant inhibition on the growth of Selenastrum capricornutum. Through solvent extraction and GC-MS analysis, hexadecanoic acid was extracted and determined as an allelochemical in Myriophyllum elatinoides. Additionally, three potentially novel allelochemical compounds secreted by Myriophyllum elatinoides were determined as follows:3-ethyl-3-methylheptane, triethyl phosphate and dibutyl phthalate. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the change in P wave on electrocardiogram and its diagnostic value in children and adolescents with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope (VVS-CI).METHODS: A total of 43 children and adolescents who were diagnosed with VVS-CI were enrolled as the VVS-CI group, and 43 healthy children and adolescents were enrolled as the control group. P wave duration and P wave voltage were measured by 12-lead electrocardiography in a basal state, and the changes were analyzed.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the VVS-CI group had a significantly lower heart rate (P<0.05) and significantly longer P wave duration (Pwd), P wave maximum duration (Pmax), and corrected P wave maximum duration (Pcmax), as well as significantly higher P wave dispersion (Pd) and corrected P wave dispersion (Pcd) (P<0.05). Pwd, Pmax, Pd, Pcmax and Pcd had a certain diagnostic value in children and adolescents with VVS-CI (P<0.05): Pwd had a sensitivity of 69.77% and a specificity of 83.72% at the optimal cut-off value of 78.49 ms; Pmax had a sensitivity of 76.74% and a specificity of 90.70% at the optimal cut-off value of 93.39 ms; Pd had a sensitivity of 95.35% and a specificity of 69.77% at the optimal cut-off value of 27.42 ms; Pcmax had a sensitivity of 46.51% and a specificity of 88.37% at the optimal cut-off value of 120.90 ms; Pcd had a sensitivity of 83.72% and a specificity of 72.09% at the optimal cut-off value of 36.37 ms.CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with VVS-CI have significantly increased Pwd, Pmax, Pd, Pcmax, and Pcd, which may indicate abnormal atrial electrical activity. The cut-off value of P wave has a certain diagnostic value in VVS-CI. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Electrocardiography#Heart Rate#Humans#Syncope, Vasovagal'
b'Isoprenoid diphosphates are important precursors actively participating in many downstream metabolisms; they are often in modified forms, e.g., protein-coupled or esterified form. Therefore, in vivo level of free isoprenoid diphosphates is quite low, ?0.07\\xe2\\x80\\x89nmol/g fresh weight in plants. In order to directly measure the isoprenoid diphosphate pool during stress-induced accumulation of astaxanthin in Haematococcus pluvialis, the present study optimized several pretreatment procedures to enrich free isoprenoid diphosphates for high-pressure liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) detection. Specifically, different extraction solvents, e.g., water, methanol, chloroform, and mixture of water, methanol, and chloroform (1:1:1, V/V/V), and solid phase extraction (SPE) columns (OASIS@ WAX and HLB Cartridges) were compared; and gentle decoupling by NaOH or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was introduced to release free isoprenoid diphosphates. Results found that solvent mixture of water, methanol and chloroform (1:1:1, V/V/V) showed the highest extraction efficiency (RE) for five isoprenoid diphosphates, ranging from 76.83% to 92.43%; HLB column showed the balanced recoveries ranging from 75.29% to 87.54%; and incubation with low NaOH (?4.7\\xe2\\x80\\x89mmol/L) at 4\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb0C significantly increased detectable isoprenoid diphosphates in algal cells, some of which were undetectable or in trace level before NaOH decoupling. The method was applied to H. pluvialis cells under various stresses. Low levels of isoprenoid diphosphates were determined in most of the stresses used, e.g., 0.19\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.09 to 0.98\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.06\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg/g fresh weight (FW) for IPP/DMAPP, 0.35\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.07\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg/g FW for GGPP and undetectable for FPP and GPP; while isoprenoid diphosphates were significantly accumulated in the dark to 3.27\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.05, 0.17\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.09, 1.81\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.16 and 0.58\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x890.07\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg/g FW for IPP/DMAPP, GPP, FPP and GGPP, respectively. These results implied that isoprenoid diphosphates were exhausted by downstream carotenogenesis under stress.

b'Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and diagnostic strategies of early hydatidiform mole. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 526 women with hydatidiform mole who underwent suction curettage and were confirmed by histopathology in Dalian Maternal and ChildHealth Care Hospital from Feb. 2013 to Feb. 2018, including 484 women with gestational age less than or equal to 12 weeks (the early group) and 42 women with gestational age greater than 12 weeks (the late group). The clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and the pathological diagnosis and pre-evacuation ultrasound examination of the early group were further discussed. Results: Compared with the late group, the clinical characteristics of the early group tended to be atypical, and the incidence of vaginal bleeding, excessive uterine size, theca lutein cysts (>6 cm) and pregnancy complications decreased significantly (all P<0.05). The serum level of \\xc3\\xa2-hCG in the early group was significantly lower than that in the late group (Z=-2.382, P=0.017). While there was no significant difference in the pre-evacuation ultrasound detection rate between the two groups (53.5% vs 66.7%; \\xc3\\xb7(2)=2.697, P=0.101). Five hundred and fifteen patients completed the follow-up, and 38 patients with post-mole neoplasia were all cured. There was no significant difference in the malignant transformation rate of hydatidiform mole between the two groups (7.0% vs 11.9%; \\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.745, P=0.388). In the early group, 302 cases of complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), 179 cases of partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) and 3 cases of unclassified hydatidiform mole (UHM) were histologically diagnosed, according to pathological morphology combined with p57(KIP2) immunohistochemical staining. Compared with pathological diagnosis, the overall pre-evacuation ultrasound detection rate in the early hydatidiform mole was 53.5% (259/484), which was significantly better for complete (78.1%, 236/302) versus partial (11.7%, 21/179) hydatidiform moles (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=199.224, P<0.01). There was significantly weak negative correlation between the overall ultrasound detection rate and gestational age of hydatidiform mole (r=-0.211, P<0.01). The gestational age of early PHM was significantly longer than that of CHM (68.0 vs 58.5 days; Z=-8.048, P<0.01). Conclusions: The clinical presentations of early hydatidiform mole are not typical. Although ultrasound examination identifies only about half of hydatidiform moles, ultrasonography is still an important auxiliary examination method. Morphological examination combined with p57(K)IP2 immunohistochemical staining could effectively diagnose early hydatidiform mole, so as to reduce the missed diagnosis of hydatidiform mole. labels: #China#Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human#Female#Gestational Age#Humans#Hydatidiform Mole#Incidence#Pregnancy#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome#Ultrasonography#Uterine Hemorrhage#Uterine Neoplasms#Vacuum Curettage'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effect of the SCMC APL-2010 regimen in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in children.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 44 children with APL who received treatment with the SCMC APL-2010 regimen between April 2010 and July 2016. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate.RESULTS: Of the 44 children with APL, 42 (95%) achieved a complete remission (CR) after one course of treatment and 1 achieved CR after two courses of treatment, with an overall CR rate of 98%. The 9-year EFS and OS rates were 96%\\xc2\\xb13% and 97.7%\\xc2\\xb12.2% respectively. As for adverse events, 41 (93%) had infection, 29 (66%) had granulocyte reduction, 12 (27%, 1 died) had differentiation syndrome, 16 (36%) had liver dysfunction, 12 (27%) had adverse gastrointestinal reactions, and 7 (16%) had QT prolongation, 1 (2%) had orchitis, and no secondary neoplasm was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Children with APL receiving the SCMC APL-2010 regimen have a good prognosis and can achieve a long-term survival, while treatment-related infection is commonly seen. labels: #Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Child#Disease-Free Survival#Humans#Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute#Male#Remission Induction#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Tretinoin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To assess biventricular, especially right ventricular, function and deformationin rhesus monkeys with spontaneous type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).METHODS: Twelve male spontaneous T2DM rhesus monkeys and age, sex, body mass matched 9 healthy rhesus monkeys without hypertension and myocardial infarction were included in this study. Fasting blood glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood liquid levels were measured. Biventricular function and myocardial deformations were evaluated by CMR cine and tissue-tracking.RESULTS: Compared with control, the FPG and HbA1c levers were significantly increased in T2DM group, but there was no significant difference in body mass and age between the two groups. CMR result showed that there was no significant decrease in right ventricle and left ventricle ejection fraction in T2DM (P < 0.05). However, the absolute value of radial and circumferential global peak systolic strain, systolic strain rate and three directions global peak diastolic strain rate of the right ventricle free wall were lower in the T2DM group (P < 0.05). Also, only radial and circumferential peak systolic strain and radial diastolic strain rate of left ventricle were higher (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricle showed systolic and diastolic dysfunction which were consistent with left ventricle in T2DM by CMR-tissue tracking. labels: #Animals#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2#Heart Ventricles#Macaca mulatta#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Reproducibility of Results#Stroke Volume#Ventricular Dysfunction, Right'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of "Yinqi Guiyuan" needling in the treatment of primary insomnia.METHODS: A total of 79 primary insomnia outpatients were randomly divided into treatment group (n=40) and control group (n=39). The patients in the control group were given oral Estazolam tablets once a day, for successive 4 weeks. For patients of the treatment group, Zhongwan (CV12), Xiawan (CV10), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), Baihui (GV20), etc., were punctured with filiform needles for 30 min. The treatment was conducted three times per week for 4 successive weeks. The sleep quality (sleeping quality, falling asleep time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, hypnotic and daytime dysfunction, 0 to 21 points) was evaluated by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The severity of insomnia (self-perception, sleep satisfaction, daytime function damage, sensibility change, and concern for sleep problems, 0 to 28 points) was assessed using insomnia severity index (ISI) score. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the PSQI score reduction rate = (pre-treatment PSQI score-post-treatment PSQI score)/pre-treatment PSQI score ?100%.RESULTS: After treatment, the total score of PSQI, ISI and the score of each item were all significantly reduced in the two groups relevant to their own pre-treatment (P<0.05). The total score, and scores of hypnotic and daytime dysfunction were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05). Of the 40 and 39 cases in the treatment and control groups, 5 (12.50%) and 4 (10.25%) were cured, 20 (50.00%) and 18 (46.15%) experienced marked improvement, 12 (30.00%) and 13 (33.33%) were effective, and 3 (7.50%) and 4 (10.25%) ineffective, with the total effective rate being 92.50% and 89.74%, respectively. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the effective rate (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: "Yinqi Guiyuan" needling and Estazolam are comparable in treatment primary insomnia, and the former is superior to the latter in avoiding hypnotic drug use and in improving daytime function. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Acupuncture Therapy#Humans#Sleep#Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders#Treatment Outcome'
b'Recent molecular data has strongly suggested that field-collected cysts of snow algae that are morphologically identifiable as the zygotes of Chloromonas nivalis are composed of multiple species. Motile vegetative cells, however, have not been directly obtained from these cysts because of the difficulties involved in inducing their germination. Recently, our comparative molecular analyses, using both field-collected and cultured materials, demonstrated that one Japanese lineage of "C. nivalis zygotes" belongs to C. miwae. Herein, we examined another Japanese lineage of field-collected "C. nivalis zygotes" and a new strain originating from Japan. Our molecular data demonstrated that these two different life cycle stages are conspecific, and that they represent a new species that we herein describe as C. muramotoi sp. nov., based on the vegetative and asexual morphological characteristics of the strain. Multigene phylogenetic analyses showed that this new species was sister to C. miwae. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the cysts of C. muramotoi are different from those of C. miwae, based on the arrangement of the flanges developing on the cell wall. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is the family of Ser/Thr protein kinases that has emerged as a highly selective with low toxic cancer therapy target. A multistage virtual screening method combined by SVM, protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (PLIF) pharmacophore and docking was utilised for screening the CDK2 inhibitors. The evaluation of the validation set indicated that this method can be used to screen large chemical databases because it has a high hit-rate and enrichment factor (80.1% and 332.83 respectively). Six compounds were screened out from NCI, Enamine and Pubchem database. After molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculation, two compounds had great potential as novel CDK2 inhibitors and they also showed selective inhibition against CDK2 in the kinase activity assay. labels: #A549 Cells#Antineoplastic Agents#Cell Proliferation#Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2#Dose-Response Relationship, Drug#Drug Evaluation, Preclinical#Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor#HCT116 Cells#Humans#Molecular Docking Simulation#Molecular Structure#Protein Kinase Inhibitors#Structure-Activity Relationship#Support Vector Machine'
b'The need to protect communities from hazardous waste is an important agenda for any nation. Although pollutant management and policy development are attempted in many developing countries, it is not always successful due to limited funds, project resources, and access to trained experts to conduct toxic site identification projects. For this reason, Pure Earth created the Toxic Site Identification Program (TSIP). The goal of the TSIP program is to provide reliable information and data that identifies location of toxic sites and the level of toxic severity. TSIP is significant because it provides developing countries a database of ranked toxic sites identified as hazardous risk to human health. For example, Azerbaijan is one of the most polluted post-Soviet nations, but has limited resources to address and manage its polluted sites. The Azerbaijani TSIP database is the first reliable data source that identifies hazardous pollutants in the country. Our study is significant because it discusses how the TSIP labels and ranks the level of toxic severity to human health. It is also the first data source in Azerbaijan that identifies which Soviet legacy toxic sites are affecting local communities. Although our study is specific to Azerbaijan, the TSIP method can be applied to nations with similar data limitations and the need for a database that identifies country specific environmental and hazardous locations. The data sampling method and results are mapped and accompanied by tables of the collected pollutant types to identify communities at greatest health-risk to legacy toxic sites. labels: #Azerbaijan#Developing Countries#Environmental Pollutants#Hazardous Waste#Humans'

b'Bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushing and transbronchial biopsy are of fundamental importance in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting the lungs of immunosuppressed patients, especially those infected with HIV. This was a descriptive and retrospective study, in which the results of bronchoalveolar lavages, bronchial brushings and transbronchial biopsies of HIV-positive patients attended at the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro from 1999 to 2015 were reviewed to determine the most frequent findings in these patients, to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures and to correlate bronchoscopy results with clinical and radiological findings. Serological tests for HIV were confirmed and cases with negative or unverified serology were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for correlation with clinical and radiological findings. A total of 1,423 patients with a mean age of 50 years were initially selected; 727 cases had no serology for HIV; 696 had serology for HIV and 64 were positive. Of these, 47 were men, aged 24 to 84 years, and 17 women, aged 31 to 69 years. Biopsies and cytological tests were positive in 20 (31.25%) of the 64 patients and the most frequent diagnosis was pneumocystosis, found in 8 cases (12.5%). Of the 20 bronchofibroscopy-positive patients, only 2 did not show agreement between histopathological and clinical-radiological diagnoses. The analysis of the cytological tests and biopsy specimens obtained by bronchofibroscopy seems to be valuable for the etiological diagnosis of pulmonary infections in HIV- positive patients; however, negative results do not always exclude the diagnosis. In these cases, clinical symptoms and imaging findings may help to guide the best therapy. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Biopsy#Bronchoalveolar Lavage#Bronchoscopy#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Lung Diseases#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Young Adult'
b'Cell size correlates with most traits among phytoplankton species. Theory predicts that larger cells should show poorer photosynthetic performance, perhaps due to reduced intracellular self-shading (i.e. package effect). Yet current theory relies heavily on interspecific correlational approaches and causal relationships between size and photosynthetic machinery have remained untested. As a more direct test, we applied 250 generations of artificial selection (c. 20\\xc2\\xa0months) to evolve the green microalga Dunaliella teriolecta (Chlorophyta) toward different mean cell sizes, while monitoring all major photosynthetic parameters. Evolving larger sizes (>\\xc2\\xa01500% difference in volume) resulted in reduced oxygen production per chlorophyll molecule - as predicted by the package effect. However, large-evolved cells showed substantially higher rates of oxygen production - a finding unanticipated by current theory. In addition, volume-specific photosynthetic pigments increased with size (Chla+b), while photo-protectant pigments decreased (\\xc3\\xa2-carotene). Finally, larger cells displayed higher growth performances and Fv /Fm , steeper slopes of rapid light curves (\\xc3\\xa1) and smaller light-harvesting antennae (\\xc3\\xb3PSII ) with higher connectivity (\\xc3\\xb1). Overall, evolving a common ancestor into different sizes showed that the photosynthetic characteristics of a species coevolves with cell volume. Moreover, our experiment revealed a trade-off between chlorophyll-specific (decreasing with size) and volume-specific (increasing with size) oxygen production in a cell. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'PURPOSE: Short implants are a minimally invasive alternative in the management of alveolar bone atrophy. This study aimed to assess the influence of the surgical approach (1-stage vs 2-stage) on the 15-year survival and marginal bone loss of short implants in a fixed complete denture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was conducted in a single private dental clinic that included short implants placed between January 2001 and December 2002.RESULTS: Forty-one short implants supported 18 screw-retained complete dentures.

b'Dyspnea and exercise intolerance are usually attributed to pulmonary disease in sarcoidosis patients. However, cardiac involvement may also be responsible for these symptoms. Data regarding the impact of heart involvement on lung function in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is limited.The aim of study was to compare the results of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with and without heart involvement. We performed a retrospective analysis of PFTs in a group of sarcoidosis patients both with and without heart involvement evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study. The study was performed in the period between May 2008 and April 2016.We included data of sarcoidosis patients who underwent testing for possible CS (including CMR study) at a national tertiary referral center for patients with interstitial lung diseases. All patients had histopathologicaly confirmed sarcoidosis and underwent standard evaluation with PFTs measurements including spirometry, plethysmography, lung transfer factor (TL,CO), and 6-minute walking test (6MWT) assessed using the most recent predicted values.We identified 255 sarcoidosis patients (93 women, age 42\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a10.7 y): 103 with CS and 152 without CS (controls). CS patients had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 56.9\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a7.0 vs 60.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a5.4, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001).

b'PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Phylogenomic analyses across the green algae are resolving relationships at the class, order, and family levels and highlighting dynamic patterns of evolution in organellar genomes. Here we present a within-family phylogenomic study to resolve genera and species relationships in the family Hydrodictyaceae (Chlorophyceae), for which poor resolution in previous phylogenetic studies, along with divergent morphological traits, have precluded taxonomic revisions.METHODS: Complete plastome sequences and mitochondrial protein-coding gene sequences were acquired from representatives of the Hydrodictyaceae using next-generation sequencing methods. Plastomes were characterized, and gene order and content were compared with plastomes spanning the Sphaeropleales. Single-gene and concatenated-gene phylogenetic analyses of plastid and mitochondrial genes were performed.KEY RESULTS: The Hydrodictyaceae contain the largest sphaeroplealean plastomes thus far fully sequenced. Conservation of plastome gene order within Hydrodictyaceae is striking compared with more dynamic patterns revealed across Sphaeropleales. Phylogenetic analyses resolve Hydrodictyon sister to a monophyletic Pediastrum, though the morphologically distinct P. angulosum and P. duplex continue to be polyphyletic. Analyses of plastid data supported the neochloridacean genus Chlorotetra?dron as sister to Hydrodictyaceae, while conflicting signal was found in the mitochondrial data.CONCLUSIONS: A phylogenomic approach resolved within-family relationships not obtainable with previous phylogenetic analyses. Denser taxon sampling across Sphaeropleales is necessary to capture patterns in plastome evolution, and further taxa and studies are needed to fully resolve the sister lineage to Hydrodictyaceae and polyphyly of Pediastrum angulosum and P. duplex. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, which seriously affects human health. Gramicidin is a short peptide antibiotic which could be used for treating infection induced by bacteria or fungi. However, the anti-cancer effect of gramicidin on gastric cancer cells and its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.RESULTS: Gastric cancer cells SGC-7901, BGC-823 and normal gastric mucosal cells GES-1 were treated with different concentrations of gramicidin respectively. The results of CCK-8 experiment revealed cellular toxicity of gramicidin to cancer cells while cell colony formation assay showed that gramicidin significantly inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, but had little effect on normal gastric mucosal cells. In addition, the wound healing assay showed that gramicidin inhibited the migration of SGC-7901 cell. Meanwhile, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis revealed that gramicidin induced cell apoptosis with G2/M cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that gramicidin down-regulated the expression of cyclinD1 and Bcl-2 as well as the FoxO1 phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: The current study illustrated the anti-tumor activity of gramicidin on gastric cancer cells, providing a possibility for gramicidin to be applied in clinical practice for the treatment of gastric cancer. labels: #Apoptosis#Cell Cycle#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Cyclin D1#Down-Regulation#Forkhead Box Protein O1#Gramicidin#Humans#Phosphorylation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2#Stomach Neoplasms'
b'OBJECTIVE: To analyze of the minimum graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) required for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) without middle hepatic vein branch (MHVT) reconstruction.METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical data and outcomes of 303 LDLT patients over 16 years from 2001 to 2017. The minimum GRWR of non-middle hepatic vein reconstruction was analyzed by propensity score (PSM).RESULTS: With PSM analysis, no significant differences were observed in postoperative complications, SFSS, inpatient time, liver function, and coagulation function, but significant differences in 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival between MHVT reconstruction and non-reconstruction group. The patients with MHVT reconstruction had better short-term and long-term survival than those without reconstruction.CONCLUSION: For LDLT patients without HMVT reconstruction, GRWR should be greater than 0.86%; for patients with HMVT reconstruction, GRWR is acceptable between 0.5% and 0.6%. labels: #Graft Survival#Hepatic Veins#Humans#Liver#Liver Transplantation#Living Donors#Organ Size#Propensity Score#Retrospective Studies#Survival Rate'
b'Depressive disorder is one of the most widespread forms of mental disorders which lead to a significant public health concern, such as disability, suicide, and so on. Its etiology remains vague but it is believed that depressive disorder is a multifactorial disease which is induced by the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Thus, there is no clear and definite pathological theory could illustrate its mechanism independently until now, involving genetics, neuroimaging, neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine, and others. Comprehensive assessment to patients with depression is the starting point for a right diagnosis. History-taking of physical condition is as important as psychiatric interview and rational usage of scales would be beneficial for screening. There are many kinds of therapeutic measures for depressive patients nowadays, including general intervention, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and physical therapy. For now, anti-depressants used in clinical practice is almost monoamine-based drugs while much more progress have been made in developing new antidepressant medications, like prototypical N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, opioid agonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, and psychedelics. Once these novel drugs are proved to be practicable, it will create a historical evolution in the field of psychiatry. In addition, we advocate that measurement-based care (MBC) should run through the whole duration of treatment and goals of MBC in every stage are different. As brain projects in many countries are conducting in inspiring ways, we believe that our understanding about depressive disorder, of course, and other neuropsychiatric disorders will be better in the future. labels: #Antidepressive Agents#Depression#Depressive Disorder, Major#Humans#Psychotherapy'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the application value of surface electromyography in children with dysphagia.METHODS: A total of 20 children with dysphagia were enrolled as the observation group, and 20 healthy children, matched for sex and age, were enrolled as the control group. Surface electromyography was used to record the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the resting state and the state after water swallowing. The two groups were compared in terms of the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the resting state and the state after swallowing 5\\xe2\\x80\\x85mL water. The observation group was observed in terms of the changes in the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups after 1 month of rehabilitation treatment. A Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation of the degree of dysphagia with the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the observation group.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups in the resting state (P>0.05), while after water swallowing, the observation group had significantly higher electromyography integral values than the control group (P<0.05). The observation group had significant improvements in the clinical symptoms of dysphagia after treatment, with significant reductions in the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups (P<0.05). The severity of dysphagia was positively correlated with the electromyography integral values of the submental and infrahyoid muscle groups (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Surface electromyography is useful in the diagnosis and therapeutic effect evaluation for dysphagia in children. labels: #Child#Deglutition#Deglutition Disorders#Electromyography#Humans'
b'Carotenoids are lipophilic pigments found in plants and algae, as well as some bacteria, archaea, and fungi that serve two functions-(1) as light harvesting molecules-primary carotenoids, and (2) as antioxidants, acting against reactive oxygen species\\xe2\\x81\\xbbsecondary carotenoids. Because of their strong antioxidant properties, they are also valuable for the development of anti-aging and photo-protective cosmetic applications. Of particular interest is the carotenoid phytoene, for its colorless and UV absorption characteristics. In this study, we targeted a reduction of phytoene desaturase (PDS) activity with the pigment-inhibiting herbicide 1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridin-4-one (fluridone), which leads to the over-accumulation of phytoene in the recently characterized microalgal strain Chlorococcum sp. (UTEX B 3056). After post-incubation with fluridone, phytoene levels were measured at ~33 ug/mg cell tissue, as opposed to non-detectable levels in control cultures. Hence, the novel microalga Chlorococcum sp. is a viable candidate for the production of the high-value carotenoid phytoene and subsequent applications in cosmeceuticals, as well as more obvious nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The traditional green algal genus Chloromonas accommodates mesophilic, cold-tolerant and cold-adapted microorganisms. In this paper, we studied a new strain isolated from a wet hummock meadow in the High Arctic. We used morphological, ultrastructural and molecular data to assess the taxonomic position and phylogenetic relationships of the new isolate. The observed morphological features generally corresponded to the cold-tolerant Chloromonas characteristics. However, ellipsoidal or wide ellipsoidal vegetative cells, a massive parietal cup-shaped chloroplast with a number of continuously connected lobes, a thick cell wall, a prominent hemispherical papilla and the anterior position of an oblong or round eyespot distinguished the alga from all previously described Chloromonas species. Analyses of rbcL and 18S rRNA genes showed that the new strain formed an independent lineage within a clade containing mesophilic and psychrotolerant Chloromonas species. Comparisons of secondary structure models of a highly variable ITS2 rDNA marker supported a separate species identity of the new isolate. Considering the morphological and molecular differences from its relatives, a new psychrotolerant species, Chloromonas svalbardensis, is proposed. Further, our results demonstrated the paraphyletic origin of Chloromonas within Chloromonadinia with genetically, morphologically and ecologically well-defined clades. We discuss a scenario of a possible Chloromonas split and revision. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Both the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity data on aquatic organisms are indispensable parameters in the ecological risk assessment priority chemical screening process (e.g. persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals). However, most of the present modelling actions are focused on developing predictive models for the acute toxicity of chemicals to aquatic organisms. As regards chronic aquatic toxicity, considerable work is needed. The major objective of the present study was to construct in silico models for predicting chronic toxicity data for Daphnia magna and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. In the modelling, a set of chronic toxicity data was collected for D. magna (21 days no observed effect concentration (NOEC)) and P. subcapitata (72 h NOEC), respectively. Then, binary classification models were developed for D. magna and P. subcapitata by employing the k-nearest neighbour method (k-NN). The model assessment results indicated that the obtained optimum models had high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The model application domain was characterized by the Euclidean distance-based method. In the future, the data gap for other chemicals within the application domain on their chronic toxicity for D. magna and P. subcapitata could be filled using the models developed here. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"PURPOSE: This prospective study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of 'All-on-four' rehabilitations in controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Edentulous patients requiring an implant prosthetic restoration of one or both jaws were enrolled in the present study. Each patient received at least one fixed full-arch prosthesis. Four implants, immediately loaded, were placed in each jaw using the 'All-on-four' protocol. Marginal bone loss, implant and prosthetic failure, biological and mechanical complications, and serological levels (CD4 cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and HIV viral load) were recorded up to 7-year follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 116 implants were placed in 24 patients, and 29 rehabilitations based on the 'All-on-four' concept were achieved. Implant failures were registered in four patients (10 of 116 implants), and the implant survival rate was 91.37%. At the 7-year radiographic evaluation, peri-implant crestal bone loss averaged 1.91 \\xc2\\xb1 1.3 mm for upright maxillary implants (n = 30 implants) and 1.79 \\xc2\\xb1 1.28 mm for tilted maxillary implants (n = 30 implants). In the mandible, mean peri-implant crestal bone loss was 1.54 \\xc2\\xb1 1.27 mm for upright implants (n = 28) and 1.5 \\xc2\\xb1 1.3 mm for tilted implants (n = 28). No statistically significant correlation was found between serological parameters and marginal bone levels at 6 months, or through 7 years of annual follow-up (P > 0.05). A statistically significant linear correlation (P < 0.001) was found between early implant failure and HIV viral load. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly correlated with late implant failure (P = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this prospective 7-year longitudinal study, HIV-positive patients with a stable immune system can be candidates for the 'All-on-four' treatment concept. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Implants#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Prospective Studies"
b"Objective: To explore the effect of tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall in emergency treatment of laryngeal edema in patients with burns. Methods: From November 2000 to August 2018, 22 patients with severe burn or extremely severe burn combined with acute laryngeal edema were rescued in the author's unit, including 18 males and 4 females, aged 17 to 68 years. All patients were complicated with mild inhalation injury or above and more than deep partial-thickness burn to head, face, and neck. From November 2000 to October 2012, simple emergency tracheotomy was performed for 12 cases. From May 2013 to August 2018, tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall was performed for 10 cases. Rescue effect and complication of the two kinds of tracheotomy were recorded. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test. Results: Among the 12 patients treated with simple emergency tracheotomy, 5 cases survived and 7 cases died of suffocation during tracheotomy. Among the 10 patients treated with tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall, 9 cases survived and 1 case died of cardiac arrest caused by arrhythmia. There was statistically significant difference in successful rescue effect between the two kinds of tracheotomy (P<0.05). Among the 14 patients who were successfully rescued, symptoms of insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder occurred in 12 cases, which were relieved after symptomatic treatment for 14 to 45 d without permanent hypoxic brain damage. Conclusions: In case of loss of the condition of preventive tracheotomy, first aid of acute laryngeal edema of burn patient is very difficult. Tracheotomy combined with thyrocricocentesis and puncture of front tracheal wall is simple and rapid with high successful rate and amelioration of hypoxia, which is an ideal plan for laryngeal edema. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Airway Obstruction#Burns#Emergency Treatment#Female#Humans#Laryngeal Edema#Male#Middle Aged#Punctures#Tracheotomy#Young Adult"
b"Objective: To explore the clinical efficacy of lobulated transplantation of free anterolateral thigh perforator flap in repairing electric burn wounds of limbs. Methods: From August 2014 to April 2019, 19 patients with electric burns in the limbs were hospitalized in our unit, including 18 males and 1 female, aged 20-58 years. There were 37 wounds deep to bone. The area of wounds ranged from 3.0 cm?2.0 cm to 40.0 cm?8.0 cm. Multiple-perforator-based anterolateral thigh flap was designed and resected. Then the flap was lobulated taking the respective perforators of the lateral circumflex femoral artery as the axial vessels before being transplanted to the debrided wounds in the limbs. The blood vessel trunk or the perforator vessels of flap lobes were anastomosed with the respective vessels in the recipient sites. The wounds were repaired with respective lobes of the flap when repairing multiple wounds in one surgical procedure, whereas the lobes were spliced or staggered to cover the wound to fit the shape of wound when repairing a single irregular wound in one surgical procedure. For the limb with distal blood supply disorder, the blood supply branch of flap was used to reconstruct the blood supply. If necessary, an appropriate length of vein was taken for transplantation. The improvement of reconstructed blood supply was observed. The number of surgeries, the number of anterolateral thigh perforator flaps, the number and size of flap lobes, the number of anastomosed vessels in each surgery, the treatment of the donor sites, the length of each surgery, the postoperative complications and survival condition of flap lobes were recorded. The upper extremity function was evaluated with the Carroll's Upper Extremity Function Test Scale, and the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery was investigated with a 5-point Likert Scale during follow-up. Surgeries were divided into single wound group of repairing one wound at one time and multiple wounds group of repairing two or more wounds at one time. The number of anastomosed vessels in each surgery, the treatment of the donor sites, the length of each surgery, and the postoperative survival condition of the flap lobes were compared between the two groups. Surgeries were divided into early group of performing surgery within post burn day 7 and late group of performing surgery on post burn day 7 and beyond. The postoperative complications and survival condition of flap lobes, the evaluation score of upper limb function and the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery at the last follow-up were compared between the two groups. Data were processed with independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: The blood supply of 5 patients with distal hand or finger blood supply disorder recovered or improved significantly after vascular transplantation. A total of 46 lobes [(2.2\\xc2\\xb10.4) lobes per flap] were obtained from 21 anterolateral thigh perforator flaps in 19 patients with 21 surgeries. The area of flap lobes ranged from 4.0 cm?3.0 cm to 24.0 cm?13.0 cm. In each surgery, 2.0 (1.5, 3.0) arteries and 3.0 (2.0, 3.0) veins were anastomosed. Six donor sites were repaired by thin split-thickness scalp, and 15 donor sites were closed directly. The duration of each surgery was (8.9\\xc2\\xb11.7) h. After surgery, bleeding and hematoma occurred in 2 flap lobes and local infection occurred in 5 flap lobes, which were improved after management. Vascular crisis occurred in 4 flap lobes, and exploratory surgeries were performed, after which 2 lobes survived, while the other 2 lobes necrotized and were repaired by other methods. The rest flap lobes survived well. After each postoperative follow-up of 3 to 60 months, the flap covering areas of the limbs were well-recovered. At the last follow-up, the function evaluation score of 20 affected upper limbs was 85 (63, 90) points, and the score of patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery was (4.4\\xc2\\xb10.7) points. A total of 30 flap lobes were obtained in 14 surgeries and repaired 30 wounds respectively in multiple wounds group, and 16 flap lobes were obtained in 7 surgeries and were spliced to repair 7 large irregular wounds in single wound group. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of anastomosed artery or vein in each surgery, and the duration of each surgery between multiple wounds group and single wound group (Z=0.240, 0.081, t=0.180, P>0.05), and the condition of skin grafting in the donor sites and the postoperative survival of the flap lobes in multiple wounds group were similar to those in single wound group (P>0.05). A total of 22 flap lobes were obtained in 10 surgeries and repaired 18 wounds in early group, and 24 flap lobes were obtained in 11 surgeries and repaired 19 wounds in late group. The incidence of postoperative hematoma, infection, vascular crisis, and survival of flap lobes in early group were similar to those in late group (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the patients' satisfaction degree with the therapeutic effect of each surgery at the last follow-up between early group and late group (t=0.701, P>0.05). At the last follow-up, the function evaluation score of 9 upper limbs in early group was 90 (85, 97) points, significantly higher than 80 (40, 85) points of 11 upper limbs in late group (Z=2.431, P<0.05). Conclusions: Free lobulated anterolateral thigh perforator flap is suitable for simultaneous repair of multiple electric burn wounds of limbs, as well as the repair of a single large irregular wound. It has the clinical advantages of less damage to the donor site and good repair quality. The early flap transplantation is beneficial to improve the function of limbs with electric burns. labels: #Adult#Burns, Electric#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Perforator Flap#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Thigh#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult"
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of osteogenic differentiation and the expression of histone demethylases KDM6B in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in diabetic environment.METHODS: Diabetic model rats was successfully established, and BMSCs from diabetic model rats and normal rats were isolated and cultured for further study. When cultured cells, we added high concentration of glucose and advanced glycosylation products (AGE) in the medium to imitating the diabetic environment. BMSCs were divided into 6 groups: diabetes group (derived from diabets SD rats), normal group (derived from normal SD rats), high glucose group (30 mmol/L D-glucose), normal glucose group (5.5 mmol/L D-glucose), AGE group (AGE 300 \\xc3\\xacg/mL) and BSA group (BSA 300 \\xc3\\xacg/mL). BMSCs in diabetes group were derived from diabetes SD rats, while others were derived from normal SD rats. After 7 d of osteogenic induction, the cells were examined the ability of osteogenic differentiation by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, the transcription levels of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and KDM6B were determined by RT-PCR, and the expression levels of H3K27Me3 protein were examined by Western bolt.RESULTS: Compared with the control groups, the numbers of ALP stained cells and the mRNA levels of Runx2 and KDM6B in diabetes group, high glucose group and AGE group were all decreased (P < 0.05), while H3K27Me3 protein expression levels were all increased (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The ability of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in diabetic environment was weakened, and the expression of Runx2 mRNA was inhibited, which may be related to the increased expression of H3K27Me3 after the inhibition of KDM6B expression. labels: #Animals#Bone Marrow Cells#Cell Differentiation#Cells, Cultured#Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit#Diabetes Mellitus#Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases#Mesenchymal Stem Cells#Osteoblasts#Osteogenesis#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Objective: To investigate the changes of perioperative immune index in patients with breast cancer and its clinical significance. Methods: Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th1/Th2 ratio and regulatory T cells (Treg) were detected in peripheral blood of 103 patients with primary breast cancer and 116 patients with breast fibroma before surgery and on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day following operation. The relationship of changes in T lymphocyte subsets and clinicopathological characteristics, as well as tumor-free survival of breast cancer patients, was analyzed. Results: The levels of Th1 cells in breast cancer group on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day following operation were (12.20\\xc2\\xb10.45)%, (13.89\\xc2\\xb10.47)%, (14.04\\xc2\\xb10.49)%, which were significantly lower than those before operation [(15.82 + 0.51)%, all P<0.05 ]. Treg cells, however, with the number of (3.82\\xc2\\xb10.13)%, (3.25\\xc2\\xb10.11)%, (2.95 \\xc2\\xb10.11)%, were remarkably higher than those before operation [(2.53 \\xc2\\xb10.11)%, all P<0.05]. With respect to breast fibroma patients, there was no significant difference compared with those before operation of Th1 cells, Th2 cells and Treg cells (all P>0.05). The changes of Th1 cells were associated with the degree of differentiation, T stage, N stage, TNM stage, HER-2 status and Ki-67 (all P<0.05). Treg cells were related to T stage, N stage and HER-2 status (all P<0.05). Tumor-free survival in the Th1-cell-increasing group was significantly better than that in the Th1-cell-decreasing group (P=0.045), while cell-decreasing group of Treg showed the improved outcomes (P=0.012). Conclusions: The levels of Th1 cells and Treg cells are important indicators of cellular immune function in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, the perioperative changes of Th1 cells and Treg cells are associated with the size of tumors, pathological parameters, clinical stages and tumor-free survival outcomes. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Immunity, Cellular#T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory#Th1-Th2 Balance'
b"OBJECTIVE: To establish SNaPShot-fluorescence capillary analysis (SNaPShot-FCA) assay for rapid detection of the genotype of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2) rs671 locus.METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells. Using R6G-ddATP and cy5-ddGTP as fluorescent substrates, the ALDH2 gene was amplified by SNaPShot to generate DNA products with different fluorescent dyes at the 3' end. FCA was used to detect the products separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered by gel recovery kit, and the genetype of ALDH2 polymorphism was analyzed by fluorescence spectrum. The samples were tested three times repeatedly and compared with the results of DNA sequencing.RESULTS: The optimal concentrations of R6G-ddATP and cy5-ddGTP were 1.4 \\xc3\\xacmol/L and 8.0 \\xc3\\xacmol/L, respectively. 106 samples were tested for ALDH2 genotype by SNaPShot-FCA under optimal conditions, including 67 of wild type (GG), 38 of hybrid type (AG), and 1 of mutant type (AA), which were consistent with the sequencing results.CONCLUSION: This study successfully established the SNaPShot-FCA for the micro-detection of ALDH2 genotype for the rapid screening and identification of ALDH2 gene. labels: #Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial#Fluorescence#Genotype#Humans#Sequence Analysis, DNA"
b'This article reports the clinical features and C12orf65 gene mutations of a girl with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-55. The 8-year-old girl experienced disease onset at the age of 5 years and had optic atrophy as the main clinical manifestation, with slow movements in standing up and a slight duck-shaped gait. Peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from this child and her parents and brother to perform high-throughput whole-exome sequencing and high-throughput mitochondrial genome sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed for verification. The results showed two compound heterozygous mutations, c.394C>T and c.447_449delGGAinsGT, in the C12orf65 gene. The former mutation came from her father and was a known pathogenic mutation, and the latter came from her mother and was a novel mutation which had not been reported in literature. This study expands the mutation spectrum of the C12orf65 gene and thus provides a molecular basis for the etiological diagnosis of the child and the genetic counseling of the family. labels: #Child#Female#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Male#Mitochondrial Proteins#Mutation#Pedigree#Peptide Termination Factors#Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary'

b'Dunaliella, a commercially important chlorophyte, is globally distributed in saline habitats. Morphological species have not been definitively reconciled with phylogenetic analyses. Considerable genetic diversity continues to be discovered in new isolates, especially from soil and benthic habitats. Twenty-nine new isolates from Great Salt Lake, Utah, many from benthic or supralittoral habitats, were phylogenetically analyzed using ITS1+5.8S+ITS2 in comparison to a broad sampling of available sequences. A few new isolates align in one branch of a bifurcated monophyletic Dunaliella\\xc2\\xa0salina clade and several cluster within monophyletic D.\\xc2\\xa0viridis. Several others align with relatively few unnamed strains from other locations, comprising a diverse clade that may represent two or more new species. The overall Dunaliella clade is relatively robust, but the nearest outgroups are ambiguously placed with extremely long branches. About half of the isolates, all from benthic or supralittoral habitats, have been persistently sarcinoid in liquid media since isolation. This trait is spread across the Dunaliella phylogeny. The morphology of two sarcinoid strains was documented with light microscopy, revealing an extensive glycocalyx. Clumping behavior of unicellular and sarcinoid strains was unaffected by presence or absence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ , addition of lectin-inhibiting monosaccharides, or water-soluble factors from morphologically opposite strains. Results from this investigation have significantly expanded our current understanding of Dunaliella diversity, but it seems likely that much remains to be discovered with additional sampling. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Natural astaxanthin mainly derives from a microalgae producer, Haematococcus pluvialis. The induction of nitrogen starvation and high light intensity is particularly significant for boosting astaxanthin production. However, the different responses to light intensity and nitrogen starvation needed to be analyzed for biomass growth and astaxanthin accumulation. The results showed that the highest level of astaxanthin production was achieved in nitrogen starvation, and was 1.64 times higher than the control group at 11 days. With regard to the optimization of light intensity utilization, it was at 200 \\xc3\\xacmo/m\\xc2\\xb2/s under nitrogen starvation that the highest astaxanthin productivity per light intensity was achieved. In addition, both high light intensity and a nitrogen source had significant effects on multiple indicators. For example, high light intensity had a greater significant effect than a nitrogen source on biomass dry weight, astaxanthin yield and astaxanthin productivity; in contrast, nitrogen starvation was more beneficial for enhancing astaxanthin content per dry weight biomass. The data indicate that high light intensity synergizes with nitrogen starvation to stimulate the biosynthesis of astaxanthin. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The current commercial production of natural astaxanthin is mainly carried out using Haematococcus pluvialis vegetative cells in the "two-stage" batch mode. The motile vegetative cells are more sensitive to stress than nonmotile vegetative cells, thereby affecting the overall astaxanthin productivity in H. pluvialis cultures. In this study, we compared the differences between motile cells and nonmotile cells in astaxanthin productivity, morphological changes, the mortality rate, and the diameter of the formed cysts. The experimental design was achieved by two different types H. pluvialis cell under continuous light of 80 \\xc3\\xacmol photons m-2 s-1 for a 9-day induction period. The highest astaxanthin concentration of 48.42 \\xc2\\xb1 3.13\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg L-1 was obtained in the nonmotile cell cultures with the highest the productivity of 5.04 \\xc2\\xb1 0.15\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg L-1 day-1, which was significantly higher than that in the motile cell cultures. The microscopic examination of cell morphological showed a large number of photooxidative damaged cells occurring in the motile cell cultures, resulting in higher cell mortality rate (22.2 \\xc2\\xb1 3.97%) than nonmotile cell cultures (9.6 \\xc2\\xb1 0.63%). In addition, the analysis results of cell diameter statistics indicated that nonmotile cells were more conducive to the formation of large astaxanthin-rich cysts than motile cells. In conclusion, the works presented here suggest that the accumulation of astaxanthin was significantly improved by nonmotile cells of H. pluvialis, which provided a possibility of optimizing the existing H. pluvialis cultivation strategy for the industrial production. labels: #Chlorophyceae'

Lipid productivity and lipid content were around 43.7% and 33.7% higher, respectively in UV-A treatment compared to the control. Moreover, gene-expression patterns related to antioxidant defense and intracellular ROS levels indicated that UV-A affected certain ROS and antioxidants pathways and successfully induced the lipid accumulation in Ettlia sp. This strategy to activate lipid accumulation can be applied in other microalgae without affecting their growth. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Strongyloidiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis whose treatment is particularly difficult in immunosuppressed patients due to their low responsiveness to conventional therapy. Carica papaya and its isolated compounds benzyl isothiocyanate, carpaine and carpasemine are promising compound for the treatment of Strongyloides infections due to their anthelmintic action. This study aims to examine the in vitro ovicidal and larvicidal activity of C. papaya seed hexane extract against Strongyloides venezuelensis, using egg hatching tests and larval motility tests as efficiency markers. The crude extract at the concentrations of 566 - 0.0566 mg/mL or the control with albendazole (0.025 mg/mL) and negative controls (water and PBS) were incubated with an equal volume of egg suspension (\\xc2\\xb1 50 specimens) followed by counting of the specimens after 48 h. The same extract and dilutions were added to L3 larvae suspensions (\\xc2\\xb150 specimens) followed by analysis of larvae viability after 24, 48, and 72 h. The extract inhibited egg hatching with high efficiency at concentrations of 56.6 mg/mL (95.74%) and 5.66 mg/mL (92.16%). At the concentrations of 566 mg/mL (100%) and 56.66 mg/mL (97.32%), the extract inhibited larval motility as effectively as ivermectin (0.316 mg/mL; 100%), and more effectively than the other dilutions and the negative controls. The larvicidal effect depended on the extract concentration, but not on the treatment period. Therefore, C. papaya seed hexane extract has anthelmintic potential against S. venezuelensis and is a promising compound for the development of phytotherapies to treat strongyloidiasis. labels: #Animals#Carica#Larva#Ovum#Parasitic Sensitivity Tests#Plant Extracts#Seeds#Strongyloides'
b'PURPOSE: This prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial evaluated the relationship between alveolar ridge dimensional change and recession with the implant position (horizontal and vertical) and tissue phenotype in immediately placed and provisionalised implants without the use of bone grafting.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 40) with a hopeless maxillary anterior tooth received an immediate implant and immediate provisional or customised healing abutment after flapless extraction. Implants were finally restored 3 months after placement and followed up for 6 months after delivery of the restoration. The alveolar ridge dimensional change and recession were measured using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and digitalised dental casts. Alveolar contour changes were correlated to implant position and tissue phenotype.RESULTS: The tissue phenotype showed no significant correlation to the alveolar ridge dimensional change. At 6 months, the average alveolar ridge dimensional change was approximately 0.7 mm in the buccolingual dimension independent of tissue phenotype. A statistically significant difference was observed on the recession values comparing tissue phenotypes, with more recession observed in the thin phenotype (1.96 mm) than in the thick phenotype (1.18 mm). A significant correlation was observed between horizontal implant position and buccolingual alveolar ridge change. A positive correlation was observed between the horizontal implant position and the dimensional change measured in the casts at the level of the free gingival margin. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the horizontal implant position and the resorption measured by the CBCT scans.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thin tissue phenotype had a more marked recession. The horizontal implant position showed a relationship to the alveolar ridge dimensional changes observed. The greater the buccal gap distance between the implant and the buccal plate, the lesser the radiographic changes observed in the alveolar bone, however, the greater the changes observed in the buccal aspect of the casts at the level of the free gingival margin. labels: #Alveolar Process#Dental Implants, Single-Tooth#Gingival Recession#Humans#Phenotype#Prospective Studies'
b'An 11-year-old girl was found to have pale complexion and anemia with gradual aggravation for one year. She was weak in the past and developed pneumonia in the right middle lung 3-5 times per year, which was improved after anti-infective therapy. She and her mother had congenital deaf-mutism. Physical examination showed the appearance of anemia, without bleeding, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, or lymph node enlargement. Routine blood test results showed reductions in all three blood cell lines, normocytic anemia, and megaloblastoid change in granulocytic and erythroid cell lines in bone marrow, with no obvious increase in primitive cells or metastatic tumor cells. Whole exome sequencing indicated the presence of a known pathogenic mutation for Emberger syndrome (ES), c.1084C>T (p.Arg362*) in the GATA2 gene. The girl was finally diagnosed with ES, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progressed to acute myeloid leukemia during follow-up. ES is a rare type of MDS with autosomal dominant inheritance in clinical practice, and it is difficult to make a confirmed diagnosis. ES should be considered for children with unexplained lymphedema and congenital deafness, and gene detection should be performed to make a confirmed diagnosis. labels: #Anemia#Child#Female#GATA2 Transcription Factor#Humans#Lymphedema#Mutism#Myelodysplastic Syndromes'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term prognosis of vesicoureteral reflux in children.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 138 children (218 ureters with reflux) who were diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux for the first time from November 2005 to March 2017 and received medical treatment and regular follow-up. According to the initial grade of reflux, the ureters with reflux were divided into a low-grade group (141 ureters, grade I-III) and a high-grade group (77 ureters, grade IV-V), and the two groups were compared in terms of clinical data and follow-up results.RESULTS: Among the 138 children, there were 82 boys and 56 girls. Their age ranged from 31 days to 10 years at the time of confirmed diagnosis, with a median age of 8 months. The follow-up time ranged from 8 months to 7 years, with a median follow-up time of 1.4 years. At the time of confirmed diagnosis, the high-grade group had significantly higher levels of urinary N-acetyl-\\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosaminidase, urinary microalbumin and urinary immunoglobulin G than the low-grade group (P<0.05). Among the 218 ureters with reflux, 132 (60.6%) achieved a reduction in the grade of reflux (among which 74 achieved complete disappearance of reflux), 43 had no change in the grade of reflux, and 43 had an increase in the grade of reflux. Compared with the high-grade group, the low-grade group had a significantly higher complete remission rate (41.1% vs 19.5%, P=0.001) and a significantly shorter time to complete remission of reflux (P=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Most children with vesicoureteral reflux can achieve a reduction in the grade of reflux or even complete disappearance of reflux during follow-up, and the children with low-grade reflux have better prognosis than those with high-grade reflux. labels: #Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Follow-Up Studies#Humans#Infant#Male#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Vesico-Ureteral Reflux'
b"Introduction: M?ni?re's disease (MD) is a disorder that affects the inner ear, characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and vegetative symptoms. One of the main points of the management of the patients is the analysis of the vertigo diaries. Aim: To identify the typical characteristics of the symptoms and to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary approach. Material and method: 58 (12 male and 46 females, mean age 56.97 \\xc2\\xb1 10.45 SD) definite MD patients were enrolled in this investigation. The vertigo diaries filled out by the patients were analysed. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS V24 software. Since the parameters did not show normal distribution, non parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test) was used. Results: Based on the diaries, the most tormenting symptom is vertigo (mean power: 5.38 \\xc2\\xb1 2.06 SD), the second one is tinnitus (4.54 \\xc2\\xb1 2.81 SD), and last one is headache (2.77 \\xc2\\xb1 3.1 SD). Despite the frequent prevalence of associated headache, vestibular migraine could be ruled out in all of the cases. Another important outcome was that the attacks associated with headache were significantly stronger (p = 0.001). In the case of the vegetative symptoms, the association was even much stronger (p<0.01). According to the narrative analysis, the most frequent provocation factors of the attacks were the cold front and stress. Conclusion: Along with the treatment of vertigo, the management of the associated symptoms (headache, vegetative symptoms) is also of great importance. Monitoring the quality of life and psychiatric disorders suggests the importance of multidisciplinary approach.

b'Nowadays, consumers are more conscious about healthier products consumption benefits. Astaxanthin obtained from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis represents a natural ingredient for the nutraceutical and functional food industries. It is claimed that astaxanthin has much stronger antioxidant activity than vitamin E and \\xc3\\xa2-carotene, providing different health benefits. However, the unstable structure of the molecule limits its application in functional foods development. Therefore, the present study evaluates the effect of five independent formulation and process variables for natural astaxanthin oleoresin encapsulation using an external ionic gelation technique. Response surface methodology can be used for studying the effect of several factors at different levels and their influences on each other, which overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional orthogonal method. The results showed that alginate and CaCl2 concentrations have a significant effect on particles size obtained, while alginate/oleoresin ratio and surfactant concentration greatly influence the astaxanthin oleoresin release rate. In vitro studies under simulated intestinal conditions showed that astaxanthin oleoresin release process can be described by Hopfenberg model. Three mathematical models were obtained for predicting particle size, astaxanthin release rate and encapsulation yield under different process conditions, providing a platform for microencapsulation technology optimization for healthy food design. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To investigate the incidence and related risk factors of ulnar nerve dysfunction after open reduction and internal fixation of humeral intercondylar fractures. Methods: A total of 168 patients who underwent open reduction and plate and screw fixation of a humeral intercondylar fracture between January 2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 85 males and 83 females, aged from 14 to 77 years with a mean age of (43\\xc2\\xb117) years. Diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy was defined as documentation of sensory and motor dysfunction of the ulnar nerve in the medical record. The explanatory (independent) variables included age, gender, injury type, AO typing, time from injury to surgery, surgery approach, plates fixation methods and whether the nerve was transposed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction. Results: Acute injury-related ulnar nerve neuropathy was diagnosed in 12(7.1%) of 168 patients. Among the other 156 patients without preoperative ulnar nerve neuropathy,the total postoperative ulnar neuropathy was found in 52 patients (33.3%), and in 26(16.7%) at the final follow-up, according to the McGowan grades system; 23(88.5%) of 26 patients were clinically graded as grade 1, and 3(11.5%) were graded as grade 2. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that triceps sparing approach (OR=2.639, P=0.039) and parallel double plate fixation (OR=3.089, P=0.046) were associated with a risk of postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction. Conclusion: There is a substantial incidence of postoperative ulnar nerve dysfunction after open reduction and plate and screw fixation of humeral intercondylar fracture, postoperative ulnar neuropathy may occur from the time of injury through the long-term follow-up period, triceps sparing approach and parallel double plate fixation are the risk factors for ulnar neuropathy. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Bone Plates#Female#Fracture Fixation, Internal#Humans#Humeral Fractures#Humerus#Incidence#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors#Treatment Outcome#Ulnar Nerve#Young Adult'
b'STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.BACKGROUND: Inferior facetectomies, with the utilization of segmental pedicle screw constructs for corrective fixation, can provide adequate flexibility and post less risk of neural tissue and blood loss. We analyzed outcomes of surgical treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) using inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs. We hypothesized that adequate main curve correction and suitable surgical outcomes would be observed using this technique.METHODS: We reviewed 38 AIS patients who underwent inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs by 2 surgeons at a single institution between May 2014 and December 2016. Coronal and sagittal radiographic measurements were evaluated over 1-year follow-up by 2 trained observers not associated with the surgeries. Surgical details, complications, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were also recorded.RESULTS: Mean fusion levels were 11.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.7. The mean Cobb angle of main AIS curves improved from 48.6\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a10.1 degree preoperatively to 11.8\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a6.2 degree postoperatively and 12.4\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a6.2 degree at 1-year follow-up, which percentage correction was 75.9% and 74.6%, respectively. The mean thoracic kyphosis (T5-12) angle was 20.7\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a11.6 degree preoperatively, 17.4\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a8.0 degree postoperatively, and 16.8\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a8.4 degree at 1-year follow-up. The mean surgical time, estimated blood loss, and LOS were 232.4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a35.7\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes, 475.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a169.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, and 3.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.3 days. Twelve patients received blood transfusion. There were no neurological or wound complications.CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrated adequate correction of main AIS curves, acceptable thoracic kyphosis and blood loss, and short surgical time and LOS in AIS patients treated with inferior facetectomies and segmental pedicle screw constructs, potentially indicating that inferior facetectomies are adequate and suitable for AIS surgery when segmental pedicle screw constructs are utilized. labels: #Adolescent#Female#Humans#Male#Orthopedic Procedures#Pedicle Screws#Retrospective Studies#Scoliosis#Spine#Treatment Outcome'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of different courses of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention on recognition memory and the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells in mice with radiation-induced brain injury, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improving radiation-induced brain injury.METHODS: Se-venty 30-day old C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups, and the latter two groups were further divided into 1 week (W), 2 W and 3 W subgroups (n=10 in the control group and each subgroup). The ra-diation-induced brain injury model was established by radiating the mouse\\\' left head at a dose of 8 Gy for 10 min by using a radiation linear accelerator. EA (1.5 V, 2 Hz/10 Hz) was applied to "Baihui" (GV20), "Fengfu" (GV14) and bilateral "Shenshu" (BL23) for 30 min, once daily for 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. The learning-cognition memory ability was detected by using novel object recognition test in an open test box to record the time for exploring a novel object (TN) and a familiar object and to calculate the recognition index (RI). The neural stem cells\\\' proliferation and differentiation in the hippocampus tissues were evaluated by counting the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells, neuronal nuclei (NeuN)/BrdU-positive cells and BrdU/glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells under microscope after immunofluorescence stain.RESULTS: After modeling, the TN at 90 min and 24 h and RI of the model subgroup 3 W at 90 min and RI of the model subgroup 1, 2 and 3 W at 24 h were significantly decreased in comparison with those of the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). Moreover, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the model subgroup 1 W and 2 W, the BrdU/NeuN double-labeled cells in the 3 model subgroups and BrdU/GFAP double-labeled cells in the model subgroup 1 W and 3 W were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05). Following EA interventions, the TN in the 3 EA subgroups at both 90 min and 24 h, and RI of EA subgroup 3 W at 90 min and EA subgroup 2 W and 3 W at 24 h were considerably increased compared with those of the corresponding 3 model subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The numbers of BrdU-positive cells as well as BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP double-labeled cells were significantly increased in the 3 EA subgroups (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.001).CONCLUSION: EA of GV20, GV14 and BL23 can improve the recognition memory ability of mice with radiation-induced brain injury, which may be related to its effect in promoting the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the hippocampus. labels: #Animals#Brain Injuries#Cell Differentiation#Cell Proliferation#Electroacupuncture#Hippocampus#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Neural Stem Cells'
b'This study examined the effects of a bacterial community and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on Ettlia sp. flocculation. The growth rate, flocculation efficiency (FE), bacterial community, and EPS profile of axenic and xenic Ettlia cultures were monitored during 46\\xe2\\x80\\xafdays of cultivation. For the xenic culture, with a great abundance of growth-promoting and flocculation-inducing bacteria, the biomass density was 18.75% higher and its FE reached 100% in the mid-stationary phase. Moreover, microscopic observation and a quantitative analysis of the EPS revealed the exclusive presence of long filamentous EPS and more compact structure in the xenic Ettlia culture, possibly explaining its better FE. Notwithstanding, for the axenic culture, despite a lower biomass density and reduced abundance of EPS, its FE reached 92.54% in the mid-stationary phase. Thus, the role of the bacterial community was found to be supportive rather than vital for the high settleability of the self-flocculating Ettlia microalgal culture. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Pursuing the widespread interest on multi-target drugs to combat Alzheimer?s disease (AD), a new series of hybrids was designed and developed based on the repositioning of the well-known acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, tacrine (TAC), by its coupling to benzofuran (BF) derivatives. The BF framework aims to endow the conjugate molecules with ability for inhibition of AChE (bimodal way) and of amyloid-beta peptide aggregation, besides providing metal (Fe, Cu) chelating ability and concomitant extra anti-oxidant activity, for the hybrids with hydroxyl substitution. The new TAC-BF conjugates showed very good activity for AChE inhibition (sub-micromolar range) and good capacity for the inhibition of self- and Cu-mediated A\\xc3\\xa2 aggregation, with dependence on the linker size and substituent groups of each main moiety. Neuroprotective effects were also found for the compounds through viability assays of neuroblastoma cells, after A\\xc3\\xa21-42 induced toxicity.

After hypoxic (1%O2) or DMOG, CoCl2 treatments mimicking the hypoxic treatment, Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to examine the HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 expression in mitochondria of HeLa and ACHN cells, respectively. ?The protease sensitivity experiment was used to explore the sub-organelle localization of HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 in mitochondria. ?Western blot was used to examine mitochondrial HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 in the normal mouse tissues and human liver carcinoma tissues.RESULTS: ? In HeLa and ACHN cells, HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 translocated to mitochondria under normoxia and hypoxia, and its mitochondrial expression was higher under hypoxia; ?The protease sensitivity of HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 was similar to proteins locating in the mitochondrial outer membrane; ?Mitochondrial HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 expressed in multiple normal mouse tissues; The expression of mitochondrial HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 was higher in human liver carcinoma tissues than the normal and adjacent tissues.CONCLUSIONS: HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 translocated to mitochondrial outer membrane under both normoxia and hypoxia, and hypoxia could up-regulated HIF-3\\xc3\\xa1 mitochondrial translocation.

b'The present study investigated how principal environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity change the toxicological properties of thiobencarb (TB) herbicide to the green alga, Raphidocelis subcapitata. At first, we investigated the inhibitory effect of TB (0, 15.6, 31.2, 62.4, and 125\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\xacg\\xc2\\xa0L-1) on growth of R. subcapitata at five temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, or 30\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb0C) for 144\\xc2\\xa0h exposure and calculated 72- and 144-h effective concentration values (EC10, 20, and EC50) for growth rate. All EC values significantly decreased with an increasing temperature. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II in R. subcapitata exposed to 125\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\xacg\\xc2\\xa0L-1 of TB was also significantly inhibited with increased temperature. These physiological effects could explain the lower EC values at high temperatures. Then, single and interactive effects of TB, temperature, and light intensity on growth rate were investigated by three-way of analysis of variance. As a result, single and interactive effects were detected in all explanatory variables. These results suggest that temperature and light intensity change the acute toxicity parameter in R. subcapitata exposed to TB and must be considered in evaluating the risk of TB. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To explore related factors affecting evolution of recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI) with small-artery occlusion. Methods: A total of 96 RSSI patients with RSSI were admitted from Shanghai Tongji Hospital between January 2015 and December 2018. The age of patients containing 60 men was 64.5 (58-73) years, and MRI follow-up time was 11.6 (6.3-11.8) months. Clinical information of patients, images data at baseline head MRI and evolution outcomes at follow-up MRI were collected. All patients were divided into cavitation group (lacunes) and no cavitation group (white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and disappearance) to analyze related factors. Results: Fifty-nine cases (61.5%) developed to cavities, 32 cases (33.3%) were focal WMH, and 5 cases (5.2%) disappeared.In the univariate analysis, RSSI maximum diameter on the DWI or T(2)WI sequence of cavitation group was significantly higher than non-cavitation group, but male proportion was lower (11.6 (9.9-16.6) vs 8.6 (6.9-13.0) mm, 11.8 (9.7-16.2) vs 8.8 (6.7-13.1) mm, 54.2% vs 75.7%, all P<0.05). In Logistic regression analysis,the maximum diameter on DWI sequence was an independent predictor of cavity formation (P=0.022,OR=1.138).When conducting quantitative analysis of infarct diameter and taking infarct maximum diameter ?10 mm group as reference, the cavitation risk of maximum diameter>15 mm group was about 7.5 times higher (P=0.010, OR=7.464). The maximum diameter of 10-15 mm lost predictive value for cavity formation (P=0.129, OR=2.444). Conclusions: About 61.5% of RSSI develop to cavitation and 38.5% to WMH or disappear. The RSSI showing larger diameter on DWI has a greater possibility of cavitation. labels: #Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases#China#Female#Humans#Leukoaraiosis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male'
b'Objective: To investigate the alterations of the cerebral resting-state spontaneous neural activity in colorectal cancer patients with depressive symptoms. Methods: Thirty-three colorectal cancer patients (patient group) with depression and 43 healthy subjects (control group) underwent the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were calculated. Two independent samples t test were used to compare the ALFF and fALFF values between two groups by DPABI software, and then correlation analysis was performed between ALFF and fALFF with statistical significance and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scores. Results: Compared with the control group, the patient group showed significantly lower ALFF and fALFF values in the bilateral precuneus, calcarine gyrus, lingual gyrus, left cuneus, superior, middle, inferior occipital gyrus and right fusiform gyrus (t=-5.730, P<0.05; t=-4.872, P<0.05). There were no significant correlations between the ALFF and fALFF values in these regions and PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores (P>0.05). Conclusion: Spontaneous decrease of neural activity in occipital and parietal lobes exists in colorectal cancer patients with depression at resting-sate, which may be a potential neurobiological marker. labels: #Biomarkers#Brain#Case-Control Studies#Colorectal Neoplasms#Depression#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging'
b'Haematococcus pluvialis microalgae in the red phase can produce significant amounts of astaxanthin, lutein, and fatty acids (FAs), which are valuable antioxidants in nutraceutics and cosmetics. Extraction of astaxanthin, lutein, and FAs from disrupted biomass of the H. pluvialis red phase using carbon dioxide (CO\\xe2\\x82\\x82) in supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) conditions was investigated using a bench-scale reactor in a semi-batch configuration. In particular, the effect of extraction time (20, 40, 60, 80, and 120 min), CO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 flow rate (3.62 and 14.48 g/min) temperature (50, 65, and 80 \\xc2\\xb0C), and pressure (100, 400, and 550 bar.) was explored. The results show the maximum recovery of astaxanthin and lutein achieved were 98.6% and 52.3%, respectively, at 50 \\xc2\\xb0C and 550 bars, while the maximum recovery of FAs attained was 93.2% at 65 \\xc2\\xb0C and 550 bars. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae are affected by the amount of light received. This parameter can be controlled by changing the light source and altering the reactor used for their growth. In this study, the effect of different colors of light was analyzed in the growth of Dunaliella tertiolecta, observing that blue lighting systems reached a biomass 10 times superior to the one generated by orange lightning systems. This growth effect was seen in a novel tubular internally illuminated photobioreactor. In this photobioreactor, the blue reactor produced 1.7 times the biomass of the red reactor, with the particularity that the latter showed an oscillating behavior in its growth. From irradiance models, the light dispersion coefficient is higher than the absorption coefficient when using red light. In contrast, with blue light, the value of the scattering coefficient is almost null. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Dunaliella salina is a green microalgae species industrially exploited for its capacity to produce important amounts of carotenoid pigments. However in low nitrogen conditions in which they produce these pigments, their concentration is low, which results in harvesting difficulties and high costs. In this work, we propose a new solution to efficiently harvest D.\\xc2\\xa0salina at the pre-industrial scale, using flocculation/flotation harvesting induced by NaOH addition in the medium. We first show, using numerical simulations and nanoscale atomic force spectroscopy experiments, that sweeping mechanism in formed magnesium hydroxide precipitate is only responsible for D.\\xc2\\xa0salina flocculation in hypersaline culture medium upon NaOH addition. Based on this understanding of the flocculation mechanism, we then evaluate the influence of several parameters related to NaOH mixing and magnesium hydroxide precipitation and show that NaOH concentration, mixing, and salinity of the medium can be optimized to achieve high flocculation/flotation harvesting efficiencies in laboratory-scale experiments. We finally successfully scale-up the data obtained at lab-scale to a continuous pre-industrial flotation pilot, and achieve up to 80% of cell recovery. This interdisciplinary study thus provides original results, from the nano to the pre-industrial scale, which allow the successful development of an efficient large-scale D.\\xc2\\xa0salina harvesting process. We thus anticipate our results to be the starting point for further optimization and industrial use of this flocculation/flotation harvesting technique. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Development of therapeutic preparations involves several steps, starting with the synthesis of chemical compounds and testing them in different models for selecting the most effective and safest ones to clinical trials and introduction into medical practice. Cultured animal cells (both primary and transformed) are commonly used as models for compound screening. However, cell models display a number of disadvantages, including insufficient standardization (primary cells) and disruption of cell genotypes (transformed cells). Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) offers new possibilities for the development of high-throughput test systems for screening potential therapeutic preparations with different activity spectra. Due to the capacity to differentiate into all cell types of an adult organism, IPSCs are a unique model that allows examining the activity and potential toxicity of tested compounds during the entire differentiation process in vitro. In this work, we demonstrated the efficiency of IPSCs and their neuronal derivatives for selecting substances with the neuroprotective activity using two classes of compounds - melanocortin family peptides and endocannabinoids. None of the tested compounds displayed cyto- or embryotoxicity. Both melanocortin peptides and endocannabinoids exerted neuroprotective effect in the neuronal precursors and IPSC-derived neurons subjected to hydrogen peroxide. The endocannabinoid N-docosahexaenoyl dopamine exhibited the highest neuroprotective effect (~70%) in the differentiated cultures enriched with dopaminergic neurons; the effect of melanocortin Semax was ~40%. The possibility of using other IPSC derivatives for selecting compounds with the neuroprotective activity is discussed. labels: #Cell Differentiation#Cell Proliferation#Cells, Cultured#Dopaminergic Neurons#Embryoid Bodies#Endocannabinoids#Humans#Hydrogen Peroxide#Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells#Melanocortins#Neuroprotective Agents#Oxidative Stress'
b'RATIONALE: Vaginal stone is a rare condition that is often misdiagnosed due to its low incidence. It can be divided into 2 types, primary vaginal and secondary vaginal, based on the etiology of the disease. Vaginal stones involve pathologic calcification. The formation of vaginal stones is mainly due to stasis and urine infection. We describe a procedure for the safe extraction of vaginal stones.PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 25-year-old female patient with congenital genitourinary malformation and urethrovaginal fistula. A urogenital tract malformation repair operation was performed before she was 21 years old. Frequency of urination occurred before and after menstruation for 9 years, and dyspareunia occurred for 1 year.DIAGNOSES: B ultrasound examination showed a 59\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a55\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a23\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm fusiform region of increased signal intensity in the vagina followed by a sound shadow. We performed a gynecologic examination and found that the long diameter of the vaginal opening was 20\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm. A brown substance observed in her vagina had a hard texture and felt like a stone, and a palpation hand test revealed the size was approximately 60\\xe2\\x80\\x8a?\\xe2\\x80\\x8a50\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm. A cystoscope was inserted into the urethra and revealed that the broken end of the urethra was connected to the vagina. The proximal broken end of the urethra was 20\\xe2\\x80\\x8amm from the distal end.INTERVENTIONS: The purpose of this operation was to make a definite diagnosis and remove the stones. We performed vaginal stone removal surgery and cystoscopy under anesthesia.OUTCOMES: We removed the stone successfully. The patient was discharged from the hospital after a smooth recovery without any complications. Follow-up was conducted 1 month after the operation and then every 3 months.LESSONS: Although vaginal stones are rare, we must pay attention to this disease, especially in patients with congenital genitourinary malformations and urethrovaginal or vesicovaginal fistulas. Obstruction of urine discharge combined with repeated urinary tract infection is the main cause of vaginal stone formation. For these patients, follow-up every 3 months, including a physical examination, B-mode ultrasonography of the urinary system and cystoscopy if necessary, can avoid the occurrence of the disease. labels: #Adult#Calculi#Female#Humans#Urethral Diseases#Urinary Fistula#Vaginal Diseases#Vaginal Fistula'
b"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of different courses of electroacupuncture treatment on the compliance and therapeutic outcome of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis.METHODS: A total of 60 patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis were randomly divided into 5-time treatment group and 10-time treatment group, with 30 patients in each group. With the same electroacupuncture prescription, the patients in the 5-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 5 times in total, and those in the 10-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 10 times in total, with an interval of 2 days between every 5 times of treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of cervical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis before and after treatment, as well as whether and why the patients were willing to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment. The two groups were followed up to observe the recurrence of cervical spondylosis within 12 months.RESULTS: Both groups had significant improvements in cervical VAS score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis after treatment (P<0.05), and there were no significant differences in these scores between the two groups after treatment (P>0.05). There was also no significant difference in long-term recurrence between the two groups (P>0.05). Of the 30 patients in the 10-time treatment group, 21 (70%) showed no willingness to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment since they were satisfied with their treatment outcomes.CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can effectively improve the pain symptom of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis, and compared with 5 times of electroacupuncture treatment, 10 times of electroacupuncture treatment may affect patients' compliance with clinical treatment. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Electroacupuncture#Humans#Spondylosis#Treatment Outcome"
b'BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of nosocomial infections. This species is characterised by the presence of pandemic lineages (International Clones) that present a broad antimicrobial resistance profile.OBJECTIVE: To perform the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from a clinical setting in the Amazon Basin, and to characterise their antimicrobial resistance determinants.METHODS: The genetic relationship of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Class A, B and D \\xc3\\xa2-lactamase genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile was obtained by Disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination.FINDINGS: All carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains belonged to three international clones, IC-1, IC-5 and IC-6, the latter recently reported by the first time in Brazil. The major determinant of carbapenem resistance in IC-1 and IC-5 strains was bla OXA-23, associated with ISAba1 and ISAba3, respectively, while IC-6 harboured the bla OXA-72.CONCLUSIONS: The A. baumannii epidemiology in Brazilian Amazon Region was unknown. It was demonstrated that A. baumannii XDR international clones were responsible for nosocomial infections in Boa Vista during 2016-2018, revealing that the epidemiological scenario of A. baumannii infections in Amazon Region resembles those from the cosmopolitan regions worldwide. labels: #Acinetobacter Infections#Acinetobacter baumannii#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Brazil#Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field#Genotype#Humans#Multilocus Sequence Typing#Phenotype#beta-Lactamases'
b'PURPOSE: To analyse and compare the dimensional changes of unassisted extraction sockets with alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) techniques and investigate any factors that impact the resorption of the alveolar bone.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs). All data were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed for the changes in all buccolingual ridge width, midbuccal and midlingual ridge height, and mesial and distal ridge height, and horizontal width at reference points apical to the crestal area.RESULTS: Based on 14 RCTs, the effectiveness of ARP in reducing the dimensions of the postextraction alveolar socket was confirmed. The clinical magnitude of this effect was 1.95 mm in the buccolingual ridge width, 1.62 mm in the midbuccal ridge height, and 1.26 mm on the midlingual ridge height. Additionally, 0.45 mm and 0.34 mm for mesial and distal ridge height, and 1.21 mm, and 0.76 mm for ridge width changes at points 3 and 5 mm apical to the crest were noted. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the reflection of flaps and primary wound coverage during ARP may have detrimental effects on bone remodelling, while no statistical significance was observed for any of the bone graft substitutes or the percentage of molar sockets.CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the protocol, ARP can only minimise ridge resorption. ARP is most effective on horizontal ridge width, providing the most benefit coronally (approximating the crest), followed by the midbuccal ridge height. labels: #Alveolar Process#Alveolar Ridge Augmentation#Consensus#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Tooth Extraction#Tooth Socket'
b'Lubricious polymer coatings are increasingly used on intravascular devices to facilitate easier access and navigation through tortuous blood vessels. Recent reports highlight the separation and downstream embolism of polymer particles affecting the vasculature and various organs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledges polymer coating embolism as an iatrogenic complication of intravascular devices and continues to close gaps in standards related to coating integrity. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation established particulate testing as an industry standard for evaluating coating integrity of intravascular devices. The FDA recognizes this standard; however, challenges exist in setting particulate limits that may compromise device function without sufficient clinical data. The microscopic nature of polymer emboli not visible with available imaging modalities has impacted reporting. This has also resulted in a reduced number of manufacturer-driven product development projects related to coating integrity. On the other hand, recent procedural trends have supported the innovation of coated devices with expanded indications, requiring particulate evaluations and release limits. This article proposes a methodology to set particulate limits for intravascular devices given existing clinical, regulatory, and manufacturing challenges. The approach with standardization requirements enables characterization, comparison, and evaluation of lubricious coatings from various manufacturers. It incorporates a step-by-step procedure that adds scrutiny to the application of coatings while ensuring device function is not impacted. Together with particulate assessments, clinicopathologic and animal studies permit an understanding of particulate ranges from commercially available devices and setting of particulate limits for new device evaluations. labels: #Animals#Coated Materials, Biocompatible#Embolism#Polymers#United States#United States Food and Drug Administration'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis of HL60 cells induced by oncolytic virus Reovirus type 3 (Reo3).METHODS: HL60 cells were infected with Reo3 at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) with the uninfected HL60 cells as control group. After 48 h of infection, the activity of HL60 cells infected with virus at different MOI was detected by CCK8 method to investigate the influence of MOI to cell activity. Simultaneously, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells was detected by flow cytometry, and the activation level of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the expression of apoptotic-related protein in HL60 cells were detected by Western blot. Before infection with Reo3 for 48 h, HL60 cells were treated with 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a specific inhibitor of PKR, for 24 h. Afterward, the apoptotic level and expression of apoptotic related proteins were detected.RESULTS: Activity of HL60 cells was obviously inhibited after infected with Reo3 with a MOI of 1 for 48 h. The cell survival rate was (24.333\\xc2\\xb13.396)% and the apoptotic rate was (29.96\\xc2\\xb12.06)%. Both rates were all higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Western blot results showed that the expression levels of PKR, p-PKR, Bax, Caspase3 and cleaved Caspase3 in HL60 cells infected with Reo3 were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), while the expression level of Bcl-2 was lower (P < 0.05). Compared with the group without inhibitor, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells pretreated with 2-AP decreased (P < 0.05), the phosphorylation level of PKR and the expression level of apoptotic-related protein also decreased (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Oncolytic virus Reo3 could activate PKR in HL60 cells and thus induce apoptosis of HL60 cells. labels: #2-Aminopurine#Apoptosis#Caspase 3#Flow Cytometry#HL-60 Cells#Humans#Mammalian orthoreovirus 3#Oncolytic Viruses#Phosphorylation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2#bcl-2-Associated X Protein#eIF-2 Kinase'
b"Objective: To analyze clinical characteristics and wound repair methods and effects of patients with upper limb electric burns. Methods: Medical records of 136 patients with upper limb electric burn who met the inclusion criteria and hospitalized in our unit from January 2015 to March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Proportion in patients with electric burns in the same period, gender, age, admission time, categories, injury causes, injury voltage, burn area and depth of upper limb, simultaneous injury of both upper limbs, and early wound treatment measure of patients with upper limb electric burn were recorded. The main repair methods of each affected limb were classified and recorded. The overall efficacy of the patients was recorded, including postoperative wound complications and healing condition. The patients repaired with distal pedicled flaps and those with free flaps were followed up for 3 to 6 months. The survival rate of flaps were recorded, the function of affected limbs after operation was evaluated, and the satisfaction degree of patients was investigated by Curative Effect Score Table. The amputation rate, age, and burn area of upper limbs of patients caused by high-voltage and low-voltage electricity were compared. Data were processed with Wilcoxon rank sum test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact probability test. Results: (1) The number of upper limb electric burn patients accounted for 88.3% of 154 patients with electric burns hospitalized in the same period, including 117 males and 19 females, aged 1 year and 2 months to 72 years [(34\\xc2\\xb118) years], admitted 1 h to 48 d after injury, including 51 electricians, 32 rural migrant workers, 31 students and preschool children, and 22 patients belonging to other categories. Patients of the first two categories were mainly injured by work accidents, and those of the latter two categories mainly suffered from touching power source or power leakage. Among all the patients, 75 cases were injured by high-voltage electric burn, and 61 cases were injured by low-voltage electric burn, with burn area of upper limb from 0.2% to 16.0% [2% (1%, 5%)] total body surface area (TBSA) and area of wounds deep to bone from 0.2% to 15.0% [2% (1%, 5%)] TBSA. Two upper limbs in 54 cases were simultaneously injured, accounting for 39.7%. Early fasciotomy was performed for 73 limbs. (2) Thirteen affected limbs were treated with dressing change, 2 affected limbs were sutured directly after debridement, 56 affected limbs were repaired by skin grafting, 12 affected limbs were repaired by local flap, 45 affected limbs were repaired by distal pedicled flap, 22 affected limbs were repaired by free flap, and 40 affected limbs were amputated (accounting for 21.1%). (3) One case died of pulmonary infection, sepsis, and multiple organ failure after operation, and the rest patients were all cured. One case with avulsion of abdominal flap was repaired by skin grafting after dressing change. The anterolateral thigh flap in one case necrotized after transplantation, which was replaced by pedicled abdominal flap. Seven cases had small erosion on the pedicle or margin after transplantation of abdominal flap and were healed by dressing change. Six cases had local bruising at the distal end after transplantation of abdominal flap and were healed after conservative treatment such as hyperbaric oxygen. The other flaps survived well. (4) The survival rate of distal pedicled flap grafting was 97.8% (44/45), which was close to that of free flap grafting (95.5%, 21/22, P>0.05). The function recovery of affected limb after free flap grafting was better than that of distal pedicled flap grafting (Z=-3.054, P<0.01), but their satisfaction degree of patients was similar (Z=-0.474, P>0.05). (5) Patients with high-voltage electric burn had higher amputation rate, older age, and larger upper limb burn area than those with low-voltage electric burn (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=4.743, Z=-2.801, -6.469, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: Upper extremity electric burn often occurs in children, electricians, and rural migrant workers with high rate of amputation. Teachers and parents should strengthen safety education for children and manage power source of life well. Workers should improve safety awareness and operate standardly. Fasciotomy for relaxation should be performed for electric burn wound as soon as possible, and flap grafting can effectively repair wound after early debridement. The function recovery of affected upper limb repaired with free flap grafting is better. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Burns, Electric#Child#Child, Preschool#Female#Humans#Infant#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Retrospective Studies#Skin Transplantation#Treatment Outcome#Upper Extremity#Wound Healing#Young Adult"
b'Objective: To investigate the expression of LC3B, p-AMPK\\xc3\\xa1 and p27 in cortical tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Methods: Nineteen specimens of surgically resected TSC cortical tubers were collected at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, from 2014 to 2017. The expression of the three proteins in the lesions and the adjacent relatively normal regions was detected by immunohistochemical staining (EnVision two-step method). Results: LC3B was mainly expressed in the dysmorphic neuron and giant cell in TSC cortical tubers and in the adjacent relatively normal neurons, and the expression was diffuse or perinuclear cytoplasmic. There was no significant difference in the average optical density between abnormal cells and neurons adjacent to the lesions (0.343\\xc2\\xb10.195 vs. 0.419\\xc2\\xb10.088, P>0.05). p-AMPK\\xc3\\xa1 was localized in the cytoplasm of dysmorphic neurons and giant cell in TSC cortical tubers. The average optical density of abnormal cells in the lesions was significantly higher than that of neurons adjacent to the lesions (0.306\\xc2\\xb10.123 vs. 0.233\\xc2\\xb10.654, P<0.05). P27 showed nuclear positivity, mainly expressed in the neurons and glial cells close to TSC cortical tubers, while the positive rate in the abnormal cells in TSC cortical tubers was low (15/19 vs. 7/19, P<0.05). Conclusion: There is no significant decrease in the level of autophagy in dysmorphic neurons and giant cells in TSC cortical tubers, which may be related to the compensatory mechanism of AMPK signaling pathway, but without activation of downstream p27. labels: #Autophagy-Related Proteins#Cerebral Cortex#Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27#Humans#Microtubule-Associated Proteins#Neuroglia#Neurons#Protein Kinases#Tuberous Sclerosis'
b'Objective: This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of adult rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients. Methods: The clinical data of 34 adult RMS patients were retrospectively analyzed. Based on their intervention and treatment, patients were divided into operation group (n=7), chemotherapy group (n=8) and operation plus chemotherapy group (n=19). The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of the three groups were compared. Results: A statically significant difference was found in IRSG surgical-pathological stage among the three groups (P=0.026), while no significant difference existed in gender, age of disease onset, primary site, tumor size, pathological subtypes and IRSG risk group in the three groups (all P>0.05). In the operation group, three CR, one PR, one SD and two PD were achieved and one CR, one PR, one SD and five PD were obtained in the chemotherapy group. While in the chemotherapy plus operation group, four CR, twelve PR, one SD and two PD were achieved. A significant difference was found in response (P=0.043) and median overall survival (OS) (P=0.036) among the three groups, which were 44.7, 26.9 and 53.6 months, respectively. Conclusions: Pleomorphic RMS was the main histological subtype for adult RMS patients, and the prognosis for adult RMS was usually poorer than that for pediatric RMS patients. Single therapeutic approach could not achieve satisfactory outcomes, while multimodal treatment consisted of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are helpful to improve the prognosis of adult patients with RMS. labels: #Adult#Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Combined Modality Therapy#Humans#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Rhabdomyosarcoma#Treatment Outcome'
b'Microalgae may be exploited in water or wastewater treatment facilities to reduce excess concentrations of nutrients and metals to comply with regulatory limits. In this study, we characterized the growth and phosphorus (P) removal capacity of an isolated strain of Tetradesmus obliquus VRUC280. Investigations were carried out from laboratory scale (50\\xe2\\x80\\xafmL) up to a 100\\xe2\\x80\\xafL outdoor photobioreactor (PBR). After 10 days, batch cultures removed up to 74% of the media P, while in the PBR, 95% removal was achieved within five days. The harvested biomass was then inactivated (freeze-dried) and used for metal adsorption tests, employing solutions containing 6.0\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg Cu L-1 or 4.8\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg Ni L-1. Metal removal rates were evaluated after 15, 30, 60 and 120\\xe2\\x80\\xafmin by the analysis of liquid and biomass metal contents. For the latter, a specific biomass digestion method was developed. Cu removal ranged between 50% and 65%, while for Ni, removal varied between 30% and 50%. 300-400\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg Cu Kg DW-1 and 130-250\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg Ni Kg DW-1 were rapidly adsorbed on the cell surface of T. obliquus (ca. 15-30\\xe2\\x80\\xafmin incubations).

b'TiO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 nanoparticles (NPs), which are mainly used in consumer products (mostly cosmetics), have been found to cause ecotoxic effects in the aquatic environment. The green algae Raphidocelis subcapitata, as a representative of primary producers of the freshwater ecosystem, has been frequently used to study the effects of metal oxide NPs. An ecotoxicity study was conducted herein to investigate the effects of TiO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 NPs on survival and membrane deformation of algal cells. Five different concentrations of nano-TiO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 particles (1, 10, 50, 100 and 500 mg/L) were prepared in synthetic surface water samples with five different water quality characteristics (pH 6.4-8.4, hardness 10-320 mg CaCO\\xe2\\x82\\x83/L, ionic strength 0.2-8 mM, and alkalinity 10-245 mg CaCO\\xe2\\x82\\x83/L). Results showed a significant increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs with respect to both NP concentrations and ionic content of the test system. A soft synthetic freshwater system at pH 7.3 \\xc2\\xb1 0.2 appeared to provide the most effective water type, with more than 95% algal mortality observed at 50, 100 and 500 mg/L NP concentrations. At high exposure concentrations, increased malondialdehyde formations were observed. Moreover, due to membrane deformation, TEM images correlated the uptake of the NPs. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To investigate the application value of motor unit number index (MUNIX) for diagnosis and assessment progress in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Method: Sixty healthy controls and 60 ALS patients in the clinic were enrolled from May 2017 to December 2018. The bilateral deltoid, abductor digiti minimi, quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior muscles of the subjects were detected by MUNIX method, and the negative peak amplitude of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of ulnar nerve, femoral nerve, peroneal nerve, axillary nerve in bilateral was collected. MUNIX and motor unit size index (MUSIX) of muscles were compared between ALS group and control group. The difference between the MUNIX abnormal rate of muscles and abnormal rate of the corresponding CMAP negative peak amplitude in ALS patients was further compared. Meanwhile, the correlation between the disease course of ALS patients and MUNIX and MUSIX was analyzed. Results: Compared with the control group, the MUNIX values of the deltoid, abductor digiti minimi, quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior decreased significantly (97\\xc2\\xb124 vs 183\\xc2\\xb138, 48\\xc2\\xb117 vs 191\\xc2\\xb139, 54\\xc2\\xb115 vs 159\\xc2\\xb122, 49\\xc2\\xb116 vs 147\\xc2\\xb125, all P<0.05). MUSIX values increased ((175\\xc2\\xb132) \\xc3\\xacV vs (47\\xc2\\xb115) \\xc3\\xacV, (189\\xc2\\xb134) \\xc3\\xacV vs (54\\xc2\\xb116) \\xc3\\xacV, (170\\xc2\\xb130) \\xc3\\xacV vs (49\\xc2\\xb113) \\xc3\\xacV, (190\\xc2\\xb1 36) \\xc3\\xacV vs (48\\xc2\\xb1 14) \\xc3\\xacV, all P<0.05)). In ALS patients, the abnormal rate of MUNIX was respectively 81%, 87%, 75% and 89%. The negative peak amplitude abnormal rate of corresponding neuralCMAP was 35%, 40%, 31% and 36%, respectively, with a significant difference (P<0.05). There was a negative correlation between MUNIX value and the course of disease in ALS patients (P<0.05), and a positive correlation between MUSIX value and the course of disease (P<0.05). Conclusion: The MUNIX technique exhibits the features of quantifying the proximal upper and lower limb muscles and assessing the loss of motor units in motor neuron degeneration. labels: #Action Potentials#Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis#Electromyography#Humans#Motor Neurons#Muscle, Skeletal#Peroneal Nerve'
b'CME: Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis Abstract. While tuberculosis mostly manifests as pulmonary infection, a dissemination in any extrapulmonary organ is possible. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mostly affects lymph nodes, pleura and bones. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as an HIV co-infection or immunosuppressive therapies like TNF-alpha-inhibitors have a higher risk of a dissemination of tuberculosis. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is difficult, as microbiological testing mostly requires invasive procedures to obtain a sample for direct proof of tuberculosis by microscopy, culture, molecular methods (e.g. Xpert\\xc2\\xae MTB/RIF) or histology. Treatment follows guidelines of pulmonary tuberculosis with a two-month regimen consisting of four drugs (rifampicin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide and ethambuthol), followed by a four-month therapy with two drugs (rifampicin and isoniazide). Duration of therapy is extended in tuberculous meningitis to one year and in a skeletal dissemination up to six to nine months. Corticosteroids are recommended in cerebral and pericardial tuberculosis. labels: #Antibiotics, Antitubercular#Humans#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Rifampin#Sensitivity and Specificity#Tuberculosis'
b'The unicellular marine alga Dunaliella salina is a most interesting green cell factory for the production of carotenes and lipids under extreme environment conditions. However, the culture conditions and their productivity are the major challenges faced by researchers which still need to be addressed. In this study, we investigated the effect of bicarbonate amendment on biomass, photosynthetic activity, biochemical constituents, nutrient uptake and antioxidant response of D. salina during macronutrient deficit conditions (N-, P- and S-). Under nutrient deficit conditions, addition of sodium bicarbonate (100\\xe2\\x80\\x89mM) significantly increased the biomass, carotenoids including \\xc3\\xa2-carotene and lutein, lipid, and fatty acid content with concurrent enhancement of the activities of nutrient assimilatory and carbonic anhydrase enzymes. Maximum accumulation of carotenoid especially \\xc3\\xa2-carotene (192.8\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x892.11\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb5g/100\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg) and lipids (53.9%) was observed on addition of bicarbonate during nitrate deficiency compared to phosphate and sulphate deficiency. Supplementation of bicarbonate reduced the oxidative stress caused by ROS, lowered lipid peroxidation damage and improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and APX) in D. salina cultures under nutrient stress. labels: #Chlorophyceae'

b'Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods: The clinicopathological data of patients of renal cell carcinoma arising in end-stage renal disease were collected from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (ten cases) and 971 Hospital of PLA Navy (five cases) from January 2009 to August 2018. Results: Among 15 patients, 14 were male and 1 was female, and the age ranged from 38 to 78 years (mean 51 years, median 49 years). All patients had history of chronic renal failure (7-192 months), including 9 patients treated with hemodialysis for 6 to 132 months. In 12 cases the tumor border was distinct and the tumor size ranged from 1.8 to 11.0 cm. Two cases were multifocal and one case showed extensive renal hemorrhage with an inconspicuous tumor mass. Microscopically, 9 cases were clear cell reanl cell carcinoma including one with sarcomatoid differentiation, 4 were acquired cystic kidney disease-associated(ACKD-RCC) and two were papillary renal cell carcinoma. All patients had a follow-up of 3 to 120 months. Four patients died during a follow-up of 6 to 60 months (mean 30 months) as a result of extensive distant metastases (two cases) and renal failure (two cases), while other eleven patients were alive without tumor recurrence or metastasis (median 40.8 months of follow-up ranging from 3 to 120 months). Conclusions: ESRD-RCC is more often seen in younger male patients. The time intervals from the onset of chronic renal failure to the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma differ and tumors are frequently incidental findings. The histological types can be sporadic renal cell carcinoma or unique ACKD-RCC. Tumors are often hemorrhagic and necrotic. Routine physical examination and early detection could benefit ESRD-RCC patients. ESRD-RCC may have a favorable prognosis despite of a large tumor size or the presence of sarcomatoid differentiation. labels: #Adult#Aged#Carcinoma, Renal Cell#Female#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Kidney Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasm Recurrence, Local#Nephrectomy#Prognosis'
b'Retinoids are essential during early cardiovascular morphogenesis. However, recent studies showed their important role in cardiac remodeling in rats with hypertension and following myocardial infarction. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of zeaxanthin heneicosylate (ZH); a carotenoid ester isolated from Dunaliella salina microalgae, on cardiac dysfunction ensuing d-galactose injection in rats. Rats injected with d-GAL (200 mg/kg; I.P) for 8 weeks were orally treated with ZH (250 \\xc3\\xacg/kg) for 28 consecutive days. Results showed that d-GAL injection caused dramatic electrocardiographic changes as well as marked elevation in serum levels of homocysteine, creatinine kinase isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase. A reduction in the cardiac contents of glucose transporter-4 and superoxide dismutase along with the elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthetase and interleukin-6 was also noticed. Oral administration of ZH significantly improved the above mentioned cardiac aging manifestations; this was further emphasized through histopathological examinations. The effect of ZH is mediated through the interaction with retinoid receptor alpha (RAR-\\xc3\\xa1) as evidenced through a significant elevation of RAR-\\xc3\\xa1 expression in cardiac tissue following the lead of an in silico molecular docking study. In conclusion, zeaxanthin heneicosylate isolated from D. salina ameliorated age-associated cardiac dysfunction in rats through the activation of retinoid receptors. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and psychological predictors of OHRQoL.METHODS: Cross-sectional clinical and questionnaire study with 332 adolescents aged 11-14 years. The facial profile was classified through photographs and dental malocclusion was classified by the Dental Health Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. The psychosocial variables were assessed by the Aesthetic Component of IOTN, the Orthodontic Aesthetic Subjective Impact Score and the Global Negative Self-Evaluation. OHRQoL was measured using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression models.RESULTS: Higher aesthetic concern and low self-esteem were 3.43 and 3.34 times more likely to affect OHRQoL (p?0.05), respectively. The facial and dental aspects of malocclusion were unrelated to OHRQoL.CONCLUSIONS: Facial and dental aspects of malocclusion were unrelated to OHRQoL, whereas psychosocial variables such as self-perception of orthodontic treatment need and self-esteem predicted adolescents' oral health related quality of life. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Cross-Sectional Studies#Humans#Malocclusion#Oral Health#Quality of Life#Self Concept#Surveys and Questionnaires"
b'In this study, the effects of strigolactone (SL) on the biomass, lipid content, biochemical properties, and gene transcription of Monoraphidium sp. QLY-1 were examined. The lipid content and lipid productivity increased by 61% and 55% in QLY-1 under 1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc3\\xacM SL induction compared to the control group, respectively. SL also upregulated the levels of endogenous NO and Ca2+ and lipid biosynthesis gene transcription. Subsequently, the relationship between Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of cell growth and lipid accumulation of QLY-1 under SL induction conditions was analysed. An increase in endogenous Ca2+ regulated cell growth and lipid biosynthesis by modulating the levels of NO and lipid biosynthesis-related gene expression. Collectively, this study provided a valuable approach for biofuel production from microalgae under SL induction and demonstrated that there is crucial crosstalk between the Ca2+ and NO signalling in the manipulation of lipid biosynthesis in microalgae under SL treatment. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"If the abdominal pedicled flaps are not well fixed after repair of deep electric burn wounds in hands, many problems such as poor blood supply may occur. In order to solve the above problems, we designed and manufactured the individualized low temperature thermoplastic plate combined with special abdominal band to fix abdominal pedicled flaps for repairing of 17 patients (12 males and 5 females, aged 2-35 years) with deep electric burn wounds in hands from February 2016 to August 2018, and achieved the desired results. The shoulder joint, elbow joint, and wrist joint were fixed by low temperature thermoplastic plate according to the 1/2 circumference of the patient's side chest and upper arm, and the braking of wrist joint and elbow joint was strengthened by special abdominal band. Application of the combined method of fixing abdominal pedicled flaps in repairing deep electric burn wounds in hands has high success rate of flap transplantation. It is simple to make and practical, and worthy of clinical promotion. labels: #Abdomen#Adolescent#Adult#Burns, Electric#Child#Child, Preschool#Cold Temperature#Female#Hand Injuries#Humans#Male#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Surgical Flaps#Wound Healing#Young Adult"
b'The biodiversity of terrestrial algae is still grossly understudied, and African deserts in particular are barely touched in this respect. Here, four coccoid green algae from oases in the Western Desert of Egypt were characterized using a combination of morphotaxonomic, ecological and 18S rDNA data, with additional carotenoid and lipid analyses for two of the strains. Three strains were identified as affiliated with known taxa: Mychonastes sp., Asterarcys sp. (first report of this genus from a desert soil), and Stichococcus cf. deasonii. The fourth strain is proposed to represent a new cryptic genus Pharao gen. nov., with the type species P.\\xc2\\xa0desertorum sp. nov. The new taxon is sister to the clade of uncharacterized North American desert strains of Radiococcaceae (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta). The pigment profile of P.\\xc2\\xa0desertorum gen. et sp. nov. revealed carotenoids and chlorophylls typical of green algae. Bioorganic analysis showed a complex lipidome based on phospho- (PC), galacto- (MGDG and DGDG), betaine- (DGTS), and sulfoquinovosyl- (SQDG) membrane lipids, besides significant amounts of storage neutral lipids such as diacyl- (DAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG). The presence of saturated alkyl chains within all the membrane lipid classes in P.\\xc2\\xa0desertorum and Asterarcys sp. appears to reflect the need to maintain membrane fluidity and viscosity. In summary, African deserts likely still harbor new taxa to be described, and lipidomic analyses of such taxa may provide clues about their ability to survive in the extremely harsh desert habitats. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Sphaeropleales are a dominant group of green algae, which contain species important to freshwater ecosystems and those that have potential applied usages. In particular, Raphidocelis subcapitata is widely used worldwide for bioassays in toxicological risk assessments. However, there are few comparative genome analyses of the Sphaeropleales. To reveal genome evolution in the Sphaeropleales based on well-resolved phylogenetic relationships, nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid genomes were sequenced in this study. The plastid genome provides insights into the phylogenetic relationships of R. subcapitata, which is located in the most basal lineage of the four species in the family Selenastraceae. The mitochondrial genome shows dynamic evolutionary histories with intron expansion in the Selenastraceae. The 51.2 Mbp nuclear genome of R. subcapitata, encoding 13,383 protein-coding genes, is more compact than the genome of its closely related oil-rich species, Monoraphidium neglectum (Selenastraceae), Tetradesmus obliquus (Scenedesmaceae), and Chromochloris zofingiensis (Chromochloridaceae); however, the four species share most of their genes. The Sphaeropleales possess a large number of genes for glycerolipid metabolism and sugar assimilation, which suggests that this order is capable of both heterotrophic and mixotrophic lifestyles in nature. Comparison of transporter genes suggests that the Sphaeropleales can adapt to different natural environmental conditions, such as salinity and low metal concentrations. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: To understand the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of chronic critical illness (CCI) in China. Methods: The clinical data of 472 adult patients admitted to ICU in 53 hospitals, including basic information, disease-related data, nutrition program, etc., were collected on May 10, 2019, by means of multi-center cross-sectional study. If surgical intervention was needed or the occurrence of the disease was directly related to the surgery, ICU patients were regarded as surgical ICU cases (n=211). In this study, the diagnostic criteria for CCI were: (1) admission to ICU >14 days;(2) combined with persistent organ dysfunction. The prevalence,distribution and treatment of CCI and surgery-related CCI were recorded and analyzed. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fisher exact test were used for comparative analysis. Results: Among the 472 ICU patients from 53 hospitals, 326 were male (69.1%) and 146 were female (30.9%). The prevalence of CCI was 30.7% (145/472). Among 211 surgery-related ICU patients, 57 developed CCI with a prevalence of 27.0%. As compared to non-CCI patients, higher APACHE II score [median (IQR) 13.5 (10.0, 18.3) vs. 11.0 (7.0, 16.0), U=2970.000, P=0.007], higher Charlson comorbidity index [median (IQR) 4.0 (2.0, 7.0) vs. 3.0 (1.0, 5.0), U= 3570.000, P=0.036] and higher ratio of breath dysfunction [68.4% (39/57) vs. 48.1% (74/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=6.939, P=0.008] and renal dysfunction [42.1% (24/57) vs. 18.2% (28/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=12.821, P<0.001] were found in surgery-related CCI patients. While SOFA score, Glasgow coma score and other visceral function were not significantly different between surgery-related CCI and non-CCI patients (all P>0.05). NUTRIC score showed that surgery-related CCI patients had higher nutritional risk [43.9% (25/57) vs. 26.6%(41/154), U=5.750, P=0.016] and higher ratio of mechanical ventilation [66.7% (38/57) vs. 52.3% (79/154), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.977, P=0.046] than non-CCI patients. On the survey day, the daily caloric requirements of 50.2% (106/211) of surgery-related ICU patients were calculated according to the standard adult caloric intake index (104.6 to 125.5 kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), 1 kJ=0.239 kcal), and the daily caloric requirements of 46.4% (98/211) of patients were calculated by physicians according to the severity of the patient's condition. 60.2% (127/211) of nutritional support therapy was enteral nutrition (including a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition), while the remaining patients received parenteral nutrition (24.6%, 52/211), simple glucose infusion (9.0%, 19/211), or oral diet (6.2%, 13/211). The target calorie of CCI group was 104.6 (87.9, 125.5) kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), and the actual calorie intake accounted for 0.98 (0.80, 1.00) of the target calory. In the non-CCI group, the target calorie was 104.6 (87.9, 125.5) kJ\\xc2\\xb7kg(-1)\\xc2\\xb7d(-1), and the actual calorie consumed accounted for 0.91 (0.66, 1.00) of the target calorie. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups (P=0.248, P=0.150). Conclusion: The prevalence of CCI and surgery-related CCI in ICU is high, along with severe complications, respiratory and renal dysfunction and mechanical ventilation. Surgical patients admitted to ICU are at high nutritional risk, and active and correct nutritional support is essential for such patients. labels: #Adult#China#Chronic Disease#Critical Illness#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intensive Care Units#Male#Nutritional Support#Surgical Procedures, Operative"
b'Astaxanthin (ASX) is a xanthophyll family of hydroxycarotenoids which contains several double bonds. It is produced by Haemococcus pluvialis, a microalgae and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to test whether ASX could protect against oxidative damage in the testicular tissues of rats receiving high fructose. The rats (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa024) were randomly divided into two main groups: control and fructose (30%, via drinking water) and then each main group either not supplemented or supplemented with ASX (1\\xc2\\xa0mg kg-1 day-1 , within 0.2\\xc2\\xa0ml olive oil) via oral gavage. Data were subjected to two-way ANOVA. High fructose consumption tended to increase testis weight and serum testosterone concentration and decreased testicular tissue glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, but did not affect testicular tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Astaxanthin administration increased testosterone, GST and SOD levels and testis weight and decreased MDA concentration. However, ASX administration did not reverse alterations in antioxidant parameters caused by high fructose consumption. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) tended to increase in sertoli cell, spermatid and spermatogonia, but not in spermatocytes and leydig cell in response to high fructose consumption. Astaxanthin administration tended to reverse elevation in iNOS in testis cells. In conclusion, ASX could help alleviate oxidative damage caused by high fructose consumption. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVES: Access to dental healthcare services is a major determinant of dental health in communities. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the global prevalence of dental needs and of unmet dental needs in adolescents.METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched in June 2018. The summary measures included the prevalence of met and unmet dental needs. A meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method to obtain pooled summary measures. Out of 41,661 retrieved articles, 57 were ultimately included.RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of orthodontic treatment needs was 46.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 53.0), that of general treatment needs was 59.0% (95% CI, 42.0 to 75.0), that of periodontal treatment needs was 71.0% (95% CI, 46.0 to 96.0), and that of malocclusion treatment needs was 39.0% (95% CI, 28.0 to 50.0). The pooled prevalence of unmet dental needs was 34.0% (95% CI, 27.0 to 40.0).CONCLUSIONS: The highest and lowest prevalence of unmet dental needs were found in Southeast Asia and Europe, respectively. The prevalence of dental needs was higher in the countries of the Americas and Europe than in other World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The prevalence of unmet dental needs was higher in Southeast Asia and Africa than in other WHO regions. labels: #Adolescent#Dental Care#Global Health#Health Services Needs and Demand#Humans#Prevalence'
b'We evaluated overall survivals (OSs) of alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without LC compared to those with LC.Between 2005 and 2015, 1343 patients were initially diagnosed as having HCC in our hospital. Of these, 186 alcohol-related HCC patients were enrolled in this study, and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. Significant alcohol intake was defined as more than 210\\xe2\\x80\\x8agrams/week for men and more than 140\\xe2\\x80\\x8agrams/week for women.Non-cirrhotic HCC was observed in 37.1% of the 186 patients. Cumulative OS rates were significantly higher in non-cirrhotic patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006). For the 117 cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class B (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001) or CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001) patients, respectively. In the 69 non-cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class C patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), but, not than in the CTP class B patients (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.157). Multivariate analyses revealed that CTP class B (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), and tumor size (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.006) were significant predictors for OS in cirrhotic patients, and that CTP class C (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002) and tumor size (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.023) were significant predictors for OS in non-cirrhotic patients.OS was found to be better for non-cirrhotic than cirrhotic patients with alcohol-related HCC. Survivals of alcohol-related HCC patients without cirrhosis were comparable between patients with CTP class A and B. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Hepatocellular#Female#Humans#Liver Cirrhosis#Liver Diseases, Alcoholic#Liver Neoplasms#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors'
b'Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms widely used for the production of highly valued compounds, and recently they have been shown to be promising as a system for the heterologous expression of proteins. Several transformation methods have been successfully developed, from which the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method remains the most promising. However, microalgae transformation efficiency by A. tumefaciens is shown to vary depending on several transformation conditions. The present study aimed to establish an efficient genetic transformation system in the green microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta using the A. tumefaciens method. The parameters assessed were the infection medium, the concentration of the A. tumefaciens and co-culture time. As a preliminary screening, the expression of the gusA gene and the viability of transformed cells were evaluated and used to calculate a novel parameter called Transformation Efficiency Index (TEI). The statistical analysis of TEI values showed five treatments with the highest gusA gene expression. To ensure stable transformation, transformed colonies were cultured on selective medium using hygromycin B and the DNA of resistant colonies were extracted after five subcultures and molecularly analyzed by PCR. Results revealed that treatments which use solid infection medium, A. tumefaciens OD600\\xe2\\x80\\xaf=\\xe2\\x80\\xaf0.5 and co-culture times of 72\\xe2\\x80\\xafh exhibited the highest percentage of stable gusA expression. Overall, this study established an efficient, optimized A. tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of D. tertiolecta, which represents a relatively easy procedure with no expensive equipment required. This simple and efficient protocol opens the possibility for further genetic manipulation of this commercially-important microalgae for biotechnological applications. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Stress-induced injury is a common complication associated with patients with chronic critical illness (CCI). Skin-stretching device (SSD) and vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) technique are 2 approaches that can facilitate wound healing.In the present study, the effect of the concatenated application of the 2 techniques on the phases III and IV stress-induced injuries in aged patients with CCI was assessed. About 70 patients with CCI with stress-induced injuries were selected from February 2015 to October 2017. The treatment outcomes of the combined method and VSD method were assessed by comparing their clinicopathologic parameters.The results showed that the combined treatment shortened the average healing duration of wounds. Moreover, the total area of pressure sores, incidence of bleeding, bacteria amount, 28-day cure rate, peripheral C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and the hospitalization duration were all significantly improved in patients treated with SSD and VSD. The overall effective rate (97.14%) of patients treated with VSD and SSD was significantly higher than that (77.14%) in patients treated with VSD.The present study showed that the combined application of VSD and SSD improved the treatment outcomes of phases III and IV stress-induced injuries in aged patients with CCI. labels: #Age Factors#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Chronic Disease#Critical Illness#Female#Humans#Male#Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy#Pressure Ulcer#Retrospective Studies#Severity of Illness Index#Stress, Mechanical#Treatment Outcome'
b'RATIONALE: Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to long-term viral suppression, reduces proviral reservoir size, and prolongs time to rebound. Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lifelong disease, diagnostic monitoring after confirmed infection is typically not performed; therefore, little is known about the impact of early initiation and long-term ART on the sensitivity of assays that detect HIV antibodies and viral nucleic acid in children and adolescents.PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report 1 case of diagnosed and confirmed perinatal HIV-1C infection with longstanding viral suppression, who subsequently had a negative HIV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test, undetectable antibodies to HIV-1, and high CD4+ T cell count after 14 years of ART.DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with HIV in 2002 at 1 and 2 months of age using DNA polymerase chain reaction. At 8 months old, his viral load was 1210 HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/mL and CD4 T cell count was 3768\\xe2\\x80\\x8acells/mm.INTERVENTION: At the age of 9 months, highly active antiretroviral therapy comprising of zidovudine, nevirapine, and lamivudine was initiated. The patient remained on this treatment for 14 years 11 months and was virally suppressed.OUTCOMES: At the age of 14 years 4 months, the participant decided to visit a local voluntary HIV testing center, where a rapid HIV test came out negative and the viral load was undetectable (<400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). These results led to termination of ART which led to viral rebound within 9 months.LESSONS: As more people with early HIV infection initiate early ART in the context of "Test and Treat all" recommendations, aspects of this report may become more commonplace, with both clinical and public health implications. If the possibility of functional cure (or false-positive diagnosis) is being considered, decisions to terminate ART should be made cautiously and with expert guidance, and may benefit from highly sensitive quantification of the proviral reservoir. labels: #Adolescent#Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active#DNA, Viral#Follow-Up Studies#HIV Infections#HIV-1#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Male#Proviruses#Time Factors#Virus Activation#Withholding Treatment'
b'Anthropogenic inputs of chemical environmental contaminants are frequently associated with developing harmful algal blooms, but little is known about how estuarine phytoplankton assemblages respond to multiple, co-occurring chemical stressors in chronically disturbed habitats. The goals of this research were to establish a robust protocol for testing the effects of atrazine on estuarine phytoplankton, and then to use that protocol to compare the effects of atrazine exposure with and without nutrient enrichment on a cosmopolitan estuarine/marine alga, Dunaliella tertiolecta (Chlorophyta). Atrazine sensitivity in nutrient-replete media (96-h growth inhibition [Formula: see text]) was 159.16\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\xacg\\xc2\\xa0l-1, but sensitivity was influenced by exposure duration, and inhibitory effects of herbicide on algal growth decreased under imbalanced nutrient regimes and low nitrogen and phosphorus supplies. These findings advance knowledge about how nutrient regimes and herbicides interact to control estuarine phytoplankton population dynamics. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"During the last decade, China's agro-food production has increased rapidly and been accompanied by the challenge of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental pollutants from fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive energy use. Understanding the energy use and environmental impacts of crop production will help identify environmentally damaging hotspots of agro-production, allowing environmental impacts to be assessed and crop management strategies optimized. Conventional farming has been widely employed in wolfberry (Lycium barbarum) cultivation in China, which is an important cash tree crop not only for the rural economy but also from an ecological standpoint. Energy use and global warming potential (GWP) were investigated in a wolfberry production system in the Yellow River irrigated Jingtai region of Gansu. In total, 52 household farms were randomly selected to conduct the investigation using questionnaires. Total energy input and output were 321,800.73 and 166,888.80\\xe2\\x80\\x89MJ\\xe2\\x80\\x89ha-1, respectively, in the production system. The highest share of energy inputs was found to be electricity consumption for lifting irrigation water, accounting for 68.52%, followed by chemical fertilizer application (11.37%). Energy use efficiency was 0.52 when considering both fruit and pruned wood. Nonrenewable energy use (88.52%) was far larger than the renewable energy input. The share of GWP of different inputs were 64.52% electricity, 27.72% nitrogen (N) fertilizer, 5.07% phosphate, 2.32% diesel, and 0.37% potassium, respectively. The highest share was related to electricity consumption for irrigation, followed by N fertilizer use. Total GWP in the wolfberry planting system was 26,018.64\\xe2\\x80\\x89kg CO2 eq ha-1 and the share of CO2, N2O, and CH4 were 99.47%, 0.48%, and negligible respectively with CO2 being dominant. Pathways for reducing energy use and GHG emission mitigation include: conversion to low carbon farming to establish a sustainable and cleaner production system with options of raising water use efficiency by adopting a seasonal gradient water pricing system and advanced irrigation techniques; reducing synthetic fertilizer use; and policy support: smallholder farmland transfer (concentration) for scale production, credit (small- and low-interest credit) and tax breaks. labels: #Agriculture#Carbon#China#Fertilizers#Global Warming#Greenhouse Effect#Lycium#Methane#Nitrous Oxide"
b'Objective: To investigate the effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) knockdown on proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and explore the mechanism. Methods: The expression levels of HO-1 mRNA in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H358 and H1993) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression level of HO-1 in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens. The HO-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was transfected into A549 cells by RNA interference technique. HO-1 stably deleted A549 cells were selected (HO-1 shRNA group) and verified by RT-qPCR and western blot. HO-1 shRNA A549 cells and control shRNA A549 cells were treated with the inducer of autophagy Torin1 or its inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), respectively. The expressions of autophagic markers LC3B and p62 were determined by western blot. The proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of each group of A549 cells were assessed by cell counting, Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. Results: The expressions of HO-1 mRNA in lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H358 and H1993) were significantly higher than that of HBECs, and HO-1 upregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of p62 protein and the ratio of LC3B-?/ LC3B-? in no treatment group, Torin1 treatment group and Baf A1 treatment group were significantly higher than those of the corresponding control group (P<0.05). After 11 days of culture, the number of cells in HO-1 shRNA group were 41.8%, 30.4% and 14.0% of the corresponding control group, respectively. The number of lower chamber cells in HO-1 shRNA group were (35.7\\xc2\\xb12.1), (27.0\\xc2\\xb11.0) and (38.0\\xc2\\xb11.0)/field, respectively, which were lower than (66.0\\xc2\\xb19.2), (39.3\\xc2\\xb11.2) and (43.0\\xc2\\xb12.6)/field of the corresponding control group, respectively (P<0.05). The migration distances of HO-1 shRNA group were (7.47\\xc2\\xb10.91) mm, (4.23\\xc2\\xb10.82) mm and (5.42\\xc2\\xb10.24) mm, which were lower than (10.07\\xc2\\xb11.26) mm, (7.14\\xc2\\xb10.07) mm and (12.04\\xc2\\xb10.80) mm of the corresponding control groups, respectively (P<0.05).

b'Objective: To assess the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of multiple pregnancies. Methods: In this retrospective study, 84 cases (total 174 fetuses) of complex monochorionic pregnancies treated with RFA for selective fetal reduction were analyzed. All cases were managed in the Guangdong Women and Children Hospital from January 2015 to January 2018. Indications for offering RFA, details of the procedure and pregnancy outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: (1)The rate of miscarriage and fetal intrauterine death was 21% (18/84), termination of pregnancy because of fetal malformation or oligohydramnion occurred in 10% (8/84) of cases. Total live birth rate was 69% (58/84) and the gestation age at delivery was (35.0\\xc2\\xb13.0) weeks. (2) The live birth rate of twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (TRAPS) was the lowest (6/11), followed by twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS; 66%, 27/41), structural or genetic abnormalities of one fetus in monochorionic twin pregnancy (10/14), triplet pregnancy reduction (4/6) and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) (11/12). (3) The live birth rate was 67% (20/30) in stage ? of TTTS and 7/11 in the stage ? of TTTS (P>0.05). The average gestational age was (33.6\\xc2\\xb13.0) weeks in stage ? of TTTS compared with (36.5\\xc2\\xb12.4) weeks in the stage ?of TTTS (P<0.05). Conclusions: RFA appears to be a reliable option for selective fetal reduction in monochorionic multiple pregnancies. The indication of RFA is an influencing factor on its pregnancy outcomes. Type ?and type ? sIUGR may choose this technique as a priority. Compared with stage ? of TTTS, the live birth rate and the gestation age at delivery in stage ? of TTTS, there are no significant differences. labels: #Child#China#Female#Fetofetal Transfusion#Gestational Age#Humans#Live Birth#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Outcome#Pregnancy Reduction, Multifetal#Pregnancy, Twin#Prognosis#Radiofrequency Ablation#Retrospective Studies#Twins, Monozygotic'
b'The Carpathian Basin is a lowland plain located mainly in Hungary. Due to the nature of the bedrock, alluvial deposits, and a bowl shape, many lakes and ponds of the area are characterized by high alkalinity. In this study, we characterized temporal changes in eukaryal and bacterial community dynamics with high throughput sequencing and relate the changes to environmental conditions in Lake Velence located in Fej?r county, Hungary. The sampled Lake Velence microbial populations (algal and bacterial) were analyzed to identify potential correlations with other community members and environmental parameters at six timepoints over 6\\xc2\\xa0weeks in the Spring of 2012. Correlations between community members suggest a positive relationship between certain algal and bacterial populations (e.g. Chlamydomondaceae with Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria), while other correlations allude to changes in these relationships over time. During the study, high nitrogen availability may have favored non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, such as the toxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa, and the eutrophic effect may have been exacerbated by high phosphorus availability as well as the high calcium and magnesium content of the Carpathian Basin bedrock, potentially fostering exopolymer production and cell aggregation. Cyanobacterial bloom formation could have a negative environmental impact on other community members and potentially affect overall water quality as well as recreational activities. To our knowledge, this is the first prediction for relationships between photoautotrophic eukaryotes and bacteria from an alkaline, Hungarian lake. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Phycology has developed alongside light and electron microscopy techniques. Since the 1950s, progress in the field has accelerated dramatically with the advent of electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes can only acquire imaging data on a 2D plane. Currently, many of the life sciences are seeking to obtain 3D images with electron microscopy for the accurate interpretation of subcellular dynamics. Three-dimensional reconstruction using serial sections is a method that can cover relatively large cells or tissues without requiring special equipment. Another challenge is monitoring secondary metabolites (such as lipids or carotenoids) in intact cells. This became feasible with hyperspectral cameras, which enable the acquisition of wide-range spectral information in living cells. Here, we review bioimaging studies on the intracellular dynamics of substances such as lipids, carotenoids and phosphorus using conventional to state-of-the-art microscopy techniques in the field of algal biorefining. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are considered to be the main cause of spontaneous abortion (SA). We aimed to determine the differences in the rates and numbers of chromosomal abnormalities between samples from women with a history of one versus more than one SA as well as between samples from first- and second-trimester SAs in women from Northeast China.In total, 1210 products of conception (POCs) from patients with a history of one or more SAs were examined. Of these 1210 samples, 434 were from women with a history of 1 SA, and 776 were from women with a history of more than 1 SA. Additionally, 1071 samples were from the first trimester, 118 were from the second trimester, and 21 were from the third trimester. We identified chromosomal abnormalities by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Among the 1210 POCs in women with SA, 607 (50.17%) had fetal chromosomal abnormalities. There were no significant differences in the rates of chromosomal abnormalities according to the abortion frequency. However, first-trimester SA had a significantly higher percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities than second-trimester SA (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). Among 663 chromosomal abnormalities, 633 abnormalities occurred in first-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 16 (14.38%), followed by monosomy X (13.27%), trisomy 22 (7.90%), and trisomy 15 (5.37%). Thirty abnormalities occurred in second-trimester SA; the most frequent karyotype was trisomy 18 (26.67%), followed by monosomy X (16.67%), trisomy 21 (13.33%), and trisomy 13 (10.00%). No chromosomal abnormalities occurred in the third trimester.These findings indicate the importance of determining the genetic cause of abortion in patients with a history of SA. We also identified a trend suggesting that the percentage of fetal chromosomal abnormalities is significantly higher in first- than second-trimester SA. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in POCs from SA can be increased by NGS, which is beneficial for couples with recurrent miscarriages and offers better genetic counseling in the clinical setting. labels: #Abortion, Spontaneous#Chromosome Aberrations#DNA Copy Number Variations#Female#Fetus#High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing#Humans#Pregnancy'
b'Energy-saving, high-efficiency cell disruption is a critical step for recovery of thermolabile antioxidant astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis cyst cells of rigid cell-wall structure. In this study, as room-temperature green solvents, 10 types of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([Emim])-based ionic liquids (ILs) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to disrupt H. pluvialis cyst cells for astaxanthin/lipid extraction. Among the 10 ILs tested, 3 [Emim]-based ILs with HSO4, CH3SO3, and (CF3SO2)2N anions were selected based on astaxanthin/lipid extraction performance and synthesis cost. When pretreated with IL/water mixtures, intact cyst cells were significantly torn, broken or shown to release cytoplasmic components, thereby facilitating subsequent separation of astaxanthin/lipid by hexane. However, excess IL pretreatments at high temperature/IL dosages and longer incubation times significantly deteriorated lipid and/or astaxanthin. Under optimized mild conditions (6.7% (v/v) IL in water solution, 30\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb0C, 60\\xe2\\x80\\xafmin), almost complete astaxanthin recoveries (>99%) along with moderate lipid extractions (?82%) could be obtained. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective To explore the functions and mechanisms of macrophages derived from PGRN gene knockout (PGRN-/- ) C57BL/6 mice in the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Methods Breast cancer cells were cultured in conditioned medium of macrophages derived from WT and PGRN-/- mice. TranswellTM assay and scratch assay were used to detect the invasion and migration ability of cancer cells. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in cancer cells. Cytokine array, real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA were performed to investigate the differences of cytokines secreted by macrophages derived from WT and PGRN-/- mice. Breast cancer cells were treated by the differentially expressed cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and then the above methods were used to investigate its effect on cancer cells. Western blot analysis was used to verify the roles of NF-\\xc3\\xaaB and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. Results The macrophages derived from PGRN-/- mice blocked NF-\\xc3\\xaaB signaling pathway, reduced IL-6 secretion, and inhibited the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. IL-6 activated JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway to promote the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Conclusion The macrophages derived from PGRN-/- mice can block the NF-\\xc3\\xaaB and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways, down-regulate IL-6 expression, and inhibit the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. labels: #Animals#Breast Neoplasms#Cadherins#Cell Movement#Culture Media, Conditioned#Granulins#Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins#Interleukin-6#Macrophages#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Mice, Knockout#NF-kappa B#Neoplasm Invasiveness#STAT3 Transcription Factor#Signal Transduction#Tumor Cells, Cultured'
b'INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative seizures under general anesthesia are rare and our observation is the first to demonstrate a distinct electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern on the Narcotrend monitor.PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a 30-year-old man undergoing craniotomy for glioblastoma resection under general anesthesia who suffered tonic-clonic seizures captured in a specific pattern by the intraoperative EEG.DIAGNOSES: Our depth of anesthesia monitor recorded, before the seizure, a widening of the beta-wave performance in a distinct "triangular-shaped" pattern. This pattern was repeated before the second seizure. The patient had no previous history of seizures and following surgery no further seizures were recorded.INTERVENTIONS: A spectrogram analysis showed a distinct increase in mean absolute beta power immediately prior to the first seizure. The EEG immediately prior to the second seizure was characterized by broadband noise. Both seizures were characterized by increased mean absolute delta, theta, and beta power.OUTCOMES: The increase in EEG beta activity seen before the tonic-clonic movements may represent cortical irritability secondary to surgical manipulation, induced by electrical stimulation, reflecting progressive brain over-arousal. The attentive analysis of the relative beta power may have helped forecast the occurrence of the second seizure.LESSONS: We report the use of a simple, inexpensive, and portable EEG-based monitoring device to assist seizure detection and decision making. labels: #Adult#Anesthesia, General#Electroencephalography#Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic#Humans#Intraoperative Complications#Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring#Male'
b'The effects of the combined treatment of fulvic acid (FA) and salinity stress on lipid production in Monoraphidium sp. QLY-1 at multiple levels was investigated in this study. The results indicated that the highest lipid content (59.53%) in QLY-1 was achieved by combining FA treatment and salinity stress. Compared with the control group and FA addition alone, the group treated with both FA and salinity stress had increased contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidases, and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the addition of FA enhanced the expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and key genes related to lipid biosynthesis in QLY-1 under salinity stress. Collectively, biochemical analyses indicated that ROS, NO, MAPK, expression of lipid biosynthesis-related genes and antioxidant systems were involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathways of QLY-1 under the combined treatment of FA and salinity stress. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In the present study, to improve the photosynthetic betacarotene productivity of Dunaliella salina, a blue-red LED wavelength-shifting system (B-R system) was investigated. Dunaliella salina under the B-R system showed enhanced density and beta-carotene productivity compared to D. salina cultivated under single light-emitting diode light wavelengths (blue, white, and red light-emitting diode). Additionally, we developed blue light-adapted D. salina (ALE-D. salina) using an adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach. In combination with the B-R system applied to ALE-D. salina (ALE B-R system), the beta-carotene concentration (33.94 \\xc2\\xb1 0.52 \\xc3\\xacM) was enhanced by 19.7% compared to that observed for the non-ALE-treated wild-type of D. salina (intact D. salina) under the B-R system (28.34 \\xc2\\xb1 0.24 \\xc3\\xacM). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Species invasions are a major driver of ecological change, are very difficult to control or reverse, and will increase with climate change and global trade. Invasion sciences consider how species in invaded environments adapt, but neither scientists nor policy makers consider human adaptation to invasive species and how this affects ecosystems and well-being. To address this, a framework conceptualising autochthonous human adaptation to invasions was developed based on the Human Adaptation to Biodiversity Change framework and a case study metasynthesis. Results show that adaptation occurs within different spheres of human activity and organisation at different social-ecological scales; responses have feedbacks within and across these spheres. Adaptation to invasives and other drivers is a set of highly contextual, complex, non-linear responses that make up pathways pursued over time. Most invasive species management and adaptation occurs 'from below,' and policies and planned control efforts should support autochthonous adaptation, rather than undermining it. labels: #Biodiversity#Climate Change#Ecology#Ecosystem#Humans#Introduced Species"
b'The Nordic microalgal strain Haematococcus pluvialis was exposed to various stress conditions to induce astaxanthin accumulation. Highest carotenoid content (19.1\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xc2\\xb7g-1dw) was achieved in nitrogen-free culture medium at a high light intensity. The efficiency of Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) pre-treatment of stressed fresh biomass of H. pluvialis followed by incubation in the growth medium was compared to classical disruption methods (bead-beating, freezing-thawing, thermal treatment or ultrasound) for the subsequent extraction of astaxanthin in ethanol. N-starved cells treated with PEF followed by aqueous incubation for 6\\xe2\\x80\\xafh resulted in extraction of 96% (18.3 mgcar\\xc2\\xb7gdw-1) of the total carotenoid content compared to 80% (15.3 mgcar\\xc2\\xb7gdw-1) using other physical methods. The proportion of free forms of astaxanthin was higher in PEF-treated samples compared to mechanical disruption, suggesting PEF triggering an esterase activity. PEF pre-treatment of the cells followed by incubation in growth medium improved astaxanthin extraction in the eco-friendly solvent ethanol. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the practical use of three prognostic predication models in clinical non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 1 202 clinical non-metastatic RCC patients operated on between 1999 and 2012 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Survival analysis method was used to establish three prognostic prediction models including SSIGN, Leibovich and UISS based on different clinical and pathological indicators. The predictive ability was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS: Of the 1 202 clinical non-metastatic RCC patients, 1 030 cases were limited RCC patients, and 172 cases were locally advanced RCC patients. The median follow-up time of the patients was 63.02 months. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rate were 94.7% and 87.6%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with different clinical stages and grades were significantly different. The predictive accuracies for limited RCC of UISS, SSIGN and Leibovich model were 0.667, 0.785 and 0.758, respectively. For locally advanced RCC, the predictive accuracies of the three models were all lower than 0.6.CONCLUSIONS: SSIGN has certain predictive value in clinical non-metastatic RCC. However, for the advanced RCC, all the prognostic models demonstrate limited predictive value. labels: #Carcinoma, Renal Cell#China#Humans#Kidney Neoplasms#Predictive Value of Tests#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Survival Rate'
b'OBJECTIVE: To establish a congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD)-associated SLC26A3 c.392C>G (p.P131R) polymorphism-expressing cell model, and to investigate its biological function.METHODS: The sequence of the SLC26A3 gene in GenBank was used to design the upstream and downstream single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that could specifically recognize the 392 locus of the SLC26A3 gene, and the sgRNA was mixed with the pSpCas9-puro vector after enzyme digestion to construct an eukaryotic recombinant expression plasmid (pSpCas9-SLC26A3). Caco-2 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid and synthesized single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs), and Taqman genotyping assay and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the expression of SLC26A3 c.392C>G (p.P131R) in Caco-2 cells. Wild-type Caco-2 cells were selected as normal control group and the Caco-2 cells with successful expression of SLC26A3 c.392C>G (p.P131R) was selected as P131R group. Both groups were treated with 100 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor-\\xc3\\xa1 (TNF-\\xc3\\xa1), and then the normal control group was named as TNF-\\xc3\\xa1 group, and the P131R group was named as TNF-\\xc3\\xa1+P131R group. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assay was used to evaluate the change in the monolayer barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells in the above four groups, and Western blot was used to measure the change in the expression of SLC26A3 protein in the normal control group and the P131R group.RESULTS: The eukaryotic recombinant expression plasmid (pSpCas9-SLC26A3) was successfully constructed. Both Taqman genotyping assay and Sanger sequencing confirmed the successful establishment of the Caco-2 cell model of SLC26A3 c.392C>G (p.P131R) expression. ECIS assay showed that compared with the normal control group, the P131R group had a significant increase in the monolayer permeability of intestinal epithelial cells (P<0.05), and at the same time, the P131R group had a significantly greater increase in cell membrane permeability after the induction with 100 ng/mL TNF-\\xc3\\xa1 (P<0.05). Western blot showed that compared with the normal control group, the P131R group had a significant reduction in the expression of SLC26A3 protein (P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: SLC26A3 c.392C>G (p.P131R) can reduce the expression of SLC26A3 protein, increase the monolayer permeability of intestinal epithelial cells, and thus lead to diarrhea. labels: #Caco-2 Cells#Chloride-Bicarbonate Antiporters#Diarrhea#Humans#Intestinal Mucosa#Metabolism, Inborn Errors#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Sulfate Transporters#Tight Junctions#Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha'
b'Objective: To explore the characteristics of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism in twin pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: The clinical features of twin and singleton pregnancies complicated by GDM, which delivered in Peking University First Hospital from January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 286 twin pregnancies with GDM (GDM-T group) were collected, and 572 singleton pregnancies complicated by GDM (GDM-S group) which were matched by delivery time in a ratio of 1?2 among all singleton pregnancies with GDM. The characteristics of maternal glucolipid metabolism in the second trimesters of pregnancy was compared between two groups. Results: (1) Compared with GDM-S group, the maternal delivery age were lower [(32\\xc2\\xb14), (33\\xc2\\xb14) years] and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) were higher [(24\\xc2\\xb14), (23\\xc2\\xb14) kg/m(2)] in GDM-T group, the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). The incidence of chronic hypertension was found no significant difference (P=0.581). (2) The 3 points of glucose values in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and OGTT-area under curve (AUC) had no significant difference between GDM-T and GDM-S group.When compared with GDM-S group, the maternal glycosylated hemoglobin levels [(5.41\\xc2\\xb10.35)%, (5.32\\xc2\\xb10.28)%], the insulin resistance index (4.07\\xc2\\xb10.77, 2.63\\xc2\\xb11.50) and the proportion of insulin use (7.7%, 4.4%) were all significantly higher in GDM-T group (all P<0.05). The values of triglyceride [(3.4\\xc2\\xb11.4), (2.6\\xc2\\xb11.2) mmol/L], total cholesterol [(6.3\\xc2\\xb11.1), (6.0\\xc2\\xb11.0) mmol/L], low density lipoprotein cholesterol [(3.3\\xc2\\xb10.9), (3.1\\xc2\\xb10.8) mmol/L] were significantly higher and values of high density lipoprotein cholesterol [(1.7\\xc2\\xb10.4), (2.0\\xc2\\xb10.5) mmol/L] were significantly lower in GDM-T group than GDM-S group (all P<0.05). (3) There was no significant difference in the incidence of gestational hypertension between the two groups (P>0.05). When compared with GDM-S group, the incidences of preeclampsia and small for gestational age were both significantly higher (13.3% vs 2.4%; 28.7% vs 1.7%) and the incidence of large for gestational age was significantly lower in GDM-T group (4.5% vs 15.2%; all P<0.05). Conclusions: The insulin resistance is aggravated in twin pregnancies and the characteristics of lipid metabolism are different between singleton and twin pregnant women complicated by GDM, and there are more complications in twin GDM pregnancies. labels: #Blood Glucose#Diabetes, Gestational#Female#Glucose Tolerance Test#Humans#Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced#Pregnancy#Pregnancy, Twin#Retrospective Studies'
b'A two-step strategy was employed to culture Dunaliella tertiolecta, an oleaginous unicellular green alga, combined by the salt stress and sodium azide intervention, to observe their effects on its lipid accumulation. When the algae cultured at different salt concentrations reached the logarithmic growth phase, sodium azide was added. The results showed that the addition of sodium azide significantly increased the lipid content and had no significant effect on cell biomass. The lipid yield and single cell lipid content under 50\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\xacM sodium azide increased by 10.4% and 21.7%. Under the two-step culture condition, combining of the treatment of 50\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc3\\xacM sodium azide and 2.5\\xe2\\x80\\x89M salt stress, the total lipid productivity and single-cell lipid content were 10% and 70.5% higher than that of the control. It seemed that sodium azide and salinity might have a synergistic effect on the lipid accumulation of D. tertiolecta. It can be concluded that sodium azide is an effective inducer of lipid accumulation in D. tertiolecta, and two-stage cultivation is a feasible way to improve lipid accumulation in microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To establish a nude mouse model of subcutaneous lung cancer using dual fluorescence reporting genes of luciferase (Luc) and near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP). Methods: The Luc and iRFP expressed lentiviral vector was constructed by Gateway method. After verified by sequencing, the lentivirus particle was prepared and infected into lung cancer A549 cells. Successfully infected A549 (mA549) cells were selected by puromycin and amplified. The expression of Luc and iRFP were observed under fluorescence microscope, and the expression of c-Met protein on the cell surface was detected by immunofluorescence. Twelve female nude mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, 6 in each group. A549 and mA549 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right forelimb of nude mice. The growth and fluorescence expression of the tumor were observed by in vivo imaging. The tumor formation was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry. Results: The Luc and iRFP stably expressed mA549 cell line was successfully constructed. The expressions of iRFP and Luc in mA549 cells were observed under fluorescence microscope. The results of immunofluorescence showed that c-Met protein expressed in both A549 cells and mA549 cells. The growth period of mA549 xenograft in nude mice was moderate and the tumorigenesis rate was 100%. The growth trend of mA549 cells in vivo was not significantly different from that of A549 cells (P>0.05). HE staining and immunohistochemistry results showed that the tumor issues displayed typical histopathological features of tumor. Immunohistochemistry results showed that both A549 and mA549 tumors expressed c-Met protein. Conclusion: A stable, real-time monitoring model of iRFP-Luc-A549 lung cancer cell xenograft in nude mice was successfully constructed. labels: #A549 Cells#Animals#Cell Line, Tumor#Female#Fluorescence#Genes, Reporter#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Luciferases#Luminescent Proteins#Lung#Lung Neoplasms#Mice#Mice, Nude#Neoplasm Transplantation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met#Random Allocation'
b'Osteoclasts are multinucleated, giant cells originating from myeloid hematopoetic stem cells. These are the only cells in nature which can resorb bone. Differentiation of mononucleated osteoclast progenitor cells requires stimulation with M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) for the cells to proliferate and survive and with RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) for differentiation along the osteoclastic lineage to cells which eventually fuse to the mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. Therefore, most hormones and cytokines stimulating osteoclastogenesis do so indirectly by regulating the expression in osteoblasts of RANKL and its inhibitory decoy receptor OPG. Antibodies neutralizing RANKL is a common therapy to inhibit excessive osteoclast formation in diseases such as osteoporosis and malignant tumors with skeletal metastasis. Mature osteoclasts resorb bone by stimulating acid release into the resorption lacunae, followed by proteolytic degradation of bone matrix proteins. Loss-of-function mutations of proteins involved in acidification and proteolysis cause osteopetrosis, a disease with sclerotic bone due to non-functional osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are important for a healthy skeleton by removing damaged bone during remodeling of the skeleton, but are also important for modeling of bone, calcium homeostasis and tooth eruption, and possibly also for glucose and fat metabolism. Loss of bone in inflammatory disease, metastasizing tumors and osteoporosis is due to increased RANKL expression and enhanced osteoclast formation. The present overview aims to summarize how osteoclasts are formed and resorb bone in health and disease. labels: #Bone Resorption#Humans#Membrane Glycoproteins#Osteoblasts#Osteoclasts#Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW)-to-platelet count (PLT) ratio (RPR) on the first day of admission into the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in predicting the prognosis of children with sepsis.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 186 children with sepsis who were hospitalized in the PICU. According to their prognosis, they were divided into a survival group with 151 children and a death group with 35 children. Clinical data were compared between the two groups. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the prognosis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the value of RPR in predicting death. The children were divided into a high RPR group and a low RPR group according to the optimal cut-off value, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the 28-day survival rate between the two groups.RESULTS: Compared with the survival group, the death group had significantly higher RDW, procalcitonin (PCT) and RPR (P<0.05) and significantly lower PLT and albumin (ALB) (P<0.05). The Cox regression model analysis showed that low ALB, high PCT and high RPR were independent risk factors for the prognosis of children with sepsis (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that RPR had a certain value in predicting the prognosis of children with sepsis (P<0.05), with an area under the ROC curve of 0.937, an optimal cut-off value of 0.062, a sensitivity of 94.29%, and a specificity of 77.48%. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high RPR group had a significantly lower 28-day survival rate than the low RPR group (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: RPR on the first day of admission into the PICU is closely associated with the prognosis of children with sepsis and has an important value in predicting the prognosis of children with sepsis. labels: #Child#Erythrocytes#Humans#Platelet Count#Prognosis#ROC Curve#Retrospective Studies#Sepsis'
b'Haematococcus pluvialis is a main biological resource for the antioxidant astaxanthin production, however, potential modulators and molecular mechanisms underpinning astaxanthin accumulation remain largely obscured. We discovered that provision of ethanol (0.4%) significantly triggered the cellular astaxanthin content up to 3.85% on the 4th day of treatment. Amongst, 95% of the accumulated astaxanthin was esterified, particularly enriched with monoesters. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that ethanol altered cell wall structure and physiological properties. Antioxidant analyses revealed that astaxanthin accumulation offset the ethanol induced oxidative stress. Ethanol treatment reduced carbohydrates while increased lipids and jasmonic acid production. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered that ethanol orchestrated the expression of crucial genes involved in carotenogenesis, e.g. PSY, BKT and CRTR-b were significantly upregulated. Moreover, methyl jasmonic acid synthesis was induced and played a major role in regulating the carotenogenic genes. The findings uncovered the novel viewpoint in the intricate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of astaxanthin biosynthesis. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) metastasis forms the part of the N-staging of breast cancer, and affects the treatment program and prognosis. At present, IMLN metastasis is clinically diagnosed by anatomical imaging, functional imaging and postoperative pathology. Anatomical imaging includes ultrasound, CT and MRI. Functional image includes positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT), PET-MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SPECT-CT. Because of the special location of the internal mammary region and the complex anatomical structure around it, the imaging diagnosis rate and pathological diagnosis rate of IMLN are often different. Therefore, it is important to identify the relevant factors of IMLN metastasis for guiding the local treatment of internal mammary region, including the scope of surgery and radiotherapy. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Humans#Incidence#Lymph Nodes#Lymphatic Metastasis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Neoplasm Staging#Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography#Risk Factors#Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography'

The activation energies (182-256\\xe2\\x80\\xafkJ\\xe2\\x80\\xafmol-1) and their corresponding lower enthalpies at the conversional fractions from 0.2 to 0.6 indicated that product formation was being favored.

b"Objective To explore the inhibitory effects of polyphenols from Toona sinensis seeds (PTSS) on neuroinflammation and the underlying mechanism in rats with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods PD rat models were prepared by stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into one side of striatum of Sprague-Dawley male rats. Model rats were randomly divided into model group and PTSS group (n=10), and a normal control group was set as well (n=10). The rotational behavior of rats was induced by intraperitoneal injection of apomorphine (APO) after 30 days, and the behavioral changes of rats from each group were investigated. The morphological and quantity changes of DA neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase positive, TH-positive), microglia cells (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1, Iba1-positive) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP-positive) in substantia nigra (SN) of rats from each group were examined by immunohistochemistry. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor-\\xc3\\xaaB p65 (NF-\\xc3\\xaaBp65), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and phosphor-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38MAPK) levels were evaluated through immunohistochemical staining. The protein levels of TH, GFAP, p38MAPK and p-p38MAPK in SN were examined by Western blot analysis. Results The number of rotations in the rats of the PTSS group was significantly reduced compared with that in the model group. The number of TH-positive cells in the model group was much less than that in the control group. The number and protein levels of TH-positive cells were enhanced significantly by PTSS intervention. Compared with the control group, the protein levels of Iba1, GFAP, iNOS, NF-\\xc3\\xaaB, p38MAPK and p-p38MAPK in the injured side of the model group significantly increased, which could be suppressed significantly by PTSS intervention. Conclusion PTSS demonstrates protective effects on DA neurons by inhibiting p38MAPK signaling pathway and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors in PD rats. labels: #Animals#Dopaminergic Neurons#MAP Kinase Signaling System#Male#Meliaceae#Oxidopamine#Parkinson Disease#Phytochemicals#Polyphenols#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Seeds#Substantia Nigra"

Human glioma U251 cells were treated with histone acetylase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibition. The mRNA level of GDNF in glioma and normal controls was detected by Real-time PCR. H3K9 acetylation level of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) binding region on GDNF promoter and the ability of CREB combining to GDNF promoter were detected by ChIP-PCR. The effects of histone acetylase and deacetylase inhibitors on transcription factor binding ability and GDNF expression were detected.RESULTS: The mRNA level of GDNF in HG-glioma was significantly higher than those in normal brain tissue and LG-glioma (P < 0.01). The H3K9 acetylation level of GDNF promoter region in the glioma was increased compared to that in the normal brain tissue (P < 0.01), and the acetylation level in CREB-binding region on the GDNF promoter was higher than that in the non-CREB-binding region (P < 0.01). The binding activity of CREB and GDNF promoter in HG-glioma was higher than those in normal brain tissue and LG-glioma (P < 0.05). After treatment of U251 cells with histone acetyltransferase inhibition, the level of acetylation in CREB-binding region on GDNF promoter, the binding activity of CREB and GDNF promoter was decreased, and GDNF transcription and expression were down-regulated, while histone deacetylase inhibitors had the opposite effect (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Histone acetylation promotes the transcription expression of GDNF in glioma by promoting the binding of transcription factor CREB to the promoter region of GDNF gene. labels: #Acetylation#Cell Line, Tumor#Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor#Glioma#Histone Acetyltransferases#Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors#Histones#Humans#Promoter Regions, Genetic#Transcription, Genetic'
b'The present study is aimed to clarify the utility of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and the additional value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).This retrospective study involved 38 patients with PDAC concomitant with IPMN and 114 patients (control) who were randomly selected from 320 patients with IPMN without PDAC and were matched with cases for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strength (1.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8aT/3.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8aT). Two radiologists reviewed the 2 MR image sets with relevant clinical information blinded, first MRCP alone and then combined MRI set including DWI. Diagnostic capability and interobserver agreement were assessed by using receiver operating characteristics curve (Az) analysis and weighted \\xc3\\xaa statistics.Az values for the 2 observers were 0.834 and 0.821 for MRCP alone and 0.964 and 0.926 for the combined MRI (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001 and P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), respectively. The sensitivity of MRCP alone was 61% (23/38), with both observers failing to diagnose PDACs located at the end of tail or away from the pancreatic duct. Meanwhile, with combined MRI, sensitivity was significantly increased for both observers (61% to 92%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.002; 61% to 87%, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.004). Moreover, the interobserver agreement was higher with combined MRI (\\xc3\\xaa\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.85) than MRCP alone (\\xc3\\xaa\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.59).MRCP and DWI might be a superior option with a higher diagnostic capability of PDAC concomitant with IPMN than MRCP alone, especially for tumors away from the pancreatic duct. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal#Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance#Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Neoplasms, Multiple Primary#Pancreatic Intraductal Neoplasms#Pancreatic Neoplasms#Retrospective Studies'
b'OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of Guben Zenggu Decoction on bone metabolism and bone microstructure in ovariectomized rats for the purpose of preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.METHODS: Osteoporosis rat models were established by ovariectomy. The model rats were randomly divided into control, estradiol valerate treatment, and Guben Zenggu Decoction treatment groups with high, medium and low dosages. After 12 weeks of treatments, 10 rats from each group were randomly selected for cardiac blood sampling after abdominal anesthesia. The serum levels of estradiol (E2), osteocalcin (BGP), carboxyterminal of type ? procollagen (PICP), collagen type ? pyridine crosslinking peptide (ICTP) and acid tartaric acid phosphatase-5b (TRAP-5b) were determined by ELISA. Bone histomorphometric analysis was performed on the right femoral specimen of rats using micro-CT imaging.RESULTS: The models rats had lower levels of E2, bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and relative bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), number of trabeculae (Tb.N) and connectivity density (Conn.D), and higher levels of BGP, ICTP, PICP, TRAP-5b and degree of trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), structural model index (SMI) than their normal counterparts (P < 0.05). Estradiol valerate and Guben Zenggu Decoction treatments increased the levels of E2, BALP, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Conn.D significantly (P < 0.05). Higher doses of Guben Zenggu Decoction resulted in higher changes (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Guben Zenggu Decoction can improve bone metabolism and bone micro-structure in ovariectomized rats, thus playing a preventive and therapeutic role in postmenopausal osteoporosis. labels: #Animals#Bone Density#Bone and Bones#Drugs, Chinese Herbal#Female#Osteoporosis#Ovariectomy#Random Allocation#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#X-Ray Microtomography'
b'Objective: To explore the short-term efficacy and prognosis of palliative surgical treatment for malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) caused by peritoneal metastasis of colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) primary colorectal cancer; (2) massive peritoneal metastasis; (3)obstructive site located below Treitz ligament by imaging; (4) obstruction refractory to conservative treatment; (5) estimated rese survival time more than 2 months; (6) patients and their families had strong willingness for operation; (7) surgical treatment included stoma/bypass and debulking surgery. In accordance with the above criteria, clinicopathological data of 46 patients undergoing palliative surgery at Peking University Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, Unit III from January 2016 to October 2018 were retrospectively collected. Postoperative symptomatic relief rate, morbidity of complication within 30 days, complication classification (Clavien-Dindo classification), mortality and survival after operation were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate survival and Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors. Results: Among 46 patients, 30 were male and 16 were female with median age of 63 (19-87) years; 23 patients received stoma/bypass surgery (stoma/bypass group), and 23 cases received tumor debulking surgery (debulking group). The overall symptom relief rate was 76.1% (35/46), while symptom relief rate in the debulking group was 91.3% (21/23), which was significantly higher than 60.9% (14/23) in the stoma/bypass group (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=4.301, P=0.038). Postoperative complications occurred in 25 patients. The complication rate was 52.2% (12/23) in the debulking group and 56.5% (13/23) in the stoma/bypass group, without statistically significant difference (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.088, P=0.767). Morbidity of complication beyond grade III was 8.7% (2/23) and 13.0% (3/23) in the debulking group and stoma/bypass group respectively, without statistically significant difference (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.224, P=0.636). Four patients died within 30 days after operation, 2 (8.7%) in each group. Twenty-four patients underwent 1-8 cycles of chemotherapy \\xc2\\xb1 targeting therapy (regimens: CapeOX \\xc2\\xb1 Bevacizumab, FOLFOX/FOLFIRI \\xc2\\xb1 Bevacizumab/Cetuximab), including 10 cases in the stoma/bypass group and 14 cases in the debulking group. Two patients of debulking group received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy (50.6 Gy/22 f, with concurrent oral capecitabine). Till the last follow up of April 2019, 34 patients died (34/46, 73.9%) with a median overall survival time of 6.4 months, and the 6-month and 1-year survival rate was 54.5% and 29.2% respectively. The median survival time in the debulking group was significantly longer than that in the stoma/bypass group (11.5 months vs. 5.2 months, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=5.117, P=0.024). The median survival time of the 35 patients with symptomatic relief after operation was significant longer than that of 11 patients without relief (7.1 months vs 5.1 months, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.844, P=0.050). Multivariate analysis showed stoma/bypass surgery (HR=2.917, 95%CI:1.357-6.269, P=0.006) and greater omental metastasis (HR=4.060, 95%CI:1.419-11.617, P=0.009) were independent risk factors associated with prognosis of patients with MBO caused by peritoneal mCRC. Conclusions: For patients of MBO caused by peritoneal mCRC, tumor debulking surgery may achieve higher symptom relief rate and prolong survival. Greater omental metastasis indicates poor prognosis. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Colorectal Neoplasms#Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures#Female#Humans#Intestinal Obstruction#Male#Middle Aged#Omentum#Palliative Care#Peritoneal Neoplasms#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Young Adult'
b'OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in the cognitive function and hippocampal ultrastructure of elderly rats exposed to sevoflurane.METHODS: Ault male Sprague-Dawley rats were given subcutaneous injection of D-galactose on the neck for 40 d to establish elderly models, after 9-day behavioral training. The model rats were divided into 3 groups randomly: control group with natural air, A/O group with 6 h exposure to carrier gas (2 L/min Air+2 L/min O2), and Sev group with 6 h exposure to 3.2% sevoflurane through carrier gas. Morris Water Maze and balance beam experiment were conducted on 6 rats in each group 2 h, 1 week and 4 weeks after treatments, respectively. The hippocampal tissues of the rats were rapidly dissected and prepared by glutaraldehyde fixation, ethanol dehydration, infiltration, embedding polymerization, semimembrane section localization and staining for examinations under transmission electron microscopy. The hippocampal ultrastructure such as nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, medullary nerve fiber, synapse and apoptotic corpuscle were observed.RESULTS: Ethology: compared with the control and A/O groups, significant reductions in the probe trial capability were found in the rats after 2 h exposure to sevoflurane, which recovered at 1 week and 4 weeks. Sevoflurane also increased the working memory escape latency 2 h and 1 week after exposure. The balance beam experiment showed that sevoflurane prolonged the staring time of rats after 2 h exposure, which recovered at 1 week and 4 weeks. Prolonged length for going through the balance beam was found consistently in the rats exposed to sevoflurane. Transmission electron microscopy: rats in the control group were found to have clear hippocampal ultrastructure, intact nuclear membrane, no edema fluid in the cytoplasm, intact mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, normal medullary nerve fibers, intact synaptic structure, and no apoptotic bodies in the cells. But a small amount of edema were observed in the cytoplasm of hippocampal cells in the rats exposed to sevoflurane and A/O at 2 h, which increased at 1 week. The cytoplasmic morphology of rats in the A/O group returned to normal at 4 weeks. But further increase of edema was observed in the rats 4 weeks after exposure to sevoflurane. No abnormal morphological structures or apoptotic bodies in other organelles were found.CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane can induce early neurocognitive impairments in elderly rats, which may be related with changes in the hippocampus ultrastructure. labels: #Aging#Animals#Cognition#Hippocampus#Male#Maze Learning#Random Allocation#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Sevoflurane'
b'Chytrids are early diverging lineages of true fungi that reproduce with posteriorly uniflagellate zoospores. In aquatic ecosystems, parasitic chytrids of algae have important ecological roles by influencing the population dynamics of phytoplankton and transferring nutrients and energy from inedible algae to zooplankton via zoospores. Despite their ecological importance, information on parasitic chytrids is lacking in the current systematics of chytrids. Here, we investigated a novel chytrid culture KS100 that parasitizes the green alga, Microglena coccifera (Volvocales). A cross-inoculation experiment revealed that KS100 infection was specific to the genus Microglena. Thallus morphology of KS100 is characterized by spherical or subspherical zoosporangium, which becomes slightly angular during zoospore discharge, 2-3 small and inoperculate pores from where zoospores are discharged, and rhizoids branching at the base that extends in a fan-like shape. This combination of characteristics was distinct from any other known chytrids. In molecular phylogeny, KS100 was placed in the order Rhizophydiales and was distinguished from any known families in the order. Zoospores of KS100 possessed a kinetosome-associated structure whose morphology and positioning were unique among the Rhizophydiales. Based on these results, we describe this chytrid as Collimyces mutans gen. et sp. nov. in the new family Collimycetaceae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current status of neglect in children aged 3-6 years in the rural areas of Urumqi, China and risk factors for neglect.METHODS: Stratified random cluster sampling was performed to select 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89326 children, aged 3-6 years, from 6 kindergartens in the rural areas of Urumqi. A self-designed questionnaire and "Chinese Neglect Evaluation Questionnaire for Rural Children Aged 3-6 Years" were used for investigation.RESULTS: Of the 1\\xe2\\x80\\x89326 children, the neglect rate was 51.89% (688 cases), and the degree of neglect was 49\\xc2\\xb16. There were significant differences in the neglect rate and the degree of neglect between the children in different age groups (P<0.01). The single-parent families and the remarried families had significantly higher child neglect rate and degree of neglect than the families of three generations under one roof and the core families (P<0.01). The children in left-behind status had a significantly higher degree of neglect (P<0.01). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that younger children, mothers with low education level, employment status of the mother as a migrant worker, single-parent and remarried families, low-income families, and left-behind status were risk factors for child neglect (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The neglect of children aged 3-6 years in the rural areas of Urumqi is serious, and more attention should be paid to younger children, children whose mothers with low education level, left-behind children, and children from single-parent families, remarried families and low-income families. labels: #Child#Child Abuse#Child, Preschool#China#Female#Humans#Mothers#Risk Factors#Rural Population#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b'BACKGROUND: The ideal ablation strategy and end point for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) have not been well founded. Defining periprocedural AF termination as the end point of catheter ablation is still controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the differences between periprocedural AF termination and non-termination in the long-term AF recurrence rate and postoperative complications.METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a systematic search of electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library from January 2008 to August 2019. The primary outcome was freedom from AF or any atrial arrhythmia without antiarrhythmic drugs at the long-term (?12 months) follow-up. The secondary outcome was overall postoperative complication rates. The risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled for these outcomes. A forest plot, fixed-effects model or random-effect model, Q test, I statistic, and Egger funnel plot were used in the statistical analysis.RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant difference was found in freedom from AF at the long-term follow-up between patients in whom AF termination was achieved and not achieved (RR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.93, 95% CI\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.78-1.09, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.36, I\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a69%). Patients with AF non-termination had a lower complication occurrence rate than those with AF termination (RR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.74, 95% CI\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.11-2.73, P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02, I\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0%).CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that AF termination is not a reliable procedural end point during ablation of persistent AF. labels: #Atrial Fibrillation#Catheter Ablation#Humans#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Treatment Outcome'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore whether manual acupuncture stimulation of "Shenshu " (BL23), "Guanyuan" (CV4), "Zhongwan" (CV12) can improve the ovarian function by resisting oxidant stress and reducing apoptosis of granulosa cells in rats with ovarian hypofunction.METHODS: Forty female SD rats with normal estrous cycles were randomly divided into blank control, model, hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (n=10 rats in each group). The ovarian hypofunction model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides suspension (50 mg\\xc2\\xb7kg-1\\xc2\\xb7d-1) for 14 successive days. Rats of the hormone therapy group were treated by gavage of estrogen and progesterone, and those of the acupuncture group treated by manual acupuncture stimulation of bilateral BL23 or CV4 and CV12 alternatively by using uniform reinforcing-reducing method for 10 s every 5 min (3 times in 10 min). The treatment was performed once daily for 14 days. The blank group was given equal volume of normal saline daily. On the 9th day, the estrous cycle of each rat was observed by means of vaginal smear test. The ovarian index, serum estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were detected by ELISA. Histopathological changes of the ovary tissue were observed by H.E. staining. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 and their mRNAs of the ovaries were determined by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real time-PCR separately.RESULTS: The menstrual disorder rate was 100% in the model group, and was significantly higher than those in the hormone therapy (30%) and acupuncture (40%) groups (P<0.01). Following modeling, the ovarian wet weight and index, E2 and SOD contents, Bcl-2 protein and mRNA expressions were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05), and serum FSH, LH and MDA levels, Bax protein and mRNA expressions were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01) in the model group in comparison with the blank control group. H.E. staining showed a large amount of connective tissue in the ovary, with fewer mature follicles, increase of atresia follicles, significant reduction of luteal tissue, and appearance of scarring tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, there were more mature follicles, fewer atresia follicles, lower abnormal granulosa cell morphology and lower estrous cycle disorder ratio in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups. After the interventions, the decreased ovarian wet weight and index, serum E2 and SOD contents, expressions of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the increased levels of FSH and LH, MDA, expressions of Bax protein and mRNA were significantly decreased in both hormone therapy and acupuncture groups (P<0.05, P<0.01). The effect of acupuncture was significantly superior to that of hormone in up-regulating SOD, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expressions (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve the menstrual disorder in rats with ovarian hypofunction, which is closely related to its effects in improving antioxidant stress ability and regulating the expressions of apoptosis-related protein and mRNA of ovarian gra-nulosa cells. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#Apoptosis#Female#Glycosides#Oxidative Stress#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Tripterygium'
b'A disease outbreak in 42-d-old black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon juveniles from a commercial aquaculture farm in Kerala, India, was investigated. The cause of the disease outbreak was confirmed as Vibrio parahaemolyticus by biochemical tests, PCR targeting the toxR gene and pathogenicity testing of the isolates. All of the isolates tested negative by PCR specific for V. parahaemolyticus associated with acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), implicating vibriosis unrelated to AHPND as the cause of mortality. Among the 19 isolates obtained, 2 possessed the tdh gene (coding for thermo-stable hemolysin), whereas none of the isolates possessed trh. The LD50 value of 8 isolates of V. parahaemolyticus from diseased and apparently healthy shrimp ranged from 2.7 ? 104 to 4.9 ? 105 CFU ml-1 by immersion challenge of P. monodon postlarvae. BOX-PCR and dendrogram analysis of the bacterial isolates revealed that the isolates from moribund and apparently healthy shrimp formed separate clusters, indicating that these isolates originate from separate clones. The isolates from moribund shrimp including tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus clustered together. The present study represents the first report of tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus causing disease in a shrimp farm. labels: #Animals#Aquaculture#India#Penaeidae#Vibrio parahaemolyticus'
b'Objective: To investigate the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for selective fetal reduction in complex multiple pregnancies and analyze factors affecting perinatal outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective case series of 156 patients undergoing selective fetal reduction by RFA in Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University from July 22th, 2011 to September 12th, 2018. They were divided into five groups according to surgical indications, including 46 cases in the monochorionic twins discordant for fetal anomalies group, 42 cases in the multiple pregnancies for reducing fetal numbers group, 40 cases in the twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) group, 24 cases in the selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) group and 4 cases in the twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (TRAPS) group. According to the gestational age at surgery, patients were divided into two groups: the gestational age at surgery <20 weeks group (75 cases) and the gestational age at surgery?20 weeks group (81 cases). According to the cycles of RFA required for surgery, patients were divided into two groups: one cycle group (124 cases) and ?2 cycles group (32 cases). Basic information of patients, surgical process, postoperative complications and pregnancy outcomes were recorded. The growth and development of survival newborns were also followed up. Factors affecting perinatal outcomes were analyzed. Results: (1) The median gestational age at procedure of 156 patients was 20 weeks (14(+5)- 29(+1) weeks). The median cycles of RFA was 1 cycle (1-3 cycles), of which one cycle accounted for 79.5% (124/156). (2) Eleven (7.1%, 11/156) patients experienced intrauterine fetal death, 27 (17.3%, 27/156) patients miscarried, and the overall survival rate was 75.6% (118/156). Premature birth rate before 34 weeks was 19.5% (23/118). There were 129 neonates. The median gestational age at delivery was 37(+3) weeks (28(+2)- 41(+1) weeks) with a mean birth weight of (2 657\\xc2\\xb1700) g. (3) Analysis of pregnancy outcomes based on surgical indications found that, the gestational age at delivery [38 weeks (30(+1)-41(+1) weeks), 36(+4) weeks (29- 39 weeks), 36(+4) weeks (28(+2)-39(+5) weeks), 38 weeks (31-39(+6) weeks), 38(+3) weeks (30(+4)-38(+4) weeks)] and neonatal birth weight [(2 820\\xc2\\xb1671), (2 435\\xc2\\xb1416), (2 497\\xc2\\xb1843), (2 998\\xc2\\xb1718), (2 517\\xc2\\xb11 087) g] were significantly different among fetal anomalies group, reducing fetal numbers group, TTTS group, sIUGR group and TRAPS group, respectively (all P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the pregnancy outcomes between gestational age at surgery <20 weeks group and gestational age at surgery ?20 weeks group, or between one cycle group and ?2 cycles group, respectively (all P>0.05). Conclusions: RFA is a safe and effective procedure in treating complex monochorionic multiple pregnancies. Surgical indications would affect the gestational age at delivery and neonatal outcomes. labels: #Catheter Ablation#Delivery, Obstetric#Female#Fetofetal Transfusion#Gestational Age#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Outcome#Pregnancy Reduction, Multifetal#Pregnancy, Twin#Radiofrequency Ablation#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome#Twins, Monozygotic'
b'Some metal-based engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) undergo fast dissolution and/or aggregation when they are released in the environment. The underlying processes are controlled by psychochemical/biological parameters of the environment and the properties of the particles. In this study, we investigated the interaction between algal cells and zero valent copper nanoparticles (Cu0-ENPs) to elucidate how the cells influence the dissolution and aggregation kinetics of the particles and how these kinetics influence the cellular uptake of Cu. Our finding showed that the concentration of dissolved Cu ([Cu]dissolved) in the supernatant of the culture media without algal cells was higher than the [Cu]dissolved in the media with algal cells. In the absence of the cells, dissolved organic matter (DOC) increased the dissolution of the particle due to increasing the stability of the particles against aggregation, thus increasing the available surface area. In the presence of algae, Cu0-ENPs heteroaggregated with the cells. Thus, the available surface area decreased over time and this resulted in a low dissolution rate of the particles. The DOC corona on the surface of the particles increased the heteroaggregation of the particles with the cells and decreases the uptake of the particles. Our findings showed that microorganisms influence the fate of ENPs in the environment, and they do so by modifying the dissolution and aggregation kinetics of the Cu0-ENPs. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Carotenoids are implicated in alleviating ageing and age-related diseases in humans. While data from different carotenoids are mixed in their outcomes, those for 9-cis-\\xc3\\xa2-carotene indicate general positive effects, although basic data on its biological impact are limited. Here, we show that supplementation with 9-cis-\\xc3\\xa2-carotene in ageing Drosophila melanogaster improved mitochondrial function in terms of ATP production and whole-body respiration and extended mean lifespan. It also resulted in improved mobility. These data provide a potential biological rational for the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with 9-cis-\\xc3\\xa2-carotene. These effects may be based on the maintenance of a sound mitochondrial function. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Culture experiments were conducted on ten phytoplankton species to examine their biological and physiological responses during exposure to oil and a combination of oil and dispersant. The species tested included a range of taxa typically found in the Gulf of Mexico such as cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and diatoms. Cultures were exposed to Macondo surrogate oil using the water accommodated fraction (WAF), and dispersed oil using a chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and diluted CEWAF, to replicate conditions following the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A range of responses were observed, that could broadly class the algae as either "robust" or "sensitive" to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Robust algae were identified as Synechococcus elongatus, Dunaliella tertiolecta, two pennate diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula sp., and Skeletonema grethae CCMP775, and were largely unaffected by any of the treatments (no changes to growth rate or time spent in lag phase relative to controls). The rest of the phytoplankton, all centric diatoms, exhibited at least some combination of reduced growth rates or increased lag time in response to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Photophysiology did not have a strong treatment effect, with significant inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency (Fv /Fm ) only observed in the CEWAF, if at all. We found that the effects of oil and dispersants on phytoplankton physiology were species-dependent, and not always detrimental. This has significant implications on how oil spills might impact phytoplankton community structure and bloom dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico, which in turn impacts higher trophic levels. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Radiation-induced bowel injury is a common complication of radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy. Given the huge number of patients diagnosed with pelvic malignancy, the number of patients diagnosed with radiation-induced bowel injury increased year by year, which put a great burden on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of radiation-induced bowel injury. In particular, chronic radiation-induced bowel injury, which is manifested in the process of prolonged, repeated and progressive aggravation, seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients and makes clinical diagnosis and treatment difficult. However, due to insufficient attention and understanding from doctors and patients, standardized diagnosis and treatment of radiation-induced bowel injury still have a long way to go. Radiation-induced bowel injury is self-limited but irreversible. During diagnosis, we should pay attention to overall evaluation of the stage of disease based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic examination, imaging examination, pathology and nutritional risk. The treatment methods include health education, drug therapy, enema therapy, formalin local treatment, endoscopic treatment and surgical treatment, etc. The treatment decision-making should be based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic or imaging findings to alleviate the clinical symptoms of patients as the primary goal and to improve the long-term quality of life of patients as the ultimate goal. labels: #Chronic Disease#Humans#Intestinal Diseases#Intestines#Pelvic Neoplasms#Quality of Life#Radiation Injuries#Radiotherapy'
b"Chronic critical illness (CCI) refers to a group of critically ill patients who survive the acute phase of intensive care, but with persistent organ dysfunction, thus entering a chronic period of continuous dependence on life support system, and still need to stay in intensive care unit (ICU) for a long time. Persistent inflammatory response-immunosuppression-catabolic syndrome (PICS) is the main pathophysiological feature of CCI. Three factors interact to form a vicious circle, leading to poor prognosis. Nutritional support therapy is a key link in the comprehensive treatment of CCI. Enteral nutrition (EN) should be started as soon as possible if conditions permit. If EN can not be implemented, temporary or transitional parenteral nutrition (PN) should be used, and EN should be added gradually in time. At the same time, the amount of PN should be gradually reduced. When EN meets more than 60% of patients' energy and protein requirements, PN can be considered to be discontinued. The main strategies and functions of CCI nutritional support therapy are as follows: strengthening high protein supply to correct negative nitrogen balance and inhibit catabolism, selecting branched chain amino acids (BCAA) to promote anabolism, using immunomodulators (arginine, \\xc3\\xb93 polyunsaturated fatty acids) to improve immune suppression and inflammatory response, supplementing micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) to counteract the decrease in intake and the increase in consumption, and adding probiotics to maintain the intestinal microecological balance, and so on. Reasonable nutritional support therapy not only improve malnutrition of CCI patients, but also help to reduce complications, thus speeding up rehabilitation, improving prognosis, shortening ICU hospitalization time, and even reducing mortality. labels: #Chronic Disease#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Nutritional Support"
b'In this study, we estimated the toxicity risks from river sediments that were affected by multiple pollutants in the Haihe River Basin. We used a range of methods to determine the concentrations, bioavailability, and toxicity of a range of metals and contaminants in sediments and sediment porewater and then assessed the ecological risks and toxicity using various multivariate statistical approaches. We found that more than 70% of the samples were toxic. The concentrations of non-ionic ammonia (0.168-9.295\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1) were generally high in the sediment porewater, while the concentrations of bioavailable chromium (Cr) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also high in the porewater samples from NW01 and NW02, respectively. We used the toxic unit (TU) approach, based on the bioavailable pollutant concentrations, to determine the toxicity of PAHs, heavy metals, and non-ionic ammonia in river sediments and sediment porewater. We found that non-ionic ammonia was the main source of toxicity for Daphnia magna, and that Cr and zinc were toxic for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chironomus dilutus. By combining various indexes, we identified the main contributors to the toxicity in sediments collected from rivers affected by multiple pollutants. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Astaxanthin and lutein, antioxidants used in nutraceutics and cosmetics, can be extracted from several microalgal species. In this work, investigations on astaxanthin and lutein extraction from Haematococcus pluvialis (H. pluvialis) in the red phase were carried out by means of the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) technique, in which CO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 supercritical fluid was used as the extracting solvent with ethanol as the co-solvent. The experimental activity was performed using a bench-scale reactor in semi-batch configuration with varying extraction times (20, 40, 60, and 80 min), temperatures (50, 65, and 80 \\xc2\\xb0C) and pressures (100, 400, and 550 bar). Moreover, the performance of CO\\xe2\\x82\\x82 SFE with ethanol was compared to that without ethanol. The results show that the highest astaxanthin and lutein recoveries were found at 65 \\xc2\\xb0C and 550 bar, with ~18.5 mg/g dry weight (~92%) astaxanthin and ~7.15 mg/g dry weight (~93%) lutein. The highest astaxanthin purity and the highest lutein purity were found at 80 \\xc2\\xb0C and 400 bar, and at 65 \\xc2\\xb0C and 550 bar, respectively. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: The aim of the current study is to compare the short-term clinical outcomes between Billroth-I reconstruction using an overlap method and delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG). Method: A retrospective cohort study was performed. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) Preoperative gastroscopy and CT confirmed that the tumor is located in the antrum of the stomach, and the biopsy suggested adenocarcinoma; (2) Chest, abdomen and pelvis enhanced CT showed no evidence of distant metastasis; (3) Preoperative gastric reconstruction CT or endoscopic ultrasonography suggested that the clinical stage of the tumor is stage I-III. (4) During the operation, the tumor position was confirmed to be located in the antrum of the stomach by nanocarbon injection or gastroscope; (5) Complete laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for distal gastrectomy, and the gastrointestinal reconstruction was performed by delta-shaped anastomosis or overlap anastomosis. And the following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) History of gastric surgery; (2) Patients who cannot tolerate laparoscopic surgery because of comorbidities. Finally, data on 43 consecutive patients who underwent TLDG with Billroth-I reconstruction between January 2016 and November 2018 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into those who underwent Billroth-I reconstruction using an overlap method (n=20) or using delta-shaped anastomosis (n=23). The demographic and clinical characteristics and perioperative data of the two groups were analyzed. Measurement data that conformed to the normal distribution were expressed as the mean \\xc2\\xb1 s, and differences between groups were compared using Student's t-test; comparisons between the counting data groups were performed using the \\xc3\\xb7(2) test or the continuously corrected \\xc3\\xb7(2) test. Results: The demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the delta-shaped group and the overlap group (P>0.05). There was no significant difference between groups regarding operation time [(185.9\\xc2\\xb122.8) minutes vs. (184.0\\xc2\\xb125.8) minutes, t=0.260, P=0.796], blood loss [(50.9\\xc2\\xb136.0) ml vs. (47.0\\xc2\\xb130.8) ml, t=0.375, P=0.709], number of stapler reloads used for anastomosis (5.1\\xc2\\xb10.3 vs. 5.2\\xc2\\xb10.6, t=-0.465, P=0.651), time to flatus [(3.3\\xc2\\xb10.9) days vs. (3.6\\xc2\\xb10.9) days, t=-1.067, P=0.292) and postoperative hospitalization [(8.8\\xc2\\xb13.1) days vs. (10.4\\xc2\\xb13.8) days,t=-1.494, P=0.143]. As for the delta-shaped group and the overlap group, the anastomotic leakage rate was 4.3% (1/23) and 0 (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000), respectively. The incidence of anastomotic bleeding was 4.3% (1/23) and 5.0% (1/20) (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000), while the incidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage was 4.3% (1/23) and 0 (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=0.000, P=1.000). The incidence of gastric emptying disorders was 4.3% (1/23) and 30.0% (6/20), respectively (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=3.454, P=0.063). All complications were cured after conservative treatment or symptomatic treatment. Conclusion: The overlap method for Billroth-I reconstruction is safe and feasible. labels: #Gastrectomy#Gastroenterostomy#Humans#Laparoscopy#Retrospective Studies#Stomach Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome"
b'Introduction: The attitude to immunization and the issue of vaccine hesitancy in health care workers (HCWs) have been studied in a former survey performed by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). Aim: Our aim was to study the immunization attitude of primary care paediatricians, general practitioners and primary care nurses in Hungary. Method: We studied vaccine hesitancy in HCWs by way of a questionnaire, developed on the basis of a recent similar survey by ECDC in four countries. The online survey has been performed between May and July 2017. Altogether 765 questionnaires have been returned: 189 primary care paediatricians, 375 general practitioners working in adult or mixed practices, and 201 primary care nurses. The sample has been weighted to the country-specific features - e.g., location of the practice, residence and age of the HCWs - within each of the three groups, so from this aspect it can be considered representative. Results: Our results did not differ substantially from the international ECDC data. Approximately 2/3 of the primary care doctors and about 50% of the primary care nurses were convinced of the benefit and value of vaccines. Data on vaccine hesitancy were consolingly low, though the data on recommended vaccines were somewhat higher compared to the age related/NIP (National Immunization Plan) vaccines. The well-known vaccine scares - e.g., autism-MMR, etc., known also from the literature - could hardly been detected, and it can be explained by the voluntary participation in the study. The least supported vaccine is BCG, while the highest hesitancy rates are related to MMR in Hungary. Conclusion: The need to improve immunization-related communication among primary HCWs could clearly been detected - both in gradual and in post-gradual training programs.

b'An acidic cultivation strategy was developed to prevent contamination of a lethal fungus Paraphysoderma sedebokerensis in Haematococcus pluvialis culture for astaxanthin production. Instead of generally used neutral pH, an acidic condition (pH 4) was applied to the cultivation, resulting in a significant inhibition of the fungal contamination. This could be ascribed to the acidity-associated denaturation of a surface protein of P. sedebokerensis, which plays an important role in recognition of H. pluvialis. Stress relief strategies including stepwise light irradiation and naturally occurring nitrogen deficiency were employed in the induction stage to minimize the reduction of astaxanthin production caused by acidic pH. Accordingly, an astaxanthin titer of 84.8\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1 was obtained, which is 141-fold of that from the completely contaminated culture and double of that without the stress relief methods. This strategy provides a persistent contamination control method that can be used for practical astaxanthin production by H. pluvialis. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The system of the green microalgal order Protosiphonales (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta) constructed\\nbased on morphological, ecological, and molecular genetic data is considered.

b'At the beginning of 2009, the 38th principle of the Administrative Measures for Clinical Application of Medical Technology, issued by the former Ministry of Health, clearly pointed out that medical institutions should establish a hierarchical management system for surgery. Then the Trial of Administrative Measures for Surgical Classification of Medical Institutions was published and implemented in 2012, but the official introduction of surgical classification catalogue in the national level has not been seen. Therefore, the writing group of this expert consensus has organized numerous well-known experts and scholars in China, taking the three elements of the 38th principle of the Administrative Measures for Clinical Application of Medical Technology issued by the Ministry of Health--risk coefficient, complexity, and technical difficulty as the basic norm to grade scientifically through the four indicators of burn index, surgical area, surgical repair method, and anesthesia risk (each indicator with 4 grades and scores). The total score is then accumulated to divide four grades of operations. The Expert Consensus on Classification Evaluation Methods of Burn Surgery in China (2019 Version) is strategized together expecting to provide academic reference for the government departments to issue or further improve and perfect surgical classification catalogue in the national level as soon as possible, and lay a foundation for the stable development of burn discipline with the significance of national strategic reserve. labels: #Burns#China#Consensus#Humans#Practice Guidelines as Topic'
b'Nanomechanical and structural characterisations of algal cells are of key importance for understanding their adhesion behaviour at interfaces in the aquatic environment. We examine here the nanomechanical properties and adhesion dynamics of the algal cells during two phases of their growth using complementary surface methods and the mathematical modelling. Mechanical properties of motile cells are hard to assess while keeping cells viable, and studies to date have been limited. Immobilisation of negatively charged cells to a positively charged substrate enables high-resolution AFM imaging and nanomechanical measurements. Cells were stiffer and more hydrophobic in the exponential than in the stationary phase, suggesting molecular modification of the cell envelope during aging. The corresponding properties of algal cells were in agreement with the increase of critical interfacial tensions of adhesion, determined amperometrically. Cells in exponential phase possessed a larger cell volume, in agreement with the large amount of amperometrically measured displaced charge at the interface. Differences in the kinetics of adhesion and spreading of cells at the interface were attributed to their various volumes and nanomechanical properties that varied during cell aging. Our findings contribute to the present body of knowledge on the biophysics of algal cells on a fundamental level. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of CT in the differential diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis and fungal ball in paranasal sinus caused by Aspergilus flavus. Methods: In this retrospective study, CT results of 74 cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis including 31 male cases and 43 female cases with age onset from 15 to 74 years old (mean\\xc2\\xb1SD was 50\\xc2\\xb113) and 72 cases of fungal ball in paranasal sinus caused by Aspergilus flavus including 28 male cases and 44 female cases with age onset from 25 to 78 years old (mean\\xc2\\xb1SD was 53\\xc2\\xb115) at Beijing Tongren Hospital confirmed by histopathology were enrolled from January 2013 to May 2017. The CT characteristics of the two groups of cases were compared using \\xc3\\xb7(2) test, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Soft tissue opacification of the involved paranasal sinus was found on CT in each case of the two groups. There were significant differences in the rate of single sinus involvement (44.6% and 90.3% respectively), the incidence of lesion associated with maxillary sinus (91.9% and 70.8% respectively), ethmoid sinus (41.9% and 2.8% respectively), frontal sinus (29.7% and 0 respectively), calcification (50.0% and 72.2% respectively), and the enlargement of maxillary sinus opening (13.2% and 35.3% respectively), in addition to the central calcification (83.8% and 59.6% respectively) between the two groups (all P<0.05). However, the incidence of sphenoid sinus involvement (32.4% and 34.7% respectively), bone sclerosis (56.8% and 62.5% respectively) or destruction(18.9% and 16.7% respectively) were not found different between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Though the CT findings are similar between the two diseases such as soft tissue opacification of the involved paranasal sinus with calcification and bone sclerosis or destruction, there are still a few characteristics on CT in differentiating the one from the other. The involvement of multi-sinuses, maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus and frontal sinus, the central calcification are more common in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa sinusitis. However, the CT features including single sinus involvement, calcification and enlargement of maxillary sinus opening, can be seen more often in the fungal ball in paranasal sinus caused by Aspergilus flavus. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Diagnosis, Differential#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Paranasal Sinuses#Pseudomonas Infections#Pseudomonas aeruginosa#Retrospective Studies#Sinusitis#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Young Adult'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of moxibustion pretreatment at different time on serum hormone levels in diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) rats, so as to explore its protective mechanisms.METHODS: Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into control, model, moxibustion-1 (moxibustion was given 4 weeks before modeling), moxibustion-2 (moxibustion was given 2 weeks before modeling and 2 weeks from the 1st day on after modeling ) and moxibustion-3 (moxibustion was given 4 weeks from the 1st day on after modeling) groups (n=8 rats in each group). The DOR model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides (75 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. Grain-moxibustion was applied to "Shenshu" (BL23) and "Guanyuan" (CV4) for 7 cones, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The body weight and the ovary weight were recorded for calculating the ovarian index. The levels of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), androgen (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were detected by ELISA.RESULTS: After modeling, ovarian index and serum AMH levels were obviously decreased (P<0.05), and the levels of serum FSH, E2, T and DHEA were significantly increased in contrast with the control group (P<0.05). Following intervention and compared with the model group, the serum FSH and DHEA levels of each moxibustion group were significantly reduced (P<0.05), the AMH levels significantly increased and E2 and T contents significantly decreased in the moxibustion-2 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05). The serum FSH, E2 and T contents in moxibustion-2 group were obviously lower than those of the moxibustion-1 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Moxibustion pre-treatment can improve ovarian reserve function in DOR rats, while the effect is different with different intervention time, and the best intervention time is pre-occurrence and early stage of DOR. labels: #Animals#Female#Follicle Stimulating Hormone#Moxibustion#Ovarian Reserve#Ovary#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'Objective: To study common problems in BRAF gene mutation detection, and conditions for repetition testing using thyroid fine needle aspiration specimens. Methods: A total of 8 644 cases of thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens at China-Japan Friendship Hospital were collected between February, 2012 and July, 2018. BRAF gene mutation was detected by real-time PCR. Repeat testing was performed in 237 cases when the results were inconsistent with clinical or cytological diagnosis or when uncertain results were obtained. Results: The final positive rates of BRAF mutation was 22.0% (1 897/8 625). Nineteen cases were excluded due to inadequate DNA samples. The average Ct value of internal quality control was 16.061, and the average Ct value of the positive samples was 19.147. Among 237 repeat tests, 51.4% (19/37) continued to have poor DNA quality and 48.6% (18/37) had adequate DNA resulting in 1 positive case and 17 negative cases. In 40 repetition of initial negative cases, results were unchanged. In initial positive cases, 40.4% (40/99) with a difference of Ct value (between BRAF gene and internal quality control) between 8 to 12 turned negative after repetition, 69.8% (37/53) of these cases with a difference of more than 12 turned negative after repetition. The sensitivity and specificity of BRAF mutation were 83.97% and 96.94%, respectively. Conclusions: Difference between BRAF gene Ct value and internal quality control Ct value is recommended as a reliability index for the test result. Cases with a difference greater than 8 should be subjected to repeat testing. labels: #Biopsy, Fine-Needle#China#DNA Mutational Analysis#Humans#Mutation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Reproducibility of Results#Thyroid Nodule'
b'In the green algal order Volvocales (Chlorophyceae), flagellate colonial forms have evolved at least four times. One of these colonial lineages, Tetrabaenaceae-Goniaceae-Volvocaceae (TGV), which belongs to the clade Reinhardtinia, is closely related to several unicellular chlamydomonads in the genera Chlamydomonas and Vitreochlamys. However, the unicellular sister of TGV has not been specified. Here, the largest ever 18S rRNA phylogenetic tree of Reinhardtinia was constructed including several newly isolated chlamydomonads, and a clade (core-Reinhardtinia) including 32 unicellular lineages and three colonial families were recognized. Interrelationships within core-Reinhardtinia were barely resolved in the tree, and therefore combined 18S-atpB-psaA-psaB-psbC-rbcL gene phylogenetic analyses were performed with selected representatives of 29 of the 32 unicellular lineages and three colonial families. The 29 unicellular lineages were clustered into five metaclades and an unassigned lineage; the metaclade that includes Chlamydomonas pila was resolved, with moderate support, as the sister clade to TGV. To examine possible biases from specific gene(s), long-branch taxa, and the heterogeneous base composition, phylogenetic analyses using several smaller data sets were also performed. Light microscopy of C. pila and its relatives indicated that any early steps towards colony evolution appeared after divergence of TGV from the C. pila lineage. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) published the guidelines 2019 for the treatment of colorectal cancer in March 2019. The new edition expanded the indications of endoscopic treatment, enriched the follow-up recommendations after endoscopic resection of early colorectal cancer, supplemented the indications of ISR and added the recommendations of lymph node recurrence and peritoneal recurrence. In the new edition, the adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy schemes were revised and patients with first-line chemotherapy were divided into three categories as follows: appropriate for intensive systemic therapy (fit), inappropriate for intensive systemic therapy (vulnerable), and inappropriate for systemic therapy (frail). The new edition of guidelines can also provide references to the doctors of colorectal cancer in our country.

b'RATIONALE: Managing the health of vulnerable groups is an important component of health care. Given the long-term burden of radiation-release incidents among those exposed, managing the health of vulnerable groups following a nuclear disaster is very important. However, there is limited information available concerning the long-term management of the health effects of radiation exposure in vulnerable groups following nuclear disasters. After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, Minamisoma City launched internal radiation exposure monitoring program for local residents, using whole body counter (WBC) units. In 2017, a man of low socio-economic status (SES), was found to have the highest level of internal contamination detected in a person living in the Soma District in recent years. This report describes the case so that the lessons learned can be applied in future nuclear disaster settings.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old Japanese man, who had been homeless for 2 months and had been staying in the exclusion zone of Minamisoma City, was brought to our hospital. He had become homeless because a lack of communication between social support services had led to his eviction from leased housing after free housing support for evacuees was terminated.DIAGNOSES: He was admitted with a diagnosis of dehydration and malnutrition. A WBC unit was used to assess his body burden of radioactive cesium. This revealed levels of Cs-134 and Cs-137 of 538\\xe2\\x80\\x8aBq/body and 4,993\\xe2\\x80\\x8aBq/body, respectively.INTERVENTION: He received intravenous fluid therapy and health monitoring. The paperwork required for him to receive public income support was processed during hospitalization.OUTCOME: He was discharged to public housing after 9 days, and municipal workers started visiting him regularly after his discharge.LESSONS: A high level of internal radiation contamination may occur after a nuclear disaster. This may be associated with a decline in social support, poverty, and social isolation, and may have more impact on people in poor health than on the general population. It would be useful to strengthen linkages between local government and welfare service providers to increase social support for vulnerable groups requiring health care, not only following disasters, but also under normal circumstances. labels: #Aged#Fukushima Nuclear Accident#Humans#Male#Radiation Exposure#Social Class#Time Factors#Whole-Body Counting'
b'Objective: To evaluate the concordance of PD-L1 expression in various tissues using antibodies 28-8 and SP263 on their respective detection platforms. Methods: Three hundred seventy four specimens of surgical resection of pulmonary diseases in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2017 were collected. Totally 374 cases were tested for PD-L1 expression using the two antibodies, 28-8 and SP263, by respective detection platforms (Dako and Ventana). Finally, 336 cases were used for further evaluation, and the results were statistically analyzed for concordance. Results: For non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the positive rate of PD-L1 was 57.5% (177/308) using SP263, and 57.5% (177/308) using 28-8 antibody. The correlation coefficient was 0.97 (P<0.01). The positive rate of both benign lung diseases and paracancerous tissues was about 10.7% (3/28), and the positive concordance rate was 100.0%. The distribution of both antibodies was also relatively consistent. Conclusions: The expression levels of 28-8 and SP263 antibodies in NSCLC and other tissues are relatively consistent, suggesting both antibodies may be complementary and substitute for each other, which may be useful in guiding clinical management. labels: #Antibodies#B7-H1 Antigen#Biomarkers, Tumor#Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung#Humans#Immunohistochemistry#Lung Neoplasms'
b'Microalgae cultivation is a promising approach to remove ambient CO2 via photosynthesis process. This paper investigates the impact of high CO2 concentrations (6, 12, and 16%) on algae growth, CO2 biofixation, lipid and carbohydrate contents, and nutrient removal of newly isolated microalgae, Coelastrum sp. SM. In addition, the ability of microalgae to produce biodiesel at optimal condition was studied. The microalgae were cultivated in wastewater using an airlift photobioreactor. Under 12% CO2, the maximum biomass productivity and CO2 fixation rate were 0.267\\xc2\\xa0g\\xc2\\xa0L-1\\xc2\\xa0day-1 and 0.302\\xc2\\xa0g\\xc2\\xa0L-1\\xc2\\xa0h-1, respectively. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorous (TP), nitrate, and sCOD removal efficiency were 84.01, 100, 86.811, and 73.084%, respectively. Under 12% CO2 and at the same condition for cell growth, the highest lipid and carbohydrate contents were 3 7.91 and 58.45%, respectively. The composition of fatty acids methyl ester (FAME) of the microalga lipid was defined. Based on the obtained results and FAME profile, Coelastrum sp. SM was a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production and also, the organism had a great potential for CO2 biofixation, which is also more suitable than any other reported strains in other related studies. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe differential peptidomics in the hippocampal tissue in a rat model of premature white matter injury, and to investigate the mechanism of premature white matter injury.METHODS: Twenty neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally divided into a control group and a model group. Rats in the model group underwent permanent ligation of the right common carotid artery 2 days after birth, followed by 2 hours of hypoxia. For rats in the control group, the right common carotid artery was isolated, but without ligation and hypoxia. Brain tissue samples were collected from the two groups, and hippocampal tissue was isolated. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with tandem mass spectrometry was used for peptidomic profiling of hippocampal tissue, and the differentially expressed peptides between the two groups were subjected to bioinformatics analysis to assess their possible roles in neural development and function.RESULTS: A total of 4164 peptides were identified and quantified, and 262 of them were differentially expressed (absolute fold change ?2.5), including 164 upregulated peptides and 98 downregulated peptides. The numbers of differentially expressed peptides of the precursor proteins ELN, PCLO, MYO15a, MAP4, and MAP1b were the most, and may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of premature white matter injury. CDK5 signaling pathway in the hippocampus was activated in the rat model of premature white matter injury.CONCLUSIONS: The differentially expressed peptides related to precursor proteins such as MAP1b may be key bioactive peptides involved in neural development and function in premature white matter injury, and activation of the CDK5 signaling pathway may be associated with premature white matter injury. labels: #Animals#Animals, Newborn#Brain#Female#Hippocampus#Pregnancy#Premature Birth#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#White Matter'
b'Objective: To investigate the prognostic values of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) calculated from pretreatment (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET-CT results of patients with advanced extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Methods: The clinic data, follow-up data and pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET-CT data of 45 patients with ENKTL of stage ? were collected. The optimal cutoff value of progression-free survival (PFS) of SUV(max), MTV and TLG were analyzed by using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Kaplan-Meier method, Log-rank test and COX proportional hazards model were used for survival analysis, univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, respectively. Results: The median SUV(max), MTV and TLG of 45 ENKTL patients were 17.98, 70.18 and 755.42, respectively. ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SUV(max), MTV and TLG were 0.504 (P=0.970), 0.868 (P<0.001) and 0.848 (P=0.001), respectively. The value of SUV(max) was too small to fit for calculating the cutoff value of AUC. The cutoff value of MTV was 42.54 (sensitivity =78.1% and specificity =84.6%), and the cutoff value of TLG was 435.15 (sensitivity=75.0% and specificity =76.9%). Univariate analysis showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, epstein-barr virus (EBV)-DNA, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, bone marrow, Korean prognostic index (KPI), MTV, TLG were significantly related with PFS (all P<0.05), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, EBV-DNA, ECOG score, primary tumor location, KPI, MTV, TLG were significantly related with overall survival (OS) (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that KPI, MTV and TLG were independent prognostic predictors of PFS and OS (all P<0.05). Conclusions: MTV and TLG of pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET-CT are independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS of patients with advanced ENKTL. MTV and TLG may be more fit for evaluating the prognosis of ENKTL patients than SUV(max). labels: #Fluorodeoxyglucose F18#Glycolysis#Humans#Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell#Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography#Positron-Emission Tomography#Prognosis#Progression-Free Survival#Radiopharmaceuticals#Retrospective Studies#Survival Analysis#Tumor Burden'
b'Two TaqMan\\xc2\\xae qPCR assays were developed to specifically quantify the absolute abundance of Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris in mixed-species algal biofilms by targeting the psbA gene. Standard curves were developed with amplification efficiencies of 92.4% and 96.6% for S. obliquus and C. vulgaris, respectively, and an R2 value of 0.99 for both. Calibration curves for estimating absolute cell abundances resulted in slopes of 0.98 and 1.11 for C. vulgaris and S. obliquus, respectively, and an R2 value of 0.95 for both. The assays were applied to cultivated mixed-species biofilms and approximately 107 cells of each algal species were quantified when 107 cells were added into biofilms. The developed qPCR assays were concluded to be specific and accurate for the quantification of S. obliquus and C. vulgaris in mixed-species biofilms.

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) strongly influences the metabolic pathways of mixotrophic-grown microalgae, however, its role involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis is still not fully understood. In this study, integrative metabolic and physiologic profiles were analyzed in elucidating how C/N affected carbon and nitrogen assimilation and thereby exerted influence on astaxanthin biosynthesis. It was demonstrated that high C/N up-regulated the activities of acetate kinase by increase of 5.76 folds in early logarithmic phase, leading a significant increase of acetyl-CoA. The increased carbon skeletons were then funneled into astaxanthin biosynthesis. Additionally, high C/N increased the proportion of carotenoid-intermediates in cytoplasm from chloroplast. Finally, a fed-batch cultivation strategy based on C/N gradient was developed. Biomass attained 9.18\\xe2\\x80\\xafg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1 in 100% type of immotile cyst cells, which presented astaxanthin productivity at 15.45\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1\\xe2\\x80\\xafd-1 afterward, exhibiting a promising paradigm in commercial production. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The increasing use of nanoparticles (NPs) unavoidably enhances their unintended introduction into the aquatic systems, raising concerns about their nanosafety. This work aims to assess the toxicity of five oxide NPs (Al2O3, Mn3O4, In2O3, SiO2 and SnO2) using the freshwater alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata as a primary producer of ecological relevance. These NPs, in OECD medium, were poorly soluble and unstable (displayed low zeta potential values and presented the tendency to agglomerate). Using the algal growth inhibition assay and taking into account the respective 72\\xe2\\x80\\xafh-EC50 values, it was possible to categorize the NPs as: toxic (Al2O3 and SnO2); harmful (Mn3O4 and SiO2) and non-toxic/non-classified (In2O3). The toxic effects were mainly due to the NPs, except for SnO2 which toxicity can mainly be attributed to the Sn ions leached from the NPs. A mechanistic study was undertaken using different physiological endpoints (cell membrane integrity, metabolic activity, photosynthetic efficiency and intracellular ROS accumulation). It was observed that Al2O3, Mn3O4 and SiO2 induced an algistatic effect (growth inhibition without loss of membrane integrity) most likely as a consequence of the cumulative effect of adverse outcomes: i) reduction of the photosynthetic efficiency of the photosystem II (?PSII); ii) intracellular ROS accumulation and iii) loss of metabolic activity. SnO2 NPs also provoked an algistatic effect probably as a consequence of the reduction of ?PSII since no modification of intracellular ROS levels and metabolic activity were observed. Altogether, the results here presented allowed to categorize the toxicity of the five NPs and shed light on the mechanisms behind NPs toxicity in the green alga P. subcapitata. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'We aimed to investigate the correlation of homocysteine (Hcy) level with clinical characteristics, and explore its predictive value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk in female patients with premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS).The serum Hcy level was detected from 1299 female patients with premature ACS. According to the tertile of Hcy level, patients were divided into 3 groups: lowest tertile group (?9.1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L), middle tertile group (9.2-11.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L) and highest tertile group (>11.6\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc3\\xacmol/L). MACE incidence was recorded and MACE-free survival was caculated with the median follow-up duration of 28.3 months.Increased Hcy correlated with older age (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), higher creatinine level (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), and enhanced uric acid level (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001), while reduced fasting glucose concentration (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). MACE incidence was 10.7% and it was highest in highest tertile group (22.1%), followed by middle tertile group (7.7%) and lowest tertile group (2.4%) (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that Hcy distinguished MACE patients from non-MACE patients with the area under the curve of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.742-0.835). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that MACE-free survival was shortest in Hcy highest tertile group, followed by middle tertile group and lowest tertile group (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001). Multivariate Cox analyses further showed that higher Hcy level was an independent predictive factor for poor MACE-free survival (middle tertile vs lowest tertile (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001, HR: 3.615, 95% CI: 1.661-7.864); highest tertile vs lowest tertile (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.001, HR: 11.023, 95% CI: 5.356-22.684)).Hcy serves as a potential predictive factor for increased MACE risk in female patients with premature ACS. labels: #Acute Coronary Syndrome#Age Factors#Cardiovascular Diseases#Female#Homocysteine#Humans#Incidence#Middle Aged#Predictive Value of Tests#Risk Assessment'
b'Objective To investigate the function and differentiation of 1/17 type helper T (Th1/17) cells. Methods Bioinformatics analysis was performed using a gene chip dataset (GSE104021) in GEO which contains gene expression data from Th17 cells and Th1/17 cells of healthy human subjects. Taking Th17 cells as the control, R language software was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Th17 cells and Th1/17 cells, so as to explore the main functional molecules of Th1/17 cells. After that, gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis of DEGs were conducted by R language software. Finally, the genes enriched into the target biological process in the GO analysis were selected for protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis to explore the differentiation process of Th1/17 cells. Results Analysis of DEGs showed that, compared with Th17 cells, the underexpressed genes in Th1/17 cells were interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). The over-expressed genes were coiled-coil domain-containing 3 (CCDC3), C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), colony stimulating factor 2 receptor beta common subunit (CSF2RB), C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), interferon gamma (IFNG) and epithelial stromal interaction 1 (EPSTI1). In GO analysis, cell component analysis showed that the expression products of these DEGs were mainly located at external side of plasma membrane and the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor complex; biological process analysis showed that the expression products of DEGs were involved in the upregulation of interleukin 23 (IL-23), the chemokine-mediated signaling pathway and the upregulated chemotaxis of natural killer (NK) cells; molecular function analysis showed that the expression products of these DEGs had C-C motif chemokine 5 receptor (CCR5) binding activity, cytokine activity and interferon gamma (IFN-\\xc3\\xa3) receptor binding activity. The results of KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and chemokine signaling pathways. The GO analysis showed that DEGs IL-17A and IFNG were enriched to the biological process of upregulating IL-23 production. PPI showed that IL-17A and IFNG had biological functions of regulating cytokine production and myeloid white blood cell differentiation. Conclusion Bioinformatics analysis showed that the protein products encoded by overexpressed genes CCL4, CSF2RB, CCL5, IFNG and EPSTI1 in Th1/17 cells were potential functional effectors of Th1/17 cells. Th1/17 cells could produce IFN-\\xc3\\xa3 and IL-17A, which act on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) derived from myeloid white blood cells, thus promoting the differentiation of macrophages and DCs and the production of IL-23. IL-23 promotes trans-differentiation of Th17 cells into Th1/17 cells. labels: #Cell Differentiation#Computational Biology#Gene Ontology#Humans#Protein Interaction Maps#Th1 Cells#Th17 Cells'
b'The mitochondrial ATP synthase of Polytomella exhibits a peripheral stalk and a dimerization domain built by the Asa subunits, unique to chlorophycean algae. The topology of these subunits has been extensively studied. Here we explored the interactions of subunit Asa3 using Far Western blotting and subcomplex reconstitution, and found it associates with Asa1 and Asa8. We also identified the novel interactions Asa1-Asa2 and Asa1-Asa7. In silico analyses of Asa3 revealed that it adopts a HEAT repeat-like structure that points to its location within the enzyme based on the available 3D-map of the algal ATP synthase. We suggest that subunit Asa3 is instrumental in securing the attachment of the peripheral stalk to the membrane sector, thus stabilizing the dimeric mitochondrial ATP synthase. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression level of silencing information regulatory 2 (SIRT2) in cervical cancer and CIN tissues and its clinical significance.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was carried out to examine the expression of SIRT2 in 262 cases of cervical cancer tissues, 75 cases of precancerous lesions and 75 cases of normal cervical tissues, and the clinical implications of SIRT2 was further analyzed. The protein expression level of SIRT2 in 40 cervical cancer fresh tissue samples and 20 normal cervical tissue samples was detected by Western blot. shRNA-SIRT2 virus was transfected into HeLa cells to obtain the SIRT2-down-regulated HeLa cells. And the influence of down-regulation of SIRT2 on cell proliferation and migration was investigated by MTT and Scratch test.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical results showed that SIRT2 protein expression level gradually increased in cervical cancer, CIN and normal cervix tissues (P < 0.001). Western blot confirmed that SIRT2 expression level was higher in cervical cancer tissues than in normal cervix tissues (P < 0.001). The expression level of SIRT2 in cervical cancer was correlated with some factors, such as lymph node metastasis, histological type, clinical staging and HPV infection (P < 0.05). At the same time, it was independent of some factors including age, differentiation degree, pelvic metastasis, whether involving the cervical interstitial and the involvement depth and whether involving the neck junction and vaginal ends (P>0.05). Mortality in SIRT2 high expression patient group was higher than that of SIRT2 low expression patient group (P < 0.05). shRNA interference technique could effectively inhibit the expression level of SIRT2 in HeLa cells (P < 0.05). MTT assay and Scratch test indicated that down-regulation of SIRT2 expression inhibited the proliferation and migration of HeLa cells (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: SIRT2 may play a promoting role in the progress of cervical cancer, and SIRT2 may be related to the development of malignant degree of cervical cancer, and the inhibition of SIRT2 expression may be a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. labels: #Cell Proliferation#Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia#Female#Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic#HeLa Cells#Humans#Lymphatic Metastasis#Sirtuin 2#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b'RATIONALE: One-and-a-half syndrome (OAAH) is characterized as the combination of ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. OAAH syndrome accompanied with 7th and 8th cranial nerve palsy is called 16-and-a-half syndrome. We aimed to report the case of 16-and-a-half syndrome with metastatic pons tumor.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old male diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis occurring 15 months ago was referred to our clinic with the chief complaint of horizontal diplopia and right gaze palsy.DIAGNOSIS: According to the patient symptom, ocular examination, and radiographic findings, he was diagnosed as 16-and-a-half syndrome which was caused by brain tumor metastasis from NSCLC.INTERVENTIONS: We referred him to hemato-oncology department and he was treated with radiation and supportive therapy.OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the patient passed away 1 month later without improvement of ophthalmoplegia.LESSONS: The clinical findings of our case indicate 16-and-a-half syndrome caused by brain tumor metastasis from NSCLC, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. The case highlights a rare cause of OAAH spectrum disease and the importance of a systemic work-up including associated neurologic symptoms and brain imaging in patients with horizontal gaze palsy. labels: #Brain Neoplasms#Facial Nerve Diseases#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Ocular Motility Disorders#Ophthalmoplegia#Pons#Syndrome#Vestibulocochlear Nerve Diseases'
b'Microscopic green algae inhabiting desert microbiotic crusts are remarkably diverse phylogenetically, and many desert lineages have independently evolved from aquatic ancestors. Here we worked with five desert and aquatic species within the family Scenedesmaceae to examine mechanisms that underlie desiccation tolerance and release of unicellular versus multicellular progeny. Live cell staining and time-lapse confocal imaging coupled with transmission electron microscopy established that the desert and aquatic species all divide by multiple (rather than binary) fission, although progeny were unicellular in three species and multicellular (joined in a sheet-like coenobium) in two. During division, Golgi complexes were localized near nuclei, and all species exhibited dynamic rotation of the daughter cell mass within the mother cell wall at cytokinesis. Differential desiccation tolerance across the five species, assessed from photosynthetic efficiency during desiccation/rehydration cycles, was accompanied by differential accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected using a dye sensitive to intracellular ROS. Further comparative investigation will aim to understand the genetic, ultrastructural and physiological characteristics supporting unicellular versus multicellular coenobial morphology, and the ability of representatives in the Scenedesmaceae to colonize ecologically diverse, even extreme, habitats. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Acanthurus spp. of St. Kitts and other Caribbean islands, including ocean surgeonfish A. bahianus, doctorfish A. chirurgus, and blue tang A. coeruleus, frequently show multifocal cutaneous pigmentation. Initial reports from the Leeward Antilles raised suspicion of a parasitic etiology. The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of the disease in St. Kitts' Acanthuridae and describe its pathology and etiology. Visual surveys demonstrated consistently high adjusted mean prevalence at 3 shallow reefs in St. Kitts in 2017 (38.9%, 95% CI: 33.8-43.9) and 2018 (51.5%; 95% CI: 46.2-56.9). There were no differences in prevalence across species or reefs, but juvenile fish were less commonly affected than adults. A total of 29 dermatopathy-affected acanthurids were sampled by spearfishing for comprehensive postmortem examination. Digenean metacercariae were dissected from <1 mm cysts within pigmented lesions. Using partial 28S rDNA sequence data they were classified as Family Heterophyidae, members of which are commonly implicated in black spot disease of other fishes. Morphological features of the parasite were most typical of Scaphanocephalus spp. (Creplin, 1842), and 2 genetic profiles were obtained suggesting more than 1 digenean species. Histologically, pigmented lesions had mild chronic perivascular dermatitis and increased melanophores and melanin density, often centered on encysted digenean metacercariae. In 1 affected A. chirurgus, similar metacercariae were histologically identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Further research is needed to clarify impact on host fitness, establish the number of heterophyid digenean species that cause black spots on Caribbean fishes and to determine the intermediate and definitive host species. labels: #Animals#Caribbean Region#Dermatitis#Metacercariae#Perciformes#West Indies"
b'OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for detecting nicotine and cotinine in hair by hydrophilic interaction chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.METHODS: Hair samples were hydrolyzed in sodium hydroxide solution before extraction with dichloromethane. The samples were blown to dry with nitrogen and dissolved with mobile phase. The filtrate of the samples was injected into a chromatographic-mass spectrometry system for analysis. The separation was performed by a hydrophilic column, with which methanol-0.1% ammonia was used as the mobile phase. The quantitative detection of Nicotine and Cortinine was carried out with electron spray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The established method was used for detecting nicotine and cotinine in 602 hair samples of pregnant women and 31 hair and urine samples of volunteers.RESULTS: A standard curve was drawn for the established method of hydrophilic liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Good linearity was obtained for detecting nicotine and cotinine in the range of 0.030-100.000 \\xc3\\xacg/L, with a detection limit (MDL) of 0.007 6 \\xc3\\xacg/g and 0.004 4 \\xc3\\xacg/g, respectively. The inter-day and intra-day precisions reached a level of less than 10%. The recoveries of the spiked samples ranged from 81.0% to 102.0%. About 0.020-0.260 \\xc3\\xacg/g nicotine and 0.004 8-0.069 0 \\xc3\\xacg/g cotinine were detected in the pregnant women without exposure to secondhand smoking (SHS), compared with 0.029-0.350 \\xc3\\xacg/g nicotine and 0.005 6-0.085 0 \\xc3\\xacg/g cotinine in those exposed to SHS. Nicotine and cotinine were also found in the hair and urine samples of volunteers, which were correlated with smoking (P < 0.05). A dose-response relationship were found between smoking and hair nicotine.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is accurate and sensitive for detecting nicotine and cotinine in hair samples. Hair nicotine can be a specific biomarker for assessing exposure to tobacco smoking. labels: #Biomarkers#Chromatography, Liquid#Cotinine#Female#Hair#Humans#Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions#Nicotine#Pregnancy#Tandem Mass Spectrometry#Tobacco Smoke Pollution'
b'Scar contracture after burn on the back of hand can easily lead to the limitation of flexion function of fingers, which seriously affects daily life activities. Generally, comprehensive rehabilitation treatment is adopted for scar contracture on the back of hand, among which wearing braces is an effective treatment method. However, some braces will limit the normal finger joints or must wait until all the affected fingers heal before they can be worn, and the wearing operation is quite complicated. In order to solve these problems, the author designed and made a finger flexion band, which was used to stretch the patients with limited flexion of finger caused by scar contracture after burn on the back of hand, and achieved good therapeutic effect. According to the measured hand size, the finger flexion band is cut and spliced from the fabric commonly used in daily life. The finger flexion band is designed with finger sleeve, which will not limit the normal finger joints, can interfere with the healed finger in advance, fix the corresponding fingers better, and improve the treatment comfort, especially for children who do not cooperate with the braces wearing. This finger flexion band is simple to make, cheap, convenient to use, and suitable for clinical promotion. labels: #Burns#Cicatrix#Contracture#Fingers#Hand Injuries#Humans#Orthotic Devices'
b"Size determines the rate at which organisms acquire and use resources but it is unclear what size should be favoured under unpredictable resource regimes. Some theories claim smaller organisms can grow faster following a resource pulse, whereas others argue larger species can accumulate more resources and maintain growth for longer periods between resource pulses. Testing these theories has relied on interspecific comparisons, which tend to confound body size with other life-history traits. As a more direct approach, we used 280 generations of artificial selection to evolve a 10-fold difference in mean body size between small- and large-selected phytoplankton lineages of Dunaliella tertiolecta, while controlling for biotic and abiotic variables. We then quantified how body size affected the ability of this species to grow at nutrient-replete conditions and following periods of nitrogen or phosphorous deprivation. Overall, smaller cells showed slower growth, lower storage capacity and poorer recovery from phosphorous depletion, as predicted by the 'fasting endurance hypothesis'. However, recovery from nitrogen limitation was independent of size-a finding unanticipated by current theories. Phytoplankton species are responsible for much of the global carbon fixation and projected trends of cell size decline could reduce primary productivity by lowering the ability of a cell to store resources. labels: #Chlorophyceae"

b'Objective: To assess the technical success rate, stent patency, clinical efficacy and complications of stent placement for filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out for 12 patients with filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava associated with severe post-thrombotic syndrome, who underwent stent placement after ineffective conservative therapy at Nanjing First Hospital from March 2016 to December 2018,9 males and 3 females, aged from 48 to 77 years, mean age 60 years, six had bilateral lower extremity symptoms and six had unilateral lower extremity symptoms.Technical success rate, stent patency, clinical efficacy and complications of stent placement were recorded. Clinical success was defined as relief of symptoms and a decrease in clinical, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology (CEAP) score for at least grade 1. Results: Stent placement in the unilateral or bilateral iliocaval occlusion was successful in 11 patients. The cause of technical failure in the single patient with failed stent placement was an inability to cross the occluded left iliacvein and the patient was treated with stent placement in the right iliocaval vein.There were 7 patients with inferior vena cava and unilateral iliocaval stent placement; 5 patients with inferior vena cava and bilateral iliocaval stent placement. Acute stent thrombosis occlusion occurred in 1 case after the operation, the blood flow recanalized after catheter-directed thrombolysis and re-stenting. All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months, with an average of (13\\xc2\\xb16) months. During the follow-up period, CTV or venography of lower limbs showed that the blood flow in the stent was unobstructed. At the last follow-up, 12 patients were evaluated as clinically effective. Three patients had transient treatment of lateral lumbar pain during operation, which alleviated by themselves.No significant abdominal pain, severe hemorrhage, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and other complications related to treatment occurred in all patients during perioperative period and follow-up. Conclusion: Stent placement is safe and feasible in the treatment of filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava, which can alleviate the clinical symptoms of severe post-thrombotic syndrome. labels: #Aged#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Stents#Treatment Outcome#Vascular Patency#Vena Cava Filters#Vena Cava, Inferior#Venous Thrombosis'
b'OBJECTIVES: We analyzed primary school performance of girls with Turner syndrome (TS) in two distinct countries to ascertain if the cognitive phenotype of TS causes selective learning difficulties.METHODS: The cohort comprised of 44 Czech and 50 Egyptian girls with TS who attended public schools. School reports from grades 1 to 9 were obtained retrospectively from Czech participants with TS. Only recent school reports were obtained from Egyptian participants. Two controls per participant were requested - biological sisters and/or female classmates. The results were converted into a 5-point scale (1-excellent; 5-unsatisfactory).RESULTS: Analysis of longitudinal Czech data displayed a strong time component in both subjects and controls. Showing better points in lower grades with its gradual worsening as the education complexity increased. In contrast, there was a strong statistically significant difference between groups in Mathematics (p=0.0041, p=0.0205 after Bonferroni correction) and this difference increased over time. The points for Mathematics did not differ in grades 1+2 (0.05 difference in mean grade between the two groups), however, they differed by 0.28 in grades 6+7 and by 0.32 in grades 8+9. While slightly different in character (cross-sectional vs. longitudinal), the Egyptian cohort data confirmed our findings, showing no difference in general school performance but having similar trends in Mathematics (grades 1+2: 0.11, grades 6+7: 0.54, grades 8+9: 0.68; p=0.0058, p=0.029 after Bonferroni correction).CONCLUSION: Excluding results in Mathematics, which showed pronounced worsening in relation to age in comparison with unaffected controls, girls with TS performed similarly to their controls. labels: #Adolescent#Child#Cohort Studies#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Mathematics#Retrospective Studies#Turner Syndrome'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Large Intestine of Hand-Yangming, Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming and the Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, so as to explore the positive reaction points at the body surface of allergic rhinitis.METHODS: Thirty variant rhinitis volunteer subjects and 30 healthy subjects were recruited in the present study. The subcutaneous induration, reaction points of emptiness-like feeling or pressing pain below the elbow- and knee-joints along the Large Intestine Meridian, Stomach Meridian and the Lung Meridian were inspected first, then re-examined by using heat-sensitized moxibustion method and a hand-held pain threshold tester (mechanical pressure), respectively. The frequency and coincidence rate of pressing-pain sensitive and heat-sensitive points were analyzed.RESULTS: In the 30 patients with allergic rhinitis, 10 positive reaction points as Kongzui (LU6), Chize (LU5), Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Shousanli(LI10), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Fenglong (ST40), Xiajuxu (ST39), and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian were found. Among them, the duration of heat-sensitive reaction in the LU6, LI10, ST37, ST40, and ST39 regions was obviously shorter in patients than in healthy subjects (P<0.01,P<0.005). The heat-sensitive forms of the positive reaction points were mainly heat transmission, heat-penetration and local reaction. The mechanical pain thresholds of the positive reaction points (LI4, LU6, LI10, LI11 and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian) at the upper limbs and those (ST36, ST37 and ST40) at the lower limbs were evidently lower in patients than in healthy volunteer subjects (P<0.05). The pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints were basically coincide in the patients, but being higher in patients than in healthy subjects in the frequency of occurrence. The mechanical pain threshold of the pressure-sensitive acupoints in patients was remarkably lower on the left side than on the right side of the upper limb, and obviously higher on the left side than on the right side of the lower limb (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the right and left sides in the pain threshold in healthy subjects (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: There is a high overlap in the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Lung, Large Intestine and Stomach meridians below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, and there is an imbalance between the left and right limbs in the mechanical pain threshold of the pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints, but needing being further confirmed. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Hot Temperature#Humans#Meridians#Moxibustion#Rhinitis, Allergic'
b'Southern right whales Eubalaena australis (SRWs) migrate to southern Brazil for breeding and calving from June through November. Overall, there is scarce knowledge on health status and pathologic conditions in SRWs. We report the pathologic and molecular investigation results of 8 SRWs that were necropsied between 2010 and 2017 within a breeding and calving ground in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The animals were of various ages (7 newborns/calves, 1 adult) and sex (3 females, 5 males). Five whales stranded dead; 3 stranded alive and died shortly after (n = 2) or were euthanized (n = 1). The causes of stranding and/or death were neonatal respiratory distress syndrome with meconium aspiration (n = 3) with concomitant congenital hepatopathy in one of them; trauma of unknown origin (n = 3), infectious renal and lung disease with presumed sepsis (n = 1), and euthanasia (n = 1). Three animals were PCR-positive for cetacean morbillivirus; one of them also had morbilliviral antigen in kidney via immunohistochemical analysis. These results, integrating novel findings and a published report, contribute to the pathology knowledge of this species. labels: #Animals#Brazil#Cause of Death#Communicable Diseases#Female#Male#Meconium Aspiration Syndrome#Whales'
b'PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of immediate versus conventional delayed loading of four dental implants in edentulous mandibles with fixed prostheses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A blinded, two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial was conducted. A total of 42 patients were included, and each received four Br?nemark System implants with a TiUnite surface. The patients were randomly assigned to two study arms: 1) immediate-loading arm (IL), in which the mandibular denture was converted into an interim implant-supported fixed prosthesis (ISFP) on the day of surgery, with a permanent ISFP being inserted at least 3 months postsurgery; 2) conventional-loading arm (CL), in which the mandibular removable prosthesis was relieved at the implant site and relined with a soft tissue conditioner. Only implants with a minimum insertion torque of ? 35 Ncm were included in the IL group. Implants were loaded 4 to 6 months postsurgery. Independent, blind investigators assessed the patients at 2, 6 and 12 months and at 10 years. The outcome measures were prosthesis and implant success rates, type and frequency of complications and changes in peri-implant marginal bone levels.RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were allocated to the IL group and 22 to the CL group. However, one patient from the IL arm was excluded and three patients were reallocated to the CL arm. Two implants in one patient and one in another patient could not be placed with a ? 35 Ncm insertion torque, and a third patient developed severe sudden gag reflex and thus it was not possible to load the implants immediately. At a later stage, one of the patients who failed the initial stability test dropped out of the study. Therefore, initially, 24 patients were conventionally loaded and 16 patients were immediately loaded. At the 10-year follow-up, six patients dropped out from the IL arm and two from the CL arm. Also, at the 10-year-follow-up, the CL and IL study arms consisted of 22 and 10 participants, respectively, using the per-protocol (PP) analysis. Six implants failed in two patients of the CL arm (two implants in one patient and four implants in another patient), and three implants failed in three patients in the IL arm (PP analysis), respectively. The patient-level implant failure rate was 10% (intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis) and 14% (PP analysis) in the CL arm, and 25% (ITT) and 20% (PP) in the IL arm. The difference was not statistically significant (95% CI from -0.18 to 0.39, P = 0.65). The failure rate at the implant level was 8% (ITT) and 8% (PP) in the CL arm, and 6% (ITT) and 5% (PP) in the IL arm. The difference was not statistically significant (95% CI from -0.06 to 0.14, P = 0.44). Ten years after loading, patients in the IL arm lost an average of 0.55 \\xc2\\xb1 0.64 mm of peri-implant bone versus 0.41 \\xc2\\xb1 0.40 mm of peri-implant bone loss observed in the CL arm. The 10-year bone loss in both arms was statistically significant compared with the baseline (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two arms for peri-implant bone level changes (the difference between the arms was 0.14 mm \\xc2\\xb1 0.50 mm; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.52; P = 0.43). One prosthesis failed due to the loss of all four implants in one patient of the CL arm. Eight patients from the IL arm were affected by 13 complications (such as pain from fractures and inflammation) versus seven patients (10 complications) from the CL arm. The complication rate was 67% in the IL arm and 35% in the CL arm. The difference in complication proportions between the two arms was not statistically significant (difference in proportions = 0.32; 95% CI = -0.08 to 0.61; P = 0.14). All complications were managed successfully.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term data of immediate loading of four dental implants with a mandibular fixed prosthesis revealed comparable clinical outcomes to conventional loading. Therefore, immediate loading should be considered in the treatment of edentulous patients. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Humans#Immediate Dental Implant Loading#Mandible'
b'Objective: To investigate the characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) of cervix, and improve the diagnostic accuracy of MDA. Methods: The imaging data of eight cases of MDA was retrospectively collected, including tumor size, tumor location, tumor components, signal characteristics, enhancement characteristics and invasive extent. Results: The maximum diameter of tumor was (4.36\\xc2\\xb11.46) cm. Six tumors were mixed solid and cystic and two were predominantly solid. Six were diffusion limited on diffusion-weighted imaging, and two were not diffusion limited. On multi-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced scan, the enhancement curve of solid components of the tumor showed a plateau-like pattern in three cases and a slow-rising pattern in five cases. Tumors were confined to the cervical canal in three cases, infiltrated to cervical stroma > 1/2 depth in seven cases, and ? 1/2 depth in one case. There were four cases of uterine invasion, four cases of vaginal fornix invasion, four cases of bilateral ovarian metastasis and one case of lymph node metastasis. Conclusions: Patients suffering from large amount of vaginal discharge had cervical lesions on MRI showing polycystic and solid component enhancement should be alert to MDA. Deep-seated cervical biopsy and even conization is conducive to early diagnosis, treatment and improvement of prognosis. labels: #Adenocarcinoma#Cervix Uteri#Female#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Retrospective Studies#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b'Heart Failure in Africa Abstract. In Africa, mortality due to heart failure is twice as high as in other low- to middle-income countries and five times as high as in high-income countries. Arterial hypertension is by far the most common cause of heart failure, followed by cardiomyopathies and rheumatic heart diseases. At diagnosis, most patients suffer already from an advanced disease stage. Only a few patients are aware of arterial hypertension, and few are treated and have their hypertension well controlled. Only a minority of patients have a well-controlled hypertension. The neglect of chronic non-communicable diseases on the health agenda leads to poor awareness, poor diagnostic resources, preventions strategies and treatment options. International guidelines cannot be properly followed in these circumstances. Information at community level and in healthcare facilities is urgently needed as well as training of healthcare staff, implementation of improved diagnostics and treatment of arterial hypertension and heart failure. labels: #Africa#Cardiomyopathies#Heart Failure#Humans#Hypertension#Rheumatic Heart Disease'
b'This retrospective study investigated the effect of the novel bone graft transverse process strut (TPS) in single segmental thoracic spinal tuberculosis (TB) with the one-stage posterior approach of debridement, fusion, and internal instrumentation. Thirty patients treated in our department from March 2014 to October 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Surgical time, blood loss, hospitalization time, drainage volume, and follow-up (FU) duration were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, segmental angle, and bone fusion were compared between preoperative and final FU. All the patients were followed for a mean 50.10\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a25.10 months; the mean age, surgical time in minutes, blood loss, hospitalization time, and drainage volume were 46.23\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a17.20 years, 195.08\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a24.0\\xe2\\x80\\x8aminutes, 280.77\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a189.90\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, 17.31\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a4.23 days, 436.92\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a193.81\\xe2\\x80\\x8amL, respectively. VAS and ODI scores were significantly improved at the final FU. The ESR and CRP returned to normal. All patients achieved bony fusion with a mean time of 5.85\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.82 months and a mean segmental angle of 18.77\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.49\\xc2\\xb0 preoperatively, which significantly decreased to 9.31\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a1.54\\xc2\\xb0 at the final FU (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a<\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05). No complications, such as bone graft failure, pleural effusion, fistula, or wound infection were recorded except for cerebrospinal fluid leakage (one case), water electrolyte imbalance (5 cases), superficial infection (1 case), and mild intestinal obstruction (1 case). TPS as a bone graft is reliable, safe, and effective for segmental stability reconstruction for surgical management of single-segment thoracic spinal TB. labels: #Debridement#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Prostheses and Implants#Retrospective Studies#Thoracic Vertebrae#Tuberculosis, Spinal'
b'The effects of rhamnolipids (RLs) produced and further purified from Burkholderia thailandensis, on the unicellular microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta were investigated, in terms of RLs ability to affect algal growth, photosynthetic apparatus structure and energy flux, round and through photosystems II and I. Specifically, 24-48\\xe2\\x80\\xafh RLs-treated algae (RLs at concentrations ranged from 5 to 50\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1) showed significantly decreased levels of growth rate, while increased levels of Chl a and b were obtained only in 72-96\\xe2\\x80\\xafh RLs-treated algae. Similarly, although no changes were obtained in the Chl a/b ratio and almost all chlorophyll fluorescence parameters over time, yields of electron transport (?R0, ?E0) and respective performance index (PItotal) were negatively affected at 72 and 96\\xe2\\x80\\xafh. Based on those findings, it seems that the inhibitory effect of RLs on the algae growth rate after 24 and 48\\xe2\\x80\\xafh and the gradual attenuation of the phenomenon (after 72\\xe2\\x80\\xafh of exposure), may indicate the initial response of the organism, as well as algae ability to overcome, since RLs showed no effects on algae photosynthetic ability. Those findings reveal for the first time that RLs from Burkholderia thailandensis are not harmful for Dunaliella tertiolecta. However, further studies with the use of more aquatic species could be essential for assessing the RLs-mediated effects on aquatic biota. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"With the change of disease spectrum and the progress in the aging of society, chronic wound has gradually become one of the major diseases that threaten human health, and also one of the major economic burdens of family and society. According to the different etiology, the pathogenesis of chronic wound is different, including both systemic factors and local factors. The treatment of chronic wound is a multi-disciplinary integrated treatment process, including internal medicine treatment, surgical treatment, vascular interventional therapy, platelet-rich plasma treatment, and biological therapy, etc. Each treatment regimen has its own indications and pros and cons. To make a treatment regimen, a combination of a variety of options should be chosen according to the patient's wound conditions. The traditional chronic wound treatment mode is multi-disciplinary team (MDT) treatment mode, which requires the participation of surgeons from multiple departments such as intervention department, plastic surgery department, orthopedics department, etc., and it is also the mainstream mode for treating chronic wound in western countries. According to the domestic medical situation and the experience of our department, we put forward the integrated surgical wound treatment (ISWT) mode, that is to integrate multiple surgical techniques of wound treatment. Compared with the traditional MDT treatment mode, to apply the ISWT mode can make a more reasonable treatment plan, improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment, shorten the hospitalization period, and improve the diagnosis and treatment ability of the team. With the increasing incidence of chronic wound, the ISWT mode needs to be further explored and improved, and the team needs more specialized experts to join in. labels: #Humans#Surgical Wound"
b'Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are amalgamations of autotrophic, heterotrophic and saprotrophic organisms. In the Polar Regions, these unique communities occupy essential ecological functions such as primary production, nitrogen fixation and ecosystem engineering. Here, we present the first molecular survey of BSCs from the Arctic and Antarctica focused on both eukaryotes and prokaryotes as well as passive and active biodiversity. Considering sequence abundance, Bryophyta is among the most abundant taxa in all analyzed BSCs suggesting that they were in a late successional stage. In terms of algal and cyanobacterial biodiversity, the genera Chloromonas, Coccomyxa, Elliptochloris and Nostoc were identified in all samples regardless of origin confirming their ubiquitous distribution. For the first time, we found the chrysophyte Spumella to be common in polar BSCs as it was present in all analyzed samples. Co-occurrence analysis revealed the presence of sulfur metabolizing microbes indicating that BSCs also play an important role for the sulfur cycle. In general, phototrophs were most abundant within the BSCs but there was also a diverse community of heterotrophs and saprotrophs. Our results show that BSCs are unique microecosystems in polar environments with an unexpectedly high biodiversity. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: To explore the development trajectories of quality of life and acceptance of disability of burn patients in the rehabilitation treatment stage and the influencing factors. Methods: Totally 207 burn patients, including 157 males and 50 females, aged (40\\xc2\\xb113) years, who were in the rehabilitation treatment stage were selected by convenient sampling method from October 2016 to July 2017 in the Department of Burns of Fujian Medical University Union Hospital for this longitudinal study. At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the patient's quality of life and acceptance of disability were scored using the Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief and Chinese Version of Acceptance of Disability Scale-Revised respectively. Taking the intercept, the slope, and the curve slope as latent variables, the latent second growth curve model was constructed for the quality of life and the acceptance of disability. The robust maximum likelihood estimation (MLR) method was used to estimate the mean, the variance, and the covariance, so as to analyze the discharge level, the growth rate, the acceleration, and the correlation among them. Taking the acceptance of disability, the gender, the cause of burn, the severity of burn, the existence of complications, the payment way, and the education level as covariates, the latent second growth curve model was constructed for the quality of life. The MLR method was used to estimate the influence of covariates on the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of the quality of life. Results: At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the quality of life scores of patients were (102\\xc2\\xb136), (111\\xc2\\xb136), (118\\xc2\\xb137), and (122\\xc2\\xb137) points respectively, and the acceptance of disability scores were (73\\xc2\\xb117), (75\\xc2\\xb117), (77\\xc2\\xb117), and (78\\xc2\\xb118) points respectively. The estimated mean intercept of the quality of life and the acceptance of disability were 101.680 and 72.993 respectively at discharge, both of which showed a curve increasing trend in 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge (estimated mean slope=11.024, 3.086, t=15.376, 7.476, P<0.01), and the increasing rate (acceleration) gradually slowed down (estimated mean curve slope=-1.393, -0.426, t=-13.339, -4.776, P<0.01). There were significant individual differences in the discharge level and the acceleration of quality of life of patients (estimated intercept variance=1 174.527, t=9.332; estimated curve slope variance=2.379, t=6.402; P<0.01). There were significant individual differences in the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of patients' acceptance of disability (estimated intercept variance=267.017, t=9.262; estimated slope variance=32.264, t=2.356; estimated curve slope variance=0.882, t=2.939; P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was no significant correlation among the discharge level, the growth rate, and the acceleration of the quality of life and those of the acceptance of disability of patients (estimated intercept and slope=37.273, -1.457, t=0.859, -0.131; estimated intercept and curve slope=-6.712, -0.573, t=-1.089, -0.248; estimated slope and curve slope=-5.494, -5.988, t=-0.930, -2.512; P>0.05). Among the time-constant covariates, only the severity of burn and the presence of complications had a significant impact on the quality of life of patients at discharge (estimated intercept=-10.721, 5.522, t=-6.229, 1.977, P<0.05 or P<0.01). At discharge and 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge, the level of acceptance of disability had a positive impact on the quality of life of patients (standardized regression coefficient=0.616, 0.669, 0.681, 0.678, t=18.874, 21.660, 22.824, 22.123, P<0.01). Conclusions: The initial levels of quality of life and acceptance of disability of burn patients in the rehabilitation treatment stage are relatively low, both with a curve increasing trend over time, and the increasing rate gradually slows down. Patients with complications and serious burns have poor quality of life at discharge, while the acceptance of disability has a positive impact on the quality of life. labels: #Adaptation, Psychological#Adult#Burns#Disabled Persons#Female#Humans#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Middle Aged#Quality of Life"
b'Endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare entity in the pediatric population. Patients usually present with height deceleration and continuous weight gain, along with other classic stigmata of CS, such as acne, striae, hirsutism and others. The diagnosis of CS involves documentation of abnormal cortisol secretion with measurement of urinary free cortisol and midnight serum or salivary cortisol, and the use of the 1mg dexamethasone suppression test. After confirmation of CS, localization of the source of hypercortisolemia, involves differentiation of ACTH-dependent versus ACTH-independent causes of CS. Surgical resection of the identified source of CS is the preferred method of treatment whenever possible. labels: #Child#Cushing Syndrome#Humans#Hydrocortisone'
b'\\n             Sub-Saharan Africa is home of 85 % of pregnant women living with HIV and 90 % of HIV-infected children. WHO issued the first prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) recommendations in 2000. These guidelines have been revised to incorporate new evidence and align with the goal of universal treatment access and zero infections among children. Currently, 82 % of HIV-infected pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment, and infections among children have halved since 2010. However, in 2018, 160,000 children became infected. Reasons hindering the success of PMTCT are: a) non-universal HIV testing during pregnancy; b) low retention through the PMTCT cascade; and c) missed opportunities to diagnose women who acquire HIV while pregnant or breastfeeding. To address these gaps innovative strategies are needed.\\n           labels: #Anti-HIV Agents#Child#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical#Mass Screening#Pregnancy#Pregnancy Complications, Infectious'
b'Objective: To investigate the detection rate of pulmonary nodules and the accuracy of automated measurement in chest simulation phantom by artificial intelligent computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules with different pre-adaptive iterative techniques (ASIR-V) in wide-spectrum CT scanning. Methods: Sixteen pulmonary nodules with different diameters, densities and shapes were placed in the chest simulation phantom from December 2017 to March 2018. The weight of ASIR-V was set at 0%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% respectively by using Revolution CT broadband energy spectrum scanning protocol. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the dose volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) of each group. Scanning data were imported into Tuma Shenwei artificial pulmonary nodule analysis software to evaluate the nature of the detected nodules, and ICC was used to detect the differences among groups. Results: With the increase of ASIR-V weight, the effective dose of patients decreased gradually. CTDIvol of five groups of radiation dose volume CT dose index was 7.93, 7.24, 5.85, 5.15, 3.76 mGy,dose-length product DLP was 379, 346, 280, 246, 179 mGy\\xc2\\xb7cm.There was a linear negative correlation between ASIR-V weights and CTDIvol as well as DLP, r value was-0.969, P<0.01.There was no significant difference in the detection rate of pulmonary nodules between AI and physicians (P>0.05). There was high intraclass correlation coefficients for the diameter, volume, CT value and malignant percentage of pulmonary nodules (ICCs:0.981-1.000). Conclusions: Radiation dose of unenhanced chest CT scan using wide detector spectral imaging decreased with the increasing of preset ASIR-V. Lung nodule detection rate and evaluation performance can be maintained well by using ASIR-V reconstructions at lower radiation dosage. labels: #Algorithms#Artificial Intelligence#Humans#Lung#Phantoms, Imaging#Radiation Dosage#Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted'
b'The enactment of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) initiated scientific efforts to develop reliable methods for comparing prevailing lake conditions against reference (or nonimpaired) states, using the state of a set biological elements. Drawing a distinction between impaired and natural conditions can be a challenging exercise. Another important aspect is to ensure that water quality assessment is comparable among the different Member States. In this context, the present paper offers a constructive critique of the practices followed during the WFD implementation in Greece by pinpointing methodological weaknesses and knowledge gaps that undermine our ability to classify the ecological quality of Greek lakes. One of the pillars of WDF is a valid lake typology that sets ecological standards transcending geographic regions and national boundaries. The national typology of Greek lakes has failed to take into account essential components. WFD compliance assessments based on the descriptions of phytoplankton communities are oversimplified and as such should be revisited. Exclusion of most chroococcal species from the analysis of cyanobacteria biovolume in Greek lakes/reservoirs and most reservoirs in Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus is not consistent with the distribution of those taxa in lakes. Similarly, the total biovolume reference values and the indices used in classification schemes reflect misunderstandings of WFD core principles. This hampers the comparability of ecological status across Europe and leads to quality standards that are too relaxed to provide an efficient target for the protection of Greek/transboundary lakes such as the ancient Lake Megali Prespa. labels: #Environmental Monitoring#Europe#Greece#Lakes#Mediterranean Region#Phytoplankton#Portugal#Spain#Water'
b"Objective: To investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic remedial surgery in patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer after endoscopic resection. Methods: The clinical and follow-up data of 12 patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer and then underwent endoscopic resection was collected. The clinicalpathological features and remedial indications were analyzed to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic remedial surgery. Results: The average number of lymph nodes in the lymph node dissection was 15 during remedial surgery, and 3 of them had lymph node metastasis. Among the 3 patients with residual cancer, two cases were poorly differentiated, 1 case was moderately differentiated, 1 case was positive for basal margin, and 1 case had vascular invasion. No lymph node metastasis occurred in the 9 patients who had no residual cancer. Among these, 8 cases were moderately differentiated, 1 case was poorly differentiated and 2 cases had positive basal margin. The average follow-up duration was 40 months and all 12 patients were in a state of survival at the last follow-up. During the follow-up of the 3 patients with residual cancer, 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with unknown prognosis; 1 patient received postoperative adjuvant radiochemotherapy, and lung metastasis occurred; 1 patient did not receive any treatment after surgery and survived for 33 months. Conclusions: Laparoscopic remedial surgery is a safe and feasible remedy for patients who didn't reach the cure criterion of early colorectal cancer after endoscopic resection. However, the choice of remedial strategy for colorectal carcinoma needs further investigation for patients with no vascular invasion, high degree of differentiation, and negative basal margin. labels: #Colorectal Neoplasms#Humans#Laparoscopy#Lymph Node Excision#Lymphatic Metastasis#Prognosis#Reoperation#Treatment Outcome"
b'The glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) gene family plays a major role in glycerol synthesis and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Few studies on GPD family genes from the halotolerant algae Dunaliella salina are available. In this study, seven DsaGPD genes were identified by mining D. salina sequencing data. Among them, DsaGPD5 contained the canonical NAD+-GPD protein domain, called si-GPD. In comparison, DsaGPD1-4 not only contained the canonical NAD+-GPD domain but also a unique domain, the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like superfamily domain, in their N-terminal region, called bi-GPD. DsaGPD6, 7 contained the FAD+-GPD domain. In the transient expression system, DsaGPD1, 3, 4 were found in the cytosol of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast, DsaGPD2, 5 in the chloroplast, and DsaGPD6, 7 in the mitochondria. MEME analysis showed that six conserved motifs were present in both si-GPDs and bi-GPDs, whereas seven highly conserved motifs were only present in bi-GPDs. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed significant induction of the DsaGPD genes under abiotic stresses, indicating their tolerance-related role in D. salina. DsaGPD2 and DsaGPD5 may be the osmoregulator form and glyceride form in the chloroplast, respectively. The evolutionary forces acting on si-GPDs and bi-GPDs were different in the same organism: bi-GPDs were under purifying selection, while si-GPDs were mainly under positive selection. Furthermore, evolution of the N_HAD domain and C_GPD domain in bi-GPDs is highly correlated. In summary, this study characterizes DsaGPD gene family members and provides useful information for elucidating the salt tolerance mechanism in D. salina. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The performance of a self-flocculating microalga Chlorococcum sp. GD on the flocculation, growth, and lipid accumulation in wastewater with different ammonia nitrogen concentrations was investigated. It was revealed that relative high ammonia nitrogen concentration (20-50 mg\\xc2\\xb7L-1) was beneficial to the flocculation of Chlorococcum sp. GD, and the highest flocculating efficiency was up to 84.4%. It was also found that the highest flocculating efficiency occurred in the middle of the culture (4-5 days) regardless of initial ammonia concentration in wastewater. It was speculated that high flocculating efficiency was likely related to the production of extracellular proteins. 20 mg\\xc2\\xb7L-1 of ammonia was found to be a preferred concentration for both biomass production and lipid accumulation. 92.8% COD, 98.8% ammonia, and 69.4% phosphorus were removed when Chlorococcum sp. GD was cultivated in wastewater with 20 mg\\xc2\\xb7L-1 ammonia. The novelty and significance of the investigation was the integration of flocculation, biomass production, wastewater treatment, and lipid accumulation, simultaneously, which made Chlorococcum sp. GD a potential candidate for wastewater treatment and biodiesel production if harvested in wastewater with suitable ammonia nitrogen concentration. labels: #Chlorophyceae'

More and more applications are developed in the medical field, either for medical education or as knowledge resources to help physicians guide their treatment, and have been regrouped under the name of mobile-learning or m-learning. Because of an increasing demand of students from the Faculty of Medicine in Geneva University, we developed a smartphone and tablet application, called Head To Toe, which is a mobile medical knowledge distribution platform. After successful implementation for students, the platform is now extending to postgraduate formation and to hospital physicians.

b'Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is the important precursors for triacylglycerol synthesis, while glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) determines the formation of G3P. In this study, two GDPH genes, Dtgdp1 and Dtgdp2 were isolated and identified from Dunaliella tertiolecta. The full-length Dtgdp1 and Dtgdp2 CDS were 2016 bp and 2094 bp, which encoded two putative protein sequences of 671 and 697 amino acids with predicted molecular weights of 73.64\\xe2\\x80\\x89kDa and 76.73\\xe2\\x80\\x89kDa, respectively. DtGDP1 and DtGDP2 both had a close relationship with those of algal and higher plants. DtGDP1 shared two conserved superfamily (A1 and A2) and four signature motifs (I-IV), and the DtGDP2 showed six signature domains (from motif I to VI) and DAO_C conserved family. Our previous work showed that the triethylamine intervention could greatly increase the triacylglycerol content (up to 80%) of D. tertiolecta. This study aims to investigate the effect of triethylamine on GPDH expression. Results showed that, when treated by triethylamine at 100\\xe2\\x80\\x89ppm and 150\\xe2\\x80\\x89ppm, the expression levels of Dtgdp1 and Dtgpd2 were increased to 5.121- and 56.964-fold compared with the control, respectively. Triethylamine seemed to enhance lipid metabolic flow by inducing the expressions of Dtgdp1 and Dtgdp2 to increase the lipid content, which provides a new insight into the desired pathway of lipid synthesis in algae through genetic engineering. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: To investigate the diagnosis and treatment for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) in China, and to explore the prognostic factors of ECF. Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted based on the Registration System of Chinese Gastrointestinal Fistula and Intra-Abdominal Infections to collect the clinical data of ECF patients from 54 medical centers in 22 provinces/municipalities from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The clinical data included patient gender, age, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, underlying diseases, primary diseases, direct causes of ECF, location and type of ECF, complications, treatment and outcomes. All medical records were carefully filled in by the attending physicians, and then re-examined by more than two specialists. The diagnosis of ECF was based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory/imaging findings and intraoperative exploration. Results: A total of 1521 patients with ECF were enrolled, including 1099 males and 422 females, with a median age of 55 years. The top three primary diseases of ECF were malignant tumors in 626 cases (41.2%, including 540 gastrointestinal tumors, accounting for 86.3% of malignant tumors), gastrointestinal ulcers and perforations in 202 cases (13.3%), and trauma in 157 cases (10.3%). The direct causes of ECF were mainly surgical operation in 1194 cases (78.5%), followed by trauma in 156 (10.3%), spontaneous fistula due to Crohn's disease in 92 (6.0%), radiation intestinal injury in 41 (2.7%), severe pancreatitis in 20 (1.3%), endoscopic treatment in 13 (0.9%) and 5 cases (0.3%) of unknown reasons. All the patients were divided into three groups: 1350 cases (88.7%) with simple ECF, 150 (9.9%) with multiple ECF, and 21 (1.4%) with combined internal fistula. Among the patients with simple ECF, 438 cases (28.8%) were jejuno-ileal fistula, 313 (20.6%) colon fistula, 170 (11.2%) rectal fistula, 111 (7.3%) duodenal fistula, 76 (5.0%) ileocecal fistula, 65 (4.3%) ileocolic anastomotic fistula, 55 (3.6%) duodenal stump fistula, 36 (2.4%) gastrointestinal anastomotic fistula, 36 (2.4%) esophagogastric/esophagojejunal anastomotic fistula, 29 (1.9%) gastric fistula and 21 (1.4%) cholangiopancreatiointestinal. Among all the simple ECF patients, 991 were tubular fistula and 359 were labial fistula. A total of 1146 patients finished the treatment, of whom 1061 (92.6%) were healed (586 by surgery and 475 self-healing) and 85 (7.4%) died. A total of 1043 patients (91.0%) received nutritional support therapy, and 77 (6.7%) received fistuloclysis. Infectious source control procedures were applied to 1042 patients, including 711 (62.0%) with active lavage and drainage and 331 (28.9%) with passive drainage. Among them, 841 patients (73.4%) underwent minimally invasive procedures of infectious source control (replacement of drainage tube through sinus tract, puncture drainage, etc.), 201 (17.5%) underwent laparotomy drainage, while 104 (9.1%) did not undergo any drainage measures. A total of 610 patients (53.2%) received definitive operation, 24 patients died within postoperative 30-day with mortality of 3.9% (24/610), 69 (11.3%) developed surgical site infection (SSI), and 24 (3.9%) had a relapse of fistula. The highest cure rate was achieved in ileocecal fistula (100%), followed by rectal fistula (96.2%, 128/133) and duodenal stump fistula (95.7%,44/46). The highest mortality was found in combined internal fistula (3/12) and no death in ileocecal fistula. Univariate prognostic analysis showed that primary diseases as Crohn's disease (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=6.570, P=0.010) and appendicitis/appendiceal abscess (P=0.012), intestinal fistula combining with internal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=5.460, P=0.019), multiple ECF (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=7.135, P=0.008), esophagogastric / esophagojejunal anastomotic fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.501, P=0.002), ECF at ileocecal junction (P=0.012), non-drainage/passive drainage before the diagnosis of intestinal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.688, P=0.008), non-drainage/passive drainage after the diagnosis of intestinal fistula (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=9.711, P=0.008), complicating with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=179.699, P<0.001), sepsis (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=211.851, P<0.001), hemorrhage (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=85.300, P<0.001), pulmonary infection (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=60.096, P<0.001), catheter-associated infection (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=10.617, P=0.001) and malnutrition (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=21.199, P<0.001) were associated with mortality. Multivariate prognostic analysis cofirmed that sepsis (OR=7.103, 95%CI:3.694-13.657, P<0.001), complicating with MODS (OR=5.018, 95%CI:2.170-11.604, P<0.001), and hemorrhage (OR=4.703, 95%CI: 2.300-9.618, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of the death for ECF patients. Meanwhile, active lavage and drainage after the definite ECF diagnosis was the protective factor (OR=0.223, 95%CI: 0.067-0.745, P=0.015). Conclusions: The overall mortality of ECF is still high. Surgical operation is the most common cause of ECF. Complications e.g. sepsis, MODS, hemorrhage, and catheter-associated infection, are the main causes of death. Active lavage and drainage is important to improve the prognosis of ECF. labels: #China#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Intestinal Fistula#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Prospective Studies#Risk Factors"
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of T2WI signal intensity related parameters that can be obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with locally advanved rectal cancer (LARC). Methods: Signal Intensity of Tumor (SIT) and Signal Intensity of Tumor/Muscle (SIT/M) of MR T2WI before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of 101 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were evaluated by two experienced readers independently. Signal Intensity of Tumor Reduction Rate (SITRR) and Signal Intensity of Tumor/Muscle Reduction Rate (SIT/MRR) were calculated. The difference of related parameters of T2WI tumor signal intensity between the pCR and the non-pCR group were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic performance for predicting pCR. Results: Of the 101 patients, 18 were in pCR group and 83 were in non-pCR group. In all patients, the SITpre, SITpost, SITRR, SIT/Mpre, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by reader 1 were 197.0 (133.0), 144.2 (69.7), 0.4% (0.5%), 2.6 (0.6), 3.0 (2.3) and 0.4 (0.2)% in pCR group, and 227.0 (99.0), 205 (95.4), 0.1% (0.6%), 2.6 (0.6), 2.6 (1) in non-pCR group, respectively. SITpre, SITpost, SITRR, SIT/Mpre, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by reader 2 were 193.0 (135.0), 143.0 (69.8), 0.4% (0.2%), 2.6 (0.6), 1.5 (0.5) and 0.39% (0.2%) in pCR group, and 234.0(108.0), 203(96.5), 0.1% (0.3%), 2.6 (0.6%), 1.7 (0.7) and 0.25% (0.2%) in non-pCR group, respectively. Between the pCR and non-pCR group, there were significant differences in SITpost, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR measured by both readers (all P<0.01), but there was no significant differences in SITpre and SIT/Mpre (P>0.05). The difference of SITRR measured by reader 1 was not statistically significant (P=0.415), while the difference of SITRR measured by reader 2 was statistically significant (P=0.001). In patients with rectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, SITpost, SIT/Mpost, SITRR and SIT/MRR measured by two physicians were still statistically significant between the pCR and non-pCR group (all P<0.01), but SITpre and SIT/Mpre had no significant difference (P>0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that in all patients, the area under curve (AUC) of SITpost, SIT/Mpost and SIT/MRR for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer was 0.694-0.762, the sensitivity was 68.2%-77.3%, and the specificity was 63.6%-77.3%. In rectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma patients, the AUC, sensitivity and specificity was 0.704-0.764, 62.7%-78.9% and 66.2%-84.2%, respectively. Conclusions: T2WI signal intensity related parameters are potential predictors for pCR in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiptherapy. The predictive value is higher in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. labels: #Chemoradiotherapy#Humans#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Neoadjuvant Therapy#ROC Curve#Rectal Neoplasms#Treatment Outcome'
b'Plant factories have been developed to replace traditional agriculture, aiming to solve future problems of food availability. However, the nutrient solution in a plant factory is discharged after a single batch of plant cultivation, giving rise to large amounts of waste nutrient solution. Microalgae can be used to treat a wide variety of wastewater and effectively remove excessive nutrients from wastewater. Therefore, the incorporation of microalgal cultivation into a plant factory to treat waste nutrients would be a reasonable approach facilitating removal of waste nutrients with concomitant production of algal biomass. In this study, we isolated novel microalgal species suitable for the growth in waste nutrients from a plant factory and subsequently an underwater LED photobioreactor was constructed being incorporated into the plant factory system. Finally, treated waste nutrient solution was recycled back into the plant factory and successfully used for the cultivation of plant of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To evaluate the value of Gd-BOPTA enhanced MRI in the staging of liver fibrosis. Method: Fifty male SD rats (6-week-old, 180-220 g) were divided into the modeling group (n=42) and the control group (n=8). The model of liver fibrosis in the modeling group was established by carbon tetrachloride (animal license No. SYXK (Su) 2017-0043). From week 2 to week 10, rats in the modeling group (n=4) and control group (n=1) were randomly selected to scan 1 h(RER1), 2 h(RER2) and 3 h(RER3) after injection of Gd-BOPTA, respectively, to measure the relative enhancement rate (RER) of liver parenchyma. The shape of intrahepatic bile duct and the degree of enhancement at each time point were observed. Results: Forty-two rats (34 rats in the modeling group and 8 rats in the control group) completed the experiment. RER1, RER2 and RER3 of the control group were 1.44\\xc2\\xb10.37, 1.22\\xc2\\xb10.37 and 0.84\\xc2\\xb10.28 respectively. RER1, RER2 and RER3 of the modeling group were respectively: S1 (n=6): 1.49\\xc2\\xb10.48, 1.29\\xc2\\xb10.39, 0.91\\xc2\\xb10.38;S2 (n=9): 1.48\\xc2\\xb10.44, 1.34\\xc2\\xb10.37, 1.04\\xc2\\xb10.40;S3 (n=11): 1.49\\xc2\\xb10.43, 1.37\\xc2\\xb10.39, 1.21\\xc2\\xb10.30; S4 (n=8): 1.49\\xc2\\xb10.44, 1.40\\xc2\\xb10.37, 1.24\\xc2\\xb10.40. There was no significant difference in RER1 and RER2 values between the control group and the liver fibrosis group (F=0.022, P=0.999; F=0.301, P=0.875). There were significant differences between the control group and RER3 values of hepatic fibrosis stage S3 and S4 (t=2.249, P=0.031; t=2.274, P=0.029), there was no significant difference between the remaining groups (all P>0.05).In the control group, the intrahepatic bile duct was obviously strengthened within 1 hour after enhancement, and walked naturally. The intrahepatic bile duct was slightly enhanced 1h after the enhancement of S3-S4 stage of hepatic fibrosis, and the intrahepatic bile duct was significantly enhanced 2-3 hours later, with distorted alignment. Conclusion: Delayed 3 hours liver parenchymal RER and intrahepatic bile duct distortion delay enhancement after Gd-BOPTA enhancement contribute to the S3-S4 diagnosis of liver fibrosis. labels: #Animals#Contrast Media#Gadolinium DTPA#Liver Cirrhosis#Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Male#Meglumine#Organometallic Compounds#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'This work aimed to study the application of liquid biphasic flotation (LBF) for the efficient and rapid recovery of astaxanthin from H. pluvialis microalgae. The performance of LBF for the extraction of astaxanthin was studied comprehensively under different operating conditions, including types and concentrations of food-grade alcohol and salt, volume ratio, addition of neutral salt, flotation period, and mass of dried H. pluvialis biomass powder. The maximum recovery, extraction efficiency and partition coefficient of astaxanthin obtained from the optimum LBF system were 95.11\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf1.35%, 99.84\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf0.05% and 385.16\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf3.87, respectively. A scaled-up LBF system was also performed, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting natural astaxanthin from microalgae at a larger scale. This exploration of LBF system opens a promising avenue to the extraction of astaxanthin at lower cost and shorter processing time. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for chronic radiation intestinal injury. Methods: A descriptive cohort study was performed. Clinical data of 73 patients with definite radiation history and diagnosed clinically as chronic radiation intestinal injury, undergoing operation at Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 1, 2012 to February 28, 2019, were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Patients did not undergo operation or only received adhesiolysis were excluded. All the patients had preoperative examination and overall evaluation of the disease. According to severity of intestinal obstruction and patients' diet, corresponding nutritional support and conservative treatment were given. Surgical methods: The one-stage bowel resection and anastomosis was the first choice for surgical treatment of chronic radiation intestinal injury. Patients with poor nutritional condition were given enterostomy and postoperative enteral nutrition and second-stage stoma closure and intestinal anastomosis if nutritional condition improved. For those who were unable to perform stoma closure, a permanent stoma should be performed. Patients with severe abdominal adhesion which was difficult to separate, enterostomy or bypass surgery after adhesiolysis would be the surgical choice. For patients with tumor metastasis or recurrence, enterostomy or bypass surgery should be selected. Observation parameters: the overall and major (Clavien-Dindo grades III to V) postoperative complication within 30 days after surgery or during hospitalization; mortality within postoperative 30 days; postoperative hospital stay; time to postoperative recovery of enteral nutrition; time to removal of drainage tube. Results: Of the 73 patients who had been enrolled in this study, 10 were male and 63 were female with median age of 54 (range, 34-80) years. Preoperative evaluation showed that 61 patients had intestinal stenosis, 63 had intestinal obstruction, 11 had intestinal perforation, 20 had intestinal fistula, 3 had intestinal bleeding, and 6 had abdominal abscess, of whom 64(87.7%) patients had multiple complications. Tumor recurrence or metastasis was found in 15 patients. A total of 65(89.0%) patients received preoperative nutritional support, of whom 35 received total parenteral nutrition and 30 received partial parenteral nutrition. The median preoperative nutritional support duration was 8.5 (range, 6.0-16.2) days. The rate of one-stage intestine resection was 69.9% (51/73), and one-stage enterostomy was 23.3% (17/73). In the 51 patients undergoing bowel resection, the average length of resected bowel was (50.3\\xc2\\xb149.1) cm. Among the 45 patients with intestinal anastomosis, 4 underwent manual anastomosis and 41 underwent stapled anastomosis; 36 underwent side-to-side anastomosis, 5 underwent end-to-side anastomosis, and 4 underwent end-to-end anastomosis. Eighty postoperative complications occurred in 39 patients and the overall postoperative complication rate was 53.4% (39/73), including 39 moderate to severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-V) in 20 patients (27.4%, 20/73) and postoperative anastomotic leakage in 2 patients (2.7%, 2/73). The mortality within postoperative 30 days was 2.7% (2/73); both patients died of abdominal infection, septic shock, and multiple organ failure caused by anastomotic leakage. The median postoperative hospital stay was 13 (11, 23) days, the postoperative enteral nutrition time was (7.2\\xc2\\xb16.9) days and the postoperative drainage tube removal time was (6.3\\xc2\\xb14.2) days. Conclusions: Surgical treatment, especially one-stage anastomosis, is safe and feasible for chronic radiation intestine injury. Defining the extent of bowel resection, rational selection of the anatomic position of the anastomosis and perioperative nutritional support treatment are the key to reduce postoperative complications. labels: #Adult#Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Anastomosis, Surgical#Anastomotic Leak#Chronic Disease#Enterostomy#Female#Humans#Intestinal Diseases#Intestines#Male#Middle Aged#Nutrition Assessment#Nutritional Status#Radiation Injuries#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and related proteins of inflammation and anti-oxidative stress in spinal cord in mice with spinal cord injury (SCI), so as to explore its mechanisms underlying function repair.METHODS: Thirty-six female C57BL/6 mice were equally randomized into 3 groups: sham operation, model and EA. The SCI model was established by clamping the spinal cord for 25 s with a serrefine after laminectomy of the 1st lumbar vertebra (L1). EA (1.5 Hz/7.5 Hz, 1.0 mA) was applied to bila-teral "Zusanli" (ST36) and "Sanyinjiao" (SP6) for 10 min, once a day for 7 days. The hindlimb locomotor function was assessed according to the state of the range of motion, coordination, claw gesture of the hind leg ankle-joint, trunk stabi-lity and the tail posture by using Basso Mouse Scale(BMS). The histopathological changes of the injured area of the spinal cord were determined by H.E. staining. The expression levels of ApoE, phosphorylated nuclear transcription factor-\\xc3\\xaaB(p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB), interleukin 1 beta(IL-1\\xc3\\xa2), phosphorylated extracellular regulatory protein kinase(p-ERK1/2), extracellular regulatory protein kinase(ERK1/2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) and heme oxidase-1(HO-1) in the spinal cord were detected by Western blot, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were displayed by immunofluorescence staining.RESULTS: After modeling, the BMS scores were significantly decreased in the model group compared with the sham operation group (P<0.05). Following EA, the BMS scores were markedly increased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05), suggesting an improvement of the hindlimb locomotor function. H.E. stain showed structural disorder with lots of cavities, severe inflammatory infiltration with large quantity of inflammatory cells, and apparent reduction of normal neurons in the injured spinal cord tissue of model group, which was milder in the EA group. The expression levels of ApoE, p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB, IL-1\\xc3\\xa2, p-ERK1/2 (not ERK1/2), Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly increased in the model group than those in the sham operation group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression levels of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, Nrf2 and HO-1 were further notably up-regulated (P<0.05), and those of p-NF-\\xc3\\xaaB and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 proteins obviously down-regulated in the EA group (P<0.05). Immunoflorescence staining showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells was apparently increased in the model group compared with the sham operation group and observably decreased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: EA can significantly improve locomotor function in SCI mice, which is associated with its effects in reducing inflammation, oxi-dative stress reactions and reactive astrocyte proliferation via up-regulating expression of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, and Nrf2/HO-1 (antioxidant pathway) and inhibiting IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 and NF-\\xc3\\xaaB expression. labels: #Animals#Electroacupuncture#Female#Heat-Shock Proteins#Inflammation#Locomotion#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Oxidative Stress#Spinal Cord#Spinal Cord Injuries'
b'Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) has attracted increasing interest, yet throughput remains one major factor limiting its broader application. Here we present an integrated Raman-activated droplet sorting (RADS) microfluidic system for functional screening of live cells in a label-free and high-throughput manner, by employing AXT-synthetic industrial microalga Haematococcus pluvialis (H. pluvialis) as a model. Raman microspectroscopy analysis of individual cells is carried out prior to their microdroplet encapsulation, which is then directly coupled to DEP-based droplet sorting. To validate the system, H. pluvialis cells containing different levels of AXT were mixed and underwent RADS. Those AXT-hyperproducing cells were sorted with an accuracy of 98.3%, an enrichment ratio of eight folds, and a throughput of ?260 cells/min. Of the RADS-sorted cells, 92.7% remained alive and able to proliferate, which is equivalent to the unsorted cells. Thus, the RADS achieves a much higher throughput than existing RACS systems, preserves the vitality of cells, and facilitates seamless coupling with downstream manipulations such as single-cell sequencing and cultivation. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the predictive performances of anatomic staging system (AS) and prognostic staging system (PS) proposed in the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual in patients with pure mucinous breast cancer (PMBC). Methods: Clinicopathologic features and follow-up information were collected from a total of 3628 patients with PMBC. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were compared among patients in different stage groups. Likelihood ratio (LR) \\xc3\\xb7(2), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were used to evaluate the predictive performances of AS and PS in PMBC. Results: In PMBC, BCSS was associated with tumor size (P=0.002), lymph node status (P=0.002), grade(P=0.003), PR status(P=0.017)and the receipt of radiation. Compared to AS, 1326 patients (37.54%) underwent stage change after applying PS, with 6.50% upstaged and 37.04% downstaged. There were significant differences in BCSS among patients of different stages under the AS and PS (P<0.001). However, PS was not superior to AS in predicting prognosis (AS vs PS, LR \\xc3\\xb7(2): 16.41 vs 17.5; AIC: 357.44 vs 358.35; C-index, 0.72 vs 0.73, P=0.667). Conclusions: Both of AS and PS proposed in the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual were predictive factors in patients with PMBC. Compared with AS, the PS did not show superiority in prognosis prediction among patients with PMBC. labels: #Breast Neoplasms#Humans#Likelihood Functions#Neoplasm Grading#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Survival Rate#United States"
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the dynamic changes of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E5 gene in the development of cervical cancer and the significance of E5 mRNA in early screening of cervical cancer.METHODS: Paraffin specimens of cervical lesions were collected from 49 cases (HPV positive) during September 2015 to December 2017 According to the standard of FIGO, all cervical lesions were diagnosed as: 13 cases of cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia disorders (CIN) ? in 5 cases, CIN ? in 18 cases, CIN ? in 5 cases, 8 cases of cervical cancer. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the integrity of E5 gene and the mRNA expression levels of E5, E6 and E 7in cervical tissues.RESULTS: All the 49 cases showed positive HPV16 infection. E5 genetic integrity in CIN?was higher than that in cervical inflammation, CIN ?and cervical cancer (P < 0.05), which was also higher than that in CIN ?, but without statistically significance (P>0.05). The mRNA levels of E5, E6, E7 were the highest in CIN ?. Compared with E6 and E7, E5 presented superior expression in all types of cervical lesions (P < 0.05), while E 6and E7 mRNA expressions only increased in CIN ? and cervical cancer.CONCLUSION: In the patients with HPV16 infection, the integrity of E5 gene in cervical tissues may be related to the occurrence and development of cervical diseases. E5 gene is expected to be the target gene for early screening of cervical cancer. labels: #Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia#Female#Human papillomavirus 16#Humans#Oncogene Proteins, Viral#Papillomavirus Infections#Uterine Cervical Neoplasms'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the protective effects of quercetin (QE) on triptolide (TP) induced liver injury and the relevant mechanism.METHODS: Forty C57BL/6 mice were equally divided into 4 groups, control group, TP model group, 20 mg/kg QE treatment group and 80 mg/kg QE treatment group randomly. The 20 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg QE groups were gastrointestinal administration with QE at the dose of 0.2 mL/10 g for 10 d, twice daily, while other groups were administrated with equivalent normal saline. Four hours post the last dose, animals were gastrointestinal administered with TP at a dose of 500 \\xc3\\xacg/kg per mouse, except for NS control. All the mice were sacrificed 22 h later, blood and liver tissue samples were collected. The pathologic change of liver tissue was detected by HE staining. The level of aminotransferase (AST) and aspartate alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum, and the level of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver tissue homogenates were detected using the commercial kits. The level of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-10 and IL-6 in liver tissue homogenates was measured by ELISA. Hepatic expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was detected by Western blot.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, in the TP model group, hepatic lobule structure atrophied and even disappeared, hepatic cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration are obvious. Additionally, in TP model group, serum ALT, AST and MDA levels were significantly increased, SOD and GSH levels were decreased, IL-6 and IL-17 levels were increased, IL-10 levels were decreased, and TLR4 protein levels were increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the TP model group, liver tissue injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were reduced in the QE group, and serum levels of ALT, AST, MDA, IL-6 and IL-17 were all decreased. TLR4 expression was down-regulated (P < 0.05) in both QE groups, and the decease levle was more significant in the high-dose QE group (P < 0.05, compared with the low-dose QE group).CONCLUSION: Quercetin can reduce TP-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative damage, promoting antioxidant and regulating cytokine secretion. labels: #Animals#Antioxidants#Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury#Cytokines#Diterpenes#Epoxy Compounds#Liver#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Oxidative Stress#Phenanthrenes#Quercetin#Random Allocation'
b'BACKGROUD: Foliicolous algae are a common occurrence in tropical forests. They are referable to a few simple morphotypes (unicellular, sarcinoid-like or filamentous), which makes their morphology of limited usefulness for taxonomic studies and species diversity assessments. The relationship between algal community and their host phyllosphere was not clear. In order to obtain a more accurate assessment, we used single molecule real-time sequencing of the 18S rDNA gene to characterize the eukaryotic algal community in an area of South-western China.RESULT: We annotated 2922 OTUs belonging to five classes, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Dinophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae. Novel clades formed by large numbers sequences of green algae were detected in the order Trentepohliales (Ulvophyceae) and the Watanabea clade (Trebouxiophyceae), suggesting that these foliicolous communities may be substantially more diverse than so far appreciated and require further research. Species in Trentepohliales, Watanabea clade and Apatococcus clade were detected as the core members in the phyllosphere community studied. Communities from different host trees and sampling sites were not significantly different in terms of OTUs composition. However, the communities of Musa and Ravenala differed from other host plants significantly at the genus level, since they were dominated by Trebouxiophycean epiphytes.CONCLUSION: The cryptic diversity of eukaryotic algae especially Chlorophytes in tropical phyllosphere is very high. The community structure at species-level has no significant relationship either with host phyllosphere or locations. The core algal community in tropical phyllopshere is consisted of members from Trentepohliales, Watanabea clade and Apatococcus clade. Our study provided a large amount of novel 18S rDNA sequences that will be useful to unravel the cryptic diversity of phyllosphere eukaryotic algae and for comparisons with similar future studies on this type of communities. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Silver nanomaterials (AgNMs) of different shapes and sizes are potentially toxic to aquatic organisms. However, studies on the toxicity of AgNMs and on their shape-dependent effects on algae are scarce. The present study evaluated the effects of three AgNMs (silver nanospheres, AgNPs; silver nanowires, AgNWs; silver nanoplates, AgPLs) with different shapes coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone on the growth and photosynthetic performance of an alga, Chlorococcum infusionum. We used growth measurements and determined the photosynthetic parameters based on chlorophyll fluorescence transients in the algal cells exposed to different concentrations of the three AgNMs. The effective concentrations at 50% (EC50) of AgNPs, AgNWs, and AgPLs were calculated to be 0.1, 0.045, and 0.021\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg/L, respectively. The results showed that the toxicity of AgNMs in C. infusionum was in the order, AgPLs (40\\xe2\\x80\\xafnm diameter) >\\xe2\\x80\\xafAgNWs (21,000\\xe2\\x80\\xafnm length ? 42\\xe2\\x80\\xafnm diameter) >\\xe2\\x80\\xafAgNPs (57\\xe2\\x80\\xafnm diameter), based on the decrease in growth and three photosynthetic activities. We propose that the toxic potential of AgNMs is primarily dependent on their diameter and secondarily on their shape. Overall, this study provides, for the first time, a comparison of the growth and photosynthetic activities of C. infusionum exposed to AgNMs of three different shapes. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The present study aimed to investigate the safety and short-term outcome of laparoscopy-assisted distal radical gastrectomy in treating gastric cancer among obese patients.Perioperative outcomes were compared between 67 gastric cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) ?25\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m (obese group) and 198 ones with BMI <25\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m (non-obese group). All the cases underwent laparoscopic radical resection between April 2009 and October 2013.The value of BMI was 27.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.67\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m in the obese group and 21.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x8a2.64\\xe2\\x80\\x8akg/m in non-obese group. There were no significant differences between 2 groups in age, sex, presence of diabetes, tumor size, number of metastatic lymph nodes, or metastatic lymph node ratio. Postoperative complications did not differ between the 2 groups (P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a>\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.05).

b'Objective To prepare inducible lupus model mice and investigate the effect of nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) gene mutation on the autoimmune response of mice with induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods The 3-month wild-type B6 (B6-WT) mice were used as a control group and the NASP mutant B6 (B6-NASPM) mice as an experimental group. Mouse spleen lymphocytes were activated with concanavalin A (ConA), and the DNA was extracted as autoantigen. B6-WT mice and B6-NASPM mice were immunized three times. Serum anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) IgG levels were detected by ELISA. Renal lesions were detected by HE staining. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the deposition of IgG and complement C3 in the renal tissues. Flow cytometry was applied to compare the spleen lymphocyte subsets in B6-WT and B6-NASPM mice and to explore the mechanism of NASP gene mutation affecting the immune response in mice. Results Compared with B6-WT mice, B6-NASPM mice showed no significant changes in body weight, kidney index and spleen index; serum anti-dsDNA IgG levels significantly increased; glomerular cell proliferation was obvious and the deposition of IgG and C3 in the renal tissues increased. The proportion of spleen CD3+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased, while the proportion of CD19+ B cells and regulatory B cells (Breg) increased. Conclusion Mutation in the NASP gene can increase the levels of anti-dsDNA IgG antibodies, promote cell proliferation in the glomerulus of the kidney, deposition of IgG antibodies and complement C3, alter the proportion of immune cells in the spleen and aggravate the autoimmune response in lupus model mice. labels: #Animals#Antibodies, Antinuclear#Autoantigens#Autoimmunity#Cell Cycle Proteins#Complement C3#Disease Models, Animal#Kidney Glomerulus#Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic#Mice#Mutation#Nuclear Proteins#Spleen'
b'The overwhelming response towards algal biodiesel production has been well-recognized recently as a sustainable alternative to conventional fuels. Most microalgae cannot grow well at acidic pH. The present study, therefore, investigated whether non-acidophilic microalgae Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp. MAS3 can be acclimated to extreme-acidic pH for sustainable production of biomass and biodiesel. Growth analysis indicated that both the microalgal strains possessed a passive uptake of CO2 at pH 3.0 with biomass production of 0.25\\xe2\\x80\\xafg dry\\xe2\\x80\\xafwt.\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1 in Desmodemus sp. and 0.45\\xe2\\x80\\xafg dry\\xe2\\x80\\xafwt.\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1 in Heterochlorella sp.. Flow-cytometry analysis for reactive oxygen species, membrane permeability and neutral-lipids revealed the capabilities of both strains to adapt to the stress imposed by acidic pH. Lipid production was doubled in both the strains when grown at pH 3.0. In-situ transesterification of biomass resulted in 13-15% FAME yield in the selected microalgae, indicating their great potential in biofuel production. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between plasma adiponectin levels and risk of breast cancer by molecular subtype.METHODS: A case-control study including 437 histopathologic confirmed primary breast cancer cases and 469 healthy female controls was conducted between April 2014 and May 2015. Basic information of the participants were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected and the plasma adiponectin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELASA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences of plasma adiponectin levels among the control group and the breast cancer groups with different molecular subtypes. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the association between plasma adiponectin levels and risk of breast cancer by molecular subtypes. All the statistical analyses were stratified by menopausal status.RESULTS: Among the 437 breast cancer cases, there were 310 Luminal breast cancer cases, 83 HER-2-enriched breast cancer cases and 44 basal-like breast cancer cases. The median (P25, P75) of plasma adiponectin level of the controls was 14.85 (9.69, 21.35) \\xc3\\xacg/mL. The medians (P25, P75) of plasma adiponectin levels of the cases were 11.74 (8.15, 16.14) \\xc3\\xacg/mL, 12.02(8.43, 16.96) \\xc3\\xacg/mL and 12.67(8.25, 17.27) \\xc3\\xacg/mL for Luminal, HER-2-enriched and basal-like subtype respectively, which were statistically different from the controls (P < 0.001). Multinomial logistic regression showed that, after adjustment for the confounders, the higher levels of plasma adiponectin were associated with the lower risks of pre-menopausal Luminal breast cancer (ORpre-menopausal Luminal=0.50, 95%CI: 0.27-0.92, Ptrend=0.001), post-menopausal Luminal breast cancer (ORpost-menopausal Luminal=0.06, 95%CI: 0.02-0.23, Ptrend < 0.001) and post-menopausal HER-2-enriched breast cancer (ORpost-menopausal HER-2-enriched=0.06, 95%CI: 0.01-0.62, Ptrend=0.001).CONCLUSION: Lower levels of plasma adiponectin may increase the risk of pre-menopausal and post-menopausal Luminal breast cancer and post-menopausal HER-2-enriched breast cancer. labels: #Adiponectin#Breast Neoplasms#Case-Control Studies#Female#Humans#Risk Factors'

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupunctur (EA) and moxibustion of left or right "Tian-shu" (ST25) on intragastric pressure (IGP) in normal rats.METHODS: Twenty male SD rats were equally and randomly divided into EA group and moxibustion group. EA (2 Hz/15 Hz, 2 mA) or moxibustion (46-48 ?) was applied to unilate-ral ST25 for 2 min. The IGP was detected by using a pressure-transducer and an amplifier before and after EA or moxibustion.RESULTS: Compared with pre-intervention, the IGP was significantly decreased after EA or moxibustion stimulation of both left and right ST25 (P<0.05). The IGP levels during 0-30 s and 30-60 s of EA stimulation of both left and right ST25 were significantly lower than those of moxibustion (P<0.05). The IGP-lowering effect of EA on the left ST25 was evidently stronger than that of the right ST25 (P<0.05), but without significant difference between the bilateral sides in moxibustion-induced IGP reduction (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: Both EA and moxibustion of ST25 can lower IGP, and the effect of EA is significantly stronger than that of moxibustion in normal rats. In addition, the IGP-lowering effect of EA of the left ST25 is markedly stronger than that of the right ST25, suggesting a lateral advantage effect. labels: #Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Moxibustion#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'
b'BACKGROUND: There have been several case-control studies to assess the relationship between the transforming growth factor-\\xc3\\xa21 (TGF-\\xc3\\xa21) T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) gene polymorphism and lung cancer in recent years; however, the results remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the potential correlation between the TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C/C-509T polymorphism and increased risk of lung cancer through meta-analysis.METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library database, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang Data Information Service platform to identify relevant case-control studies in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to evaluate the correlation between TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 gene polymorphism and lung tumor risk. Sensitivity analysis and Egger test were used to evaluate the stability of the results and possible publication bias.RESULTS: A total of 8 studies, with 3680 patients and 4018 controls, were included. The meta-analysis revealed that there was no conspicuous correlation between the TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) variant and lung cancer in the overall population. For TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 C-509T, a significant decreased risk was identified in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the analysis stratified by disease (TT vs CT\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8aCC: P\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a.02, OR\\xe2\\x80\\x8a=\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.90). However, for TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C, subgroup analysis showed no correlation between the T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in patients with NSCLC. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no distinct association was observed between T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in the Asian and Caucasian groups. Moreover, no significant association was found in the analysis of groups stratified by age, sex, and smoking history.CONCLUSION: The TGF-\\xc3\\xa21 T\\xe2\\x80\\x8a+\\xe2\\x80\\x8a869C (rs1982073) and C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphisms are not implicated in lung cancer susceptibility in the overall population. However, our analysis indicated that the C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism decreases the risk of lung cancer in patients with NSCLC. labels: #Case-Control Studies#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Transforming Growth Factor beta1'
b'HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: Where Are We Today? Abstract. In sub-Saharan Africa the HIV epidemic has changed remarkedly due to expanded testing and easier access to antiretroviral medication. The rate of new infections has decreased substantially since 2005, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has increased and the mortality rate has declined. Yet still a lot needs to be achieved to stop the ongoing epidemic. Women are still at a higher risk to get infected and stigma and discrimination are a hindrance to further reduce the incidence. Challenges like the lack of technical capacities, especially to perform viral load and resistance testing, refusal of testing or condom use and increasing drug resistance to first-line therapies jeopardize the goal of 90-90-90: 90 % of people tested, 90 % of positives under care and 90 % of treated persons virologically controlled. New testing strategies and medication with higher efficacies which, when taken regularly, stop the transmission completely, provide hope in the fight against HIV. labels: #Africa South of the Sahara#Anti-HIV Agents#Female#HIV Infections#Humans#Incidence#Social Stigma'
b'Microalgae are a promising biofuel resource, but their high cost and low productivity hinder their commercial applications. In the present study, Monoraphidium sp. QLZ-3 was cultivated in walnut shell extracts (WSE) supplemented with carbon dioxide (CO2). Biomass was enhanced from 0.40\\xe2\\x80\\xafg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1 to 1.18\\xe2\\x80\\xafg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1, and lipid content reached 49.54% in WSE-12% CO2 media. Biomass and lipid productivity reached 196.88 and 97.52\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1\\xe2\\x80\\xafd-1, which were 1.33- and 1.57-fold higher than those of the control, respectively. The amount of carbohydrates increased, but the protein contents decreased. Furthermore, the application of CO2 promoted nutrient and polyphenol absorption and upregulated the expression levels of lipid biosynthetic genes of this WSE-cultivated alga. These results indicated that coupling WSE and CO2 could be an efficient strategy to enhance biofuel production by microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To clarify the effect of TRAF2 in the biological behavior of gastric cancer and explore the mechanism. Methods: TRAF2 stably depleted AGS cell was established. Cell growth was monitored by x-CELLigence system. Cell proliferation was detected using cell viability assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. The difference of migration and invasion abilities were measured by real-time xCELLigence system and Transwell. The expression and activity of NF-\\xc3\\xaaB signaling pathway were measured by western blot and TransAM assay. The expression of TRAF2 in gastric cancer tissue and its clinical significance were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The cell index of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was significantly lower than that of AGS-sictrl cells at 8 h. In the cell viability assay, the A values of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were 51 296.00\\xc2\\xb12 631.06, 68 389.25\\xc2\\xb16 703.21 and 65 559.50\\xc2\\xb16 339.22 at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The values of the viability of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were significantly lower than those of AGS-sictrl cells (P<0.001). The results of flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis rates of AGS-siTRAF2 cells were (1.42\\xc2\\xb10.07)%, (2.98\\xc2\\xb10.11)% and (1.56\\xc2\\xb10.03)% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of AGS-sictrl cells (all P<0.05). The distribution of S phase in AGS-siTRAF2 cells was (23.57\\xc2\\xb11.12)%, while that in the AGS-sictrl cells was (19.49\\xc2\\xb11.19)%. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). AGS-siTRAF2 cells migrated much slower than AGS-sictrl cells from 3 h and the number of migrated AGS-sictrl cells was 121.7\\xc2\\xb16.7 while that of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was 84.0\\xc2\\xb16.6 (P=0.002). The cell index of AGS-siTRAF2 cells was less than that of AGS-sictrl cells from 3 h. In Transwell assay, the number of invaded AGS-sictrl cells was 109.3\\xc2\\xb13.1 after 24 h of culture, significantly higher than 79.0\\xc2\\xb16.2 of AGS-siTRAF2 cells (P=0.002). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of RelA, RelB, p50 and p52 in AGS-siTRAF2 cells were significantly lower than those in AGS-sictrl cells. The activities of RelA, RelB, p50 and p52 in AGS-siTRAF2 cells were 0.01\\xc2\\xb10.00, 0.01\\xc2\\xb10.01, 0.92\\xc2\\xb10.01 and 0.53\\xc2\\xb10.03, respectively, significantly lower than those of AGS-sictrl cells (all P<0.001). High TRAF2 expression (TRAF2-high) was found in 53.0% of GC samples, while TRAF2-high was only observed in 38.0% of the paired adjacent tissues (P=0.033). The expression of TRAF2 was significantly higher in the tubular adenocarcinoma, poor differentiation advanced T, advanced N, and clinical staging (P<0.05). The median survival time were 17 months and 78 months in the TRAF2 high-expression and low-expression groups, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.010). Conclusions: Depletion of TRAF2 inhibits the AGS cell growth, migration and invasion. The expression of TRAF2 is increased in gastric tumor tissue. The expression of TRAF2 is associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer. labels: #Apoptosis#Cell Line, Tumor#Cell Movement#Cell Proliferation#Humans#Neoplasm Invasiveness#Signal Transduction#Stomach Neoplasms#TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2'
b'The biofuels are receiving considerable attention as a substitute for petro diesel. For microalgae, the cell density or biomass and lipid contents are key components for biodiesel production. This study was conducted to develop favorable culture conditions for Dunaliella salina to maximize its biomass and lipid accumulation. The effect of salinity (0.5 to 2.5\\xe2\\x80\\x89M NaCl) on the cell population, biochemical composition, and lipid output of Dunaliella salina was examined under a controlled environment for 21 days. Maximum growth (6.57\\xe2\\x80\\x89?\\xe2\\x80\\x89107 to 7.17\\xe2\\x80\\x89?\\xe2\\x80\\x89107cells mL-1) potentials were observed at 1.5 to 2\\xe2\\x80\\x89M NaCl. The photosynthetic pigments and carbohydrates also showed trends similar to growth. The maximum carotenoid level (5.16\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg\\xe2\\x80\\x89L-1) was recorded at 2\\xe2\\x80\\x89M NaCl. Almost all physicochemical parameters increased with increases in salinity, biomass (1231.66\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\x891.26\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg\\xe2\\x80\\x89L-1) and lipid content (248.33\\xe2\\x80\\x89mg\\xe2\\x80\\x89L-1), as recorded at 2\\xe2\\x80\\x89M NaCl. Based on fluorescence intensity, the highest values (11.84\\xe2\\x80\\x89?\\xe2\\x80\\x89107cells/ml) of neutral lipids and total lipids (22.28%) were recorded at optimum salinity levels. The present study suggests that a high biomass and lipid accumulation of Dunaliella salina SA 134 could be obtained at the 2\\xe2\\x80\\x89M NaCl level. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Much of our current knowledge of microbial growth is obtained from studies at a population level. Driven by the realization that processes that operate within a population might influence a population's behavior, we sought to better understand Tetradesmus obliquus (formerly Scenedesmus obliquus) physiology at the cellular level. In this work, an accurate pretreatment method to quantitatively obtain single cells of T.\\xc2\\xa0obliquus, a coenobia-forming alga, is described. These single cells were examined by flow cytometry for triacylglycerol (TAG), chlorophyll, and protein content, and their cell sizes were recorded by coulter counter. We quantified heterogeneity of size and TAG content at single-cell level for a population of T.\\xc2\\xa0obliquus during a controlled standard batch cultivation. Unexpectedly, variability of TAG content per cell within the population increased throughout the batch run, up to 400 times in the final stage of the batch run, with values ranging from 0.25 to 99\\xc2\\xa0pg\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0cell-1 . Two subpopulations, classified as having low or high TAG content per cell, were identified. Cell size also increased during batch growth with average values from 36 to 70\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\xacm3 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb7\\xc2\\xa0cell-1 ; yet cell size variability increased only up to 16 times. Cell size and cellular TAG content were not correlated at the single-cell level. Our data show clearly that TAG production is affected by cell-to-cell variation, which suggests that its control and better understanding of the underlying processes may improve the productivity of T.\\xc2\\xa0obliquus for industrial processes such as biodiesel production. labels: #Chlorophyceae"
b"Public parks are leisure environments widely used by both, adults and children, often accompained by their pets. Soil contamination of these environments by enteric viruses and intestinal parasites occurs through these animals feces. The aim of this work was to detect Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPV-1) and different species of Mastadenovirus in soils samples from a park located in a medium-sized city in Brazil and evaluate the presence of helminth eggs and larvae in 18 points of a public park soil samples, as well as feces found on this site during six months. Parasitological analyzes were conducted through flotation and sedimentation techniques, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for viral detection. Of the 216 soil and 16 feces samples, 49% (106/216) and 12% (2/16) were positivefor nematodes larvae, respectively, through sedimentation techniques. Toxocara spp eggs were found in one soil sample and one feces sample, Trichuris spp eggs were found in only one feces sample and Hookworms eggs were found in four soil samples. After reconstruction work in the streets near the park, 30% (64/216) of the samples were positive for Human Mastadenovirus C (HAdV-C), 1.4% (3/216) for HAdV-E and 0.4% (1/216) for Canine Mastadenovirus A (CAdV-A). The parasitic forms found in this study have demonstrated that the contamination of the park's soil pose a threat to human and animal health. This was the first study to report the presence of HAdVs and CAdVs in soil samples. labels: #Ancylostomatoidea#Animals#Dogs#Feces#Humans#Mastadenovirus#Parks, Recreational#Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction#Soil#Soil Microbiology#Toxocara"
b'PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of implants inserted in maxillary sinuses augmented with 100% anorganic bovine bone (ABB) grafts versus mixed with 50% ABB and 50% autologous bone graft using a lateral window approach.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a randomised controlled trial of parallel groups. Patients in need of an implant-supported prosthesis in maxillary posterior areas, with a residual alveolar bone height ranging between 0 and 4 mm, were recruited for lateral sinus grafting and implant placement. Patients were randomly allocated to receive two different graft materials according to a parallel group design: group A was grafted with 50% ABB and 50% autogenous bone; group B was grafted with 100% ABB. After 7 months, tapered implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 20 and 45 Ncm. Three months later implants were loaded with screw-retained temporary crowns. Definitive crowns were delivered after 3 months. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis survival rates, complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, probing pocket depths (PPDs) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Clinical data were collected at definitive prosthesis delivery, and 1, 2 and 5 years after definitive loading.RESULTS: Thirty-two consecutive patients were treated with 32 sinus elevation procedures (16 group A, 16 group B). A total of 46 implants were inserted. One patient (with two implants) dropped out in group A, and two patients (with three implants) dropped out in group B. No implant/crown failed by the end of the study. Three complications (one sinus membrane perforation and two chipping of the ceramic) were observed in three patients in group A, versus none in group B (relative risk was 0.81; 95% CI 0.64-1.03; P = 0.225). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean marginal bone loss was 1.18 \\xc2\\xb1 0.50 mm (95% CI 0.95-1.45 mm) in group A and 1.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 0.97-1.43 mm) in group B, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups (difference 0.11 \\xc2\\xb1 0.22 mm; 95% CI -0.06-0.16 mm; P = 0.586). At the 5-year follow-up, the mean marginal bone loss was 1.37 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 1.13-1.86 mm) in group A and 1.42 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 mm (95% CI 1.17-1.90 mm) in group B (difference 0.15 \\xc2\\xb1 0.08 mm; 95% CI 0.10-0.22 mm; P = 0.426). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean PPD value was 2.70 \\xc2\\xb1 0.39 mm for group A and 2.54 \\xc2\\xb1 0.66 mm for group B, with no statistically significant difference between groups (difference 0.17 \\xc2\\xb1 0.39 mm; 95% CI 0.06-0.32 mm; P = 0.456). At the 5-year follow-up, the mean PPD value was 3.20 \\xc2\\xb1 0.44 mm for group A and 3.32 \\xc2\\xb1 0.49 mm for group B (difference 0.12 \\xc2\\xb1 0.43 mm; 95% CI 0.02-0.22 mm; P = 0.672). At the 2-year follow-up, the mean BOP value was 1.21 \\xc2\\xb1 0.79 for group A and 1.28 \\xc2\\xb1 0.68 for group B (difference 0.06 \\xc2\\xb1 0.49; 95% CI -0.23-0.25; P = 0.297), and at the 5-year follow-up, the mean BOP value was 1.77 \\xc2\\xb1 0.62 for group A and 1.91 \\xc2\\xb1 0.48 for group B (difference: 0.14 \\xc2\\xb1 0.51; 95% CI -0.05-0.33; P = 0.492).CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the present data confirm similar clinical outcomes of implants inserted in sinuses grafted with ABB versus implants inserted in sinuses grafted with mixed 50% ABB and 50% autologous bone. labels: #Animals#Bone Transplantation#Cattle#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis Design#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Dental Restoration Failure#Humans#Maxillary Sinus'
b'OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous, radiation-free registration of the teeth and the upper and lower jaw positions in relation to the extraoral soft tissue could improve treatment planning and documentation. The purpose of this study is to describe a workflow to solve this form of registration and surface acquisition with a mobile device.METHODS: Facial scans of ten healthy participants were taken using a blue-light LED 3D scanner (Artec\\xc2\\xae Space Spider; Artec\\xc2\\xae Group; Luxembourg). An impression of the maxillary dentoalveolar arch was taken simultaneously to the 3D photo using a modified impression tray with two different extraoral registration geometries (sphere vs. cross). Following, an impression of the mandibular dentoalveolar arch was taken once. Both impressions were scanned with the 3D scanner. All resulting standard tesselation language (.stl) files of the geometries were compared to the original, virtual .stl files and the root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated for each surface (Artec Studio 13 Professional ?\\xe2\\x80\\x8964; Artec\\xc2\\xae Group; Luxembourg) to determine which geometry serves as a better reference for intra-extraoral registration.RESULTS: The RMSE between the original geometries and the scanned counterfeits were statistically lower for spherical geometries (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89<\\xe2\\x80\\x890.008). Once scanned and aligned, both geometries enabled an alignment of the intra- and extraoral scan. However, the spherical geometries showed virtually better results without significance (p\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.70).CONCLUSIONS: The presented study provides a radiation-free solution for simultaneous dentoalveolar correlations in relation to the extraoral soft tissue. Spherical geometries achieved more precise and easier intra-extraoral alignments using the applied mobile 3D scanner and workflow. labels: #Dental Impression Technique#Dental Models#Face#Imaging, Three-Dimensional#Maxilla#Photography'

Results: The risk of GBS was higher for males than females in rural and urban areas and the median age was 49 and 48 years, respectively. Seasonal clustering in winter and spring was noted in both rural and urban areas, and the seasonal trend was more markedly in rural areas, but the differences showed no statistical significance. There were 70.37% of patients in rural areas and 73.69% in urban areas who had antecedent respiratory infection. The median time from onset to nadir was 7 days, and Hughes Disability Scale at admission, nadir and discharge were (2.95\\xc2\\xb11.10 vs 2.84\\xc2\\xb11.15), (3.25\\xc2\\xb11.11 vs 3.14\\xc2\\xb11.21), (2.02\\xc2\\xb11.24 vs 2.00\\xc2\\xb11.31) in rural and urban areas respectively. Albuminocytologic dissociation was present in 84.34% of patients in rural areas and 84.62% of cases in urban areas. There were 8.65% and 10.94% of cases in rural and urban areas who required mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, respectively. Demyelinating GBS accounted for 53.29% and 48.77%, respectively, in patients with findings of nerve conduction studies available in rural and urban areas. Conclusions: GBS in rural areas of southern China showed male predominance and a peak of spring and winter occurrence, with respiratory infection as the predominated preceding events and demyelinating GBS being main clinical subtype. Winter and spring showed a higher incidence of GBS in rural and urban areas. There were no significant differences of sex, age, preceding events, season trend, progression of disease, clinical subtypes and cerebrospinal fluid investigations in GBS patients between rural and urban areas. labels: #China#Female#Guillain-Barre Syndrome#Hospitalization#Humans#Incidence#Male#Retrospective Studies'
b'A bioassay battery-integrated index was applied to different soils sampled from a former coke factory, with the aim to evaluate the discriminating capacity of the Ecoscore system (ES) to assess the environmental hazard of PAH-polluted soils. Two soils from a former coke factory, polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were evaluated for their ecotoxicity to terrestrial and aquatic organisms and their genotoxicity. These soils have been already presented in a previous paper but data have been reanalyzed for the present article in an endeavor to standardize the ES. One soil was sampled in the untreated site and the second underwent a windrow treatment. While these soils had a similar total concentrations of US-EPA 16PAHs (around 3000\\xc2\\xa0mg\\xc2\\xa0kg-1), different ecoscores were obtained when subjected to a set of solid- and liquid-phase bioassays measuring acute, chronic, and genotoxic effects. The total PAH content of the soil is not a pertinent parameter to assess soil pollution hazards contrary to the ES. ES is a robust method to classify soils according to their toxicity level. Four levels of toxicity have been defined: no (ecoscore\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00), weak (0\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0ecoscore ?33), moderate (33\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0ecoscore ?67), and strong toxicity (67\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0ecoscore\\xc2\\xa0?\\xc2\\xa0100). The combination of chemical and toxicological data highlights the relationship between three-ring PAHs and acute ecotoxicity. Conversely, chronic effects of water extracts on algal growth could be explained by high molecular weight PAHs, such as five- and six-ring PAHs. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different nose types on the perception of facial aesthetics following camouflage treatment and orthognathic surgery for skeletal class II female patients.METHODS: A pre-treatment profile photograph of a skeletal class II adult patient was selected from the department archive. Two constructed photographs were created to represent orthognathic surgery and camouflage treatments with the aid of computer software. A total of 18 constructed images was composed using three profiles (pre-treatment, post-camouflage, and post-orthognathic surgery) and six nose types. These photographs were shown to the three groups (orthodontists, plastic surgeons, and lay people), and they were asked to assign an attractiveness score to each photo ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the least attractive and 100 indicating the most attractive.RESULTS: For the convex nose profiles, anterior movement of the mandible obtained by orthognathic surgery did not result in a significant change in the scores given by the lay people. When surgical or camouflage treatment was not implemented and, instead, just rhinoplasty was performed for these profiles, there was a significant increase in the aesthetic scores given by all groups. For the straight nose profiles, orthognathic surgery increased the attractiveness scores given by all groups. Furthermore, for all the profiles, extraction treatment did not affect the aesthetic scores given by any of the groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The lay people perceived that having a convex-bridged nose was a bigger problem than having a retrognathic profile. Overall, in terms of skeletal and dental orthodontic treatments, nose shape should be considered during the treatment planning process. labels: #Adult#Esthetics, Dental#Face#Female#Humans#Nose#Orthognathic Surgery#Orthognathic Surgical Procedures'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 152 children with neonatal bacterial meningitis. According to their prognosis, they were divided into a good prognosis group with 122 children and a poor prognosis group with 30 children. The two groups were compared in terms of general status, initial symptoms, and laboratory findings, and the risk factors for poor prognosis were analyzed.RESULTS: Compared with the good prognosis group, the poor prognosis group had a significantly higher proportion of children with a very low birth weight, a peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) of <5?109/L or >20?109/L, a C-reactive protein level of >50\\xe2\\x80\\x85mg/L, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) WBC of >500?106/L, a CSF glucose level of <1\\xe2\\x80\\x85mmol/L, or a CSF protein level of >2\\xe2\\x80\\x85g/L, as well as significantly higher positive rates of blood culture and/or CSF culture, Gram-positive bacteria, and Streptococcus agalactiae (P<0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a CSF glucose level of <1\\xe2\\x80\\x85mmol/L and a CSF protein level of >2\\xe2\\x80\\x85g/L were independent risk factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis.CONCLUSIONS: A CSF glucose level of <1\\xe2\\x80\\x85mmol/L and a CSF protein level of >2\\xe2\\x80\\x85g/L are risk factors for poor prognosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis. labels: #Child#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Leukocyte Count#Meningitis, Bacterial#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Risk Factors'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of "Buqi Yixue "needling on clinical symptoms, neurological function and nerve conduction velocity in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.METHODS: Eighty-six patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy numbness and pain were equally randomized into control group and treatment group. The patients of the control group received basic treatment and oral administration of Cilostazol (50 mg/time, 2 times/d) and Epalrestat (50 mg/time, 3 times/d). The patients of the treatment group received acupuncture stimulation of Danzhong (CV17), Qihai (CV6), Pishu (BL20), Quchi (LI11), etc., for 30 min, once every day, on the basic treatment. The treatment was conducted for 8 successive weeks. The scores of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptoms, Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were detected before and after the treatment.RESULTS: After the treatment, the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS were considerably decreased (P<0.05), and the NCV was significantly increased (P<0.05) in both groups compared with those of their own pre-treatment. The the-rapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in lowering the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS, and in up-regulating the NCV (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: "Buqi Yixue" needling is effective in improving clinical symptoms and increasing NCV in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Arteries#Diabetes Mellitus#Diabetic Neuropathies#Humans#Medicine, Chinese Traditional#Neural Conduction'
b'Objective: To explore the screening efficiency of colorectal cancer in urban residents of Kunming, China. Methods: Using the method of cluster sampling, from October 2014 to October 2017, residents of the three jurisdictions of Xishan, Guandu and Chenggong Districts of Kunming city were investigated. The inclusion criteria: (1) resident (for more than 3 years) population of Kunming city aged 40-74 years old; (2) voluntarily participating and receiving colonoscopy; (3) signing informed consent. Based on the Harvard Cancer Risk Index, the questionnaire was built on the consensus of more than 20 years of common cancer epidemiology in China. Through the consensus reached by the multidisciplinary expert panel discussion, a comprehensive evaluation system for cancer risk in China was designed. The high-risk group of colorectal cancer was determined by preliminary screening of the questionnaire, and a free colonoscopy was performed for the appointment to the gastrointestinal endoscopy department of the Yunnan Cancer Hospital. All polypoid lesions and ulcers found by colonoscopy must be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. \\xc3\\xb7(2) test or Fisher exact probability method was used to compare the detection of colorectal cancer in 4 groups of 40-49 years old, 50-59 years old, 60-69 years old, and ?70-years old. Detection of colonoscopy, compliance, pathological examination, pathological diagnosis, and morbidity of colorectal cancer were analyzed. Results: A total of 127 960 people from 40 to 74 years old of urban residents in Kunming city participated in the preliminary screening of the questionnaire, including 59 748 (46.7%) males and 68 212 females (53.3%) with mean age of (53.6\\xc2\\xb18.6) years old. The 40-49 years old group had the largest number of participants (48 044, 37.5%), followed by the groups of 50-59 years old (42 473, 33.2%), 60-69 years old (34 111, 26.7%), and ?70 years old (3332, 2.6%). Till October 2017, a total of 14 971 people were screened as at high risk of colorectal cancer, with the high-risk detection rate of 11.7%, and the high-risk detection rate of women was significantly higher than that of men [13.4% (9 109/68 212) vs. 9.8% (5 862/59 748), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=386.947, P<0.001]. The highest high-risk detection rate was in the 50-59 years group in both gender [men: 11.1% (2202/19 831), women: 15.3% (3034/22 642)]. A total of 3449 people among the high-risk population received colonoscopy examination. The compliance rate of colonoscopy was 23.0% (3449/14 971), and the male compliance rate was 19.8% (1162/5862), which was significantly lower than that of females [25.1% (2287/9109), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=56.175, P<0.001]. The highest compliance was observed in the 50-59 years group [25.4% (1438/5668)], followed by 40-49 years and 60-69 year group [22.1%(1091/4931) and 22.0%(891/4048), respectively], and the compliance of ?70 years old group was the lowest [9.0% (29/324)]. Colonoscopy examination revealed 606 cases with lesions, the detection rate of lesions was 17.6%, and the male detection rate was significantly higher than that of females [26.9% (313/1162) vs. 12.8% (293/2287), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=106.140, P<0.001]. The detection rate of lesions increased with age [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 10.9% (119/1091), 17.5% (252/1438), 25.0% (223/891) and 41.4% (12/29), respectively, \\xc3\\xb7(2)=79.010, P<0.001]. A total of 584 cases underwent endoscopic excision and pathological diagnosis, and 465 cases (13.5%) of precancerous lesions were detected. The prevalence of precancerous lesions in men was higher than that in women [21.3% (247/1162) vs. 9.5% (218/2287), \\xc3\\xb7(2)=90.801, P<0.001], the precancerous lesion detection rate increased with age [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 8.0% (87/1091), 14.3% (206/1438), 18.1% (161/891) and 37.9% (11/29); \\xc3\\xb7(2)=58.109, P<0.001]. A total of 4 patients with colorectal cancer were detected, including 3 males and 1 female. The detection rate of male colorectal cancer was 258.2/100 000, and the female was 43.7/100 000, whose difference was not statistically significant (\\xc3\\xb7(2)=1.488, P=0.223). There was no significant difference in the detection rate of colorectal cancer among 4 age groups [40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ?70: 91.7/100 000 (1/1091), 69.5/100 000 (1/1438), 224.5/100 000 (2/891) and 0, respectively, P=0.696]. Conclusions: Screening for colorectal cancer is an important measure to control the onset and death of colorectal cancer. Through the questionnaire risk assessment plus colonoscopy, two-step screening method can improve the screening efficiency and greatly reduce the screening cost. labels: #Adult#Aged#China#Colonoscopy#Colorectal Neoplasms#Early Detection of Cancer#Female#Humans#Male#Mass Screening#Middle Aged#Risk Assessment#Urban Population'
b'The Australian native marine fish species, silver sweep Scorpis lineolata, is susceptible to the megalocytivirus Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (strain DGIV-10) obtained from a freshwater ornamental fish, dwarf gourami Trichogaster lalius. This was demonstrated by direct inoculation and through cohabitation. Transmission by cohabitation was also demonstrated from inoculated freshwater Murray cod Maccullochella peelii to euryhaline Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata and to marine silver sweep. The virus was also transmitted from infected marine silver sweep to euryhaline Australian bass and then to freshwater Murray cod. This study is the first to demonstrate the virulence of a megalocytivirus derived from ornamental fish in an Australian marine species and the first to show a feasible pathway for the exchange of megalocytiviruses between freshwater and marine finfish hosts. These results demonstrate that megalocytiviruses from freshwater ornamental fish have the potential to spread to diverse aquatic environments. labels: #Animals#Australia#DNA Virus Infections#Fish Diseases#Fresh Water#Iridoviridae#Phylogeny'
b'The interest of food industry to merchandise natural astaxanthin is growing up. However, it confronts scientific and technological challenges mainly related to its poor water solubility and chemical instability. Here, we present a new quick and efficient green process to simultaneously extract, encapsulate and stabilize astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis. The process is based on the hitherto unexplored combination of supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS), nanostructured liquids generated from amphiphiles through sequential self-assembly and coacervation, and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). These novel nanosystems were characterized by means of dynamic light scattering, AFM and cryoSEM, revealing spherical particles of ?100\\xe2\\x80\\xafnm. Their antioxidant activity was measured by ORAC (20.6\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf3.9\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc3\\xacM TE) and \\xc3\\xa1-TEAC (2.92\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf0.58\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb5M \\xc3\\xa1-TE) assays and their in vitro capacity to inhibit ROS by DHE probe. Results showed that the SUPRAS-NLCs proposed yield high extraction and encapsulation efficiencies (71\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb1\\xe2\\x80\\xaf4%) in combination with a remarkable time stability (180\\xe2\\x80\\xafd, 4\\xe2\\x80\\xaf\\xc2\\xb0C). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Aedes aegypti mosquitos are widespread vectors of several diseases and their control is of primary importance for biological and environmental reasons, and novel safe insecticides are highly desirable. An eco-friendly photosensitizing magnetic nanocarrier with larvicidal effects on Aedes aegypti was proposed. The innovative core-shell hybrid nanomaterial was synthesized by combining peculiar magnetic nanoparticles (called Surface Active Maghemite Nanoparticles - SAMNs, the core) and chlorin-e6 as photosensitizer (constituting the shell) via self-assembly in water. The hybrid nanomaterial (SAMN@chlorin) was extensively characterized and tested for the photocidal activity on larvae of Aedes aegypti. The SAMN@chlorin core-shell nanohybrid did not present any toxic effect in the dark, but, upon light exposure, showed a higher photocidal activity than free chlorin-e6. Moreover, the eco-toxicity of SAMN@chlorin was determined in adults and neonates of Daphnia magna, where delayed toxicity was observed only after prolonged (?4\\xe2\\x80\\xafh) exposure to intense light, on the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and on the duckweed Lemna minor on which no adverse effects were observed. The high colloidal stability, the physico-chemical robustness and the magnetic drivability of the core-shell SAMN@chlorin nanohybrid, accompanied by the high photocidal activity on Aedes aegypti larvae and reduced environmental concerns, can be proposed as a safe alternative to conventional insecticides. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'We examined the response of algal cells to laboratory-induced cadmium stress in terms of physiological activity, autonomous features (motility and fluorescence), adhesion dynamics, nanomechanical properties, and protein expression by employing a multimethod approach. We develop a methodology based on the generalized mathematical model to predict free cadmium concentrations in culture. We used algal cells of Dunaliella tertiolecta, which are widespread in marine and freshwater systems, as a model organism. Cell adaptation to cadmium stress is manifested through cell shape deterioration, slower motility, and an increase of physiological activity. No significant change in growth dynamics showed how cells adapt to stress by increasing active surface area against toxic cadmium in the culture. It was accompanied by an increase in green fluorescence (most likely associated with cadmium vesicular transport and/or beta-carotene production), while no change was observed in the red endogenous fluorescence (associated with chlorophyll). To maintain the same rate of chlorophyll emission, the cell adaptation response was manifested through increased expression of the identified chlorophyll-binding protein(s) that are important for photosynthesis. Since production of these proteins represents cell defence mechanisms, they may also signal the presence of toxic metal in seawater. Protein expression affects the cell surface properties and, therefore, the dynamics of the adhesion process. Cells behave stiffer under stress with cadmium, and thus, the initial attachment and deformation are slower. Physicochemical and structural characterizations of algal cell surfaces are of key importance to interpret, rationalize, and predict the behaviour and fate of the cell under stress in vivo. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Panulirus argus virus 1 (PaV1) affects wild populations of Caribbean spiny lobsters. PaV1 can be lethal but shows predilection for juvenile lobsters. Because P. argus is one of the most valuable fisheries around the wider Caribbean region, monitoring disease prevalence in local populations is desirable. Diseased lobsters are easily recognized by their milky hemolymph, but this sign only becomes evident in advanced stages of infection. Other methods have been developed to detect PaV1, but are less practical for long-term monitoring of patterns of infection in populations. A previous study estimated the validity measures (sensitivity and specificity) of detection of PaV1 infection by observed clinical signs against endpoint PCR assays, using a representative sample of lobsters comprising mainly subadults and adults from a commercial fishing area. In the present study, these validity measures were estimated in a similar manner for a different population comprising mainly juveniles from a protected nursery area. We obtained virtually the same sensitivity and specificity values (0.48 and 1, respectively) for observed clinical signs as in the previous study (0.51 and 1, respectively), confirming the validity of applying a simple 2? correction factor to monitor the patterns of PaV1 infection over time based on more easily conducted visual assessments of a representative sample of the population. labels: #Animals#Fisheries#Hemolymph#Palinuridae#Polymerase Chain Reaction'
b'Genomes of photoautotrophic organisms containing type I photosynthetic reaction center were searched for the rnf genes encoding Na+-translocating ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase (RNF). These genes were absent in heliobacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, and plants; however, genomes of many green sulfur bacteria (especially marine ones) were found to contain the full rnf operon. Analysis of RNA isolated from the marine green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeovibrioides revealed a high level of rnf expression. It was found that the activity of Na+-dependent flavodoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase detected in the membrane fraction of Chl. phaeovibrioides was absent in the membrane fraction of the freshwater green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum limnaeum, which is closely related to Chl. phaeovibrioides but whose genome lacks the rnf genes. Illumination of the membrane fraction of Chl. phaeovibrioides but not of Cba. limnaeum resulted in the light-induced NAD+ reduction. Based on the obtained data, we concluded that in some green sulfur bacteria, RNF may be involved in the NADH formation that should increase the efficiency of light energy conservation in these microorganisms and can serve as the first example of the use of Na+ energetics in photosynthetic electron transport chains. labels: #Bacterial Proteins#Chlorobi#Electron Transport#Light#NAD#Oxidoreductases#Photosynthesis#Recombinant Proteins'
b'AIM: The colour stability of the silicone is essential for the longevity of facial prostheses. This in vitro study investigates the colour degradation of two different skin shade silicones moulded in Type II and Type III dental stone.METHODS & MATERIALS: Two different types of dental stone were used to fabricate 168 silicone samples (n=42 for each group) using M511 maxillofacial silicone, which was coloured with Spectromatch Procolourants. The polymerisation was carried out at 85\\xc2\\xb0C 1.5 hours. A spectrophotometer was used to record the colour differences (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85) of each group before and after polymerisation. The CIEL*a*b* formula was used to obtain the measurements and a one-way ANOVA was carried out for the statistical analysis of the data.RESULTS: There is a statistically significant colour difference (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85) for all groups. For the Afro-Caribbean skin tone, Type III dental stone demonstrated the greatest colour change (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 = 4.36), whereas, for the Caucasian skin tone, it was the Type II dental stone (\\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 = 2.21).CONCLUSION: This study showed that regardless of the investing material, the colour of the silicone lightens after polymerisation. Both types of dental stone resulted in visible colour changes, with a \\xc3\\x84\\xc3\\x85 ranging from 1.64 - 4.36. labels: #Caribbean Region#Color#Materials Testing#Maxillofacial Prosthesis#Silicone Elastomers#Skin Pigmentation'
b'An actinomycete strain, TKZ-21T, was isolated from a freshwater alga (Chetophoraceae) collected from the Takizawa River, Yamanashi, Japan, and examined using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Cells were Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-sporulating, motile, and coccoid or short rod-shaped. The strain grew in the presence of 0-4\\xe2\\x80\\x8a% (w/v) NaCl, between pH 6-9.4, and over a temperature range of 15-40\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb0C, with optimum growth at 30\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb0C. The peptidoglycan type of strain TKZ-21T was A4\\xc3\\xa2, containing l-ornithine as diagnostic diamino acid and d-glutamic acid as the interpeptide bridge. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H4). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, ninhydrin-positive glycolipid, and unidentified phospholipids. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15\\xe2\\x80\\x8a:\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0 and anteiso-C17\\xe2\\x80\\x8a:\\xe2\\x80\\x8a0, and the DNA G+C\\xe2\\x80\\x89content was 75.6\\xe2\\x80\\x89mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain TKZ-21T was closely related to Cellulomonas fimi (98.5\\xe2\\x80\\x8a% sequence similarity) and Cellulomonas biazotea (98.3\\xe2\\x80\\x8a%). The genome orthoANI value between strain TKZ-21T and C. biazotea and C. fimi were 84.7 and 84.2\\xe2\\x80\\x8a%, respectively. On the basis of fatty acid and MALDI-TOF MS profile analysis, phylogenetic analyses, genomic analysis, and phenotypic data, it is proposed that the isolate be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Cellulomonas, with the name Cellulomonas algicola sp. nov.

b'Medical Daily Routine in the Tropics: A Case-Based Overview Abstract. When we speak about \\xc2\\xabmedicine in the tropics\\xc2\\xbb it is malaria epidemics, diarrheal diseases and worm infections that come to mind. A lesser-known fact is the impact of the new epidemic of non-communicable diseases, which are currently responsible for about half of all deaths occurring in the tropical world regions. Changing demographic, social and economic factors are the drivers for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. The observed increase in non-communicable diseases coupled with the persistence of classic infectious tropical diseases creates a double medical burden and presents a great challenge in these low-resource settings. labels: #Communicable Diseases#Diabetes Mellitus#Epidemics#Humans'
b"Objective: To study and analyze the incidence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in women who underwent cesarean section. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. The clinical data of the women who underwent regular antepartum examination and cesarean delivery in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2019 to June 2019 were collected, including the cervical dilatation. The incidence of POP was analyzed. Results: (1) A total of 345 women met the inclusion criteria, with cervical dilatation of 0-10 cm before cesarean section, the cervix was not dilatated in 58.6% (202/345) of the women, and the cervix was fully dilatated in 2.9% (10/345) of the women. There were 109 cases of POP stage ? or above, 13 cases of POP stage ?, and no stage ? or ?. The incidence of POP was 31.6% (109/345). (2) Statistical analysis showed that the cervical dilatation of the POP group was significantly larger than that of the non-prolapse group (median: 1.0 vs 0 cm;Z=-2.227, P=0.026). The risk of POP of vaginal trial-birth transfer to cesarean section was higher than that of elective cesarean section [42.4% (36/85) vs 28.1% (73/260), P=0.014]. However, the further analysis of Spearman correlation between cervical dilatation, elective cesarean section and POP, as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the correlation and prediction value were poor. Conclusion: Elective cesarean section has a certain protective effect on postpartum prolapse, but the protective effect of vaginal trial-birth transfer to cesarean section on pelvic floor is weakened. labels: #Cesarean Section#Cross-Sectional Studies#Delivery, Obstetric#Female#Humans#Pelvic Organ Prolapse#Postpartum Period#Pregnancy"
b'Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the causative bacterium of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. This bacterium secretes protein toxins whose genes are encoded in an auto-transmissible plasmid called pVA1. The presence of this plasmid in V. parahaemolyticus is determinant for disease development. Its propagation is not only linked to bacterial colonisation capacity but also to horizontal gene transfer mechanisms. Nevertheless, the active uptake of plasmid, which is known as natural genetic transformation (NGT), has not yet been proposed as a possible acquisition mechanism of the pVA1 plasmid among Vibrio species. Previous studies suggest that some Vibrio species have the ability to undergo NGT in the presence of chitin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the induction of NGT mediated by chitin in V. parahaemolyticus (ATCC-17802) through its ability to incorporate and express the pVA1 plasmid. The results showed that a reference strain that does not initially contain the plasmid can incorporate the plasmid under the appropriate transformation conditions, and cause mortality in white shrimp similar to that observed for pathogenic strains isolated from infectious outbreaks. Given the management and conditions of a shrimp farm with large amounts of chitinous exoskeletons, it is feasible that NGT could be a possible acquisition mechanism of plasmid pVA1 among Vibrio species, turning a non-causative strain of V. parahaemolyticus into a causative strain. With this study, we have expanded the knowledge of the pathogenesis process mediated by NGT and the understanding of the possible propagation mechanisms of emerging diseases in the aquaculture sector. labels: #Animals#Aquaculture#Penaeidae#Plasmids#Transformation, Genetic#Vibrio parahaemolyticus'
b'Objective: To assess clinical features and treatment outcomes in immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Methods: Sixty-two patients with PCNSL who attended Guangdong General Hospital between January 1998 and January 2012 were included. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival methodology and statistical significance of continuous was assessed via the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The median age of the patient cohort was 56 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.14?1.00. The common presentations were increased intracranial pressure symptoms and neuron damage. Performance status of 54 (54/62, 87.1%) patients were the international prognostic index (IPI) 0-2. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (57/62, 91.9%) was most common, and the rest were T-cell lymphoma (4/62,6.4%) and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (1/62, 1.6%). In the series, 32 patients (32/62, 51.6%) had multiple lesions. Involvement of deep structures was found in 30 (30/62, 48.4%) patients. An elevated serum LDH level was detected in 19 (19/62, 30.6%) patients and the Ki-67 index was ?90% in 38 (38/62, 61.3%) patients. Univariate analysis showed patients who were female, age<60 years, had WHO Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status grade 0-2, single lesion, absence of deep structures involvement and normal LDH level showed better 2-year survival rate and longer median survival time. Significance was only seen in the normal LDH level group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that radical surgery only and Rituximab+ high-dose of methotrexate+ whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) were independent prognostic indicators in PCNSL patients (P<0.05). Conclusions: PCNSL is a rare but aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Patients treated with high-dose of methotrexate combining with rituximab, followed by WBRT have a better prognosis and longer survival time, and thus these could probably be a promising treatment. labels: #Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols#Central Nervous System Neoplasms#Female#Humans#Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse#Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin#Male#Middle Aged#Prognosis#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome'
b'Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the role of extended involved-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients with early stage extranodal nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) in a single center, and to explore the long-term effect of risk-adaptive therapy. Methods: Among 238 patients with early stage NKTCL, there were 191 in high-risk group [any risk factor of age > 60, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score?2, primary tumor invasion, or Ann Arbor stage ?] and 47 in low-risk group (no risk factor). A total of 204 patients received radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy, 15 received radiotherapy alone and 19 received chemotherapy alone. One-hundred and eighty-six patients had radiotherapy at a dose ?50 Gy and 159 patients received chemotherapy with asparaginase-based regimen. Results: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and progression- free survival (PFS)rate of all patients were 66.2% and 57.5%. Five-year OS and PFS rates in low-risk group were 91.8% and 88.0%, while 59.3% and 49.3% in high-risk group. The survival of patients in low-risk group were better than those in high-risk group (both P<0.001). The five-year OS rate in combined therapy group, radiotherapy group and chemotherapy group were 71.7%, 52.3% and 20.7%, respectively (P<0.001). The five-year PFS rate were 63.5%, 23.3% and 24.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Among 219 patients receiving radiotherapy, the 5-year OS and PFS rate of patients with primary site radiotherapy dose ? 50 Gy were 72.6% and 66.1%, higher than those of patients with a dose <50 Gy (57.3% and 30.9%, respectively; P=0.031, P<0.001). In the high-risk group, the 5-year OS and PFS rate of the patients who received radiotherapy combined with more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy were 66.5% and 62.6%, higher than those of patients received less than 4 cycles of chemotherapy (56.7% and 46.4%, P=0.045 and 0.020, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis showed that ECOG score (HR=2.208, P=0.001), primary site (HR=4.887, P<0.001), primary tumor invasion (HR=3.265, P=0.001) and radiation dose (HR=1.895, P=0.011) were independent factors of OS in early NKTCL patients. Conclusion: Extended-involved field IMRT with radiation dose more than 50 Gy was the main treatment for patients with early stage NKTCL. Radiotherapy combined with adequate cycle chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis of high-risk patients. labels: #Combined Modality Therapy#Disease-Free Survival#Drug Therapy#Humans#Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell#Neoplasm Staging#Prognosis#Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated#Risk Factors#Survival Rate'
b'The unicellular green alga Haematococcus pluvialis accumulates large amounts of the red ketocarotenoid astaxanthin to protect against environmental stresses. Haematococcus cells that accumulate astaxanthin in the central part (green-red cyst cells) respond rapidly to intense light by distributing astaxanthin diffusively to the peripheral part of the cell within 10\\xe2\\x80\\x89min after irradiation. This response is reversible: when astaxanthin-diffused cells were placed in the dark, astaxanthin was redistributed to the center of the cell. Although Haematococcus possesses several pigments other that astaxanthin, the subcellular distribution and content of each pigment remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the subcellular dynamics and localization of major pigments such as astaxanthin, \\xc3\\xa2-carotene, lutein, and chlorophylls under light irradiation using time-lapse and label-free hyperspectral imaging analysis. Fluorescence microscopy and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy showed that, preceding/following exposure to light, astaxanthin colocalized with lipid droplets, which moved from the center to the periphery through pathways in a chloroplast. This study revealed that photoresponse dynamics differed between astaxanthin and other pigments (chlorophylls, lutein, and \\xc3\\xa2-carotene), and that only astaxanthin freely migrates from the center to the periphery of the cell through a large, spherical, cytoplasm-encapsulating chloroplast as a lipid droplet. We consider this to be the Haematococcus light-protection mechanism. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The solid-state photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) effect has been studied in a quinone-depleted uniformly (u-)13C,15N-labeled photosynthetic reaction center (RC) protein from purple bacterium Rhodobacter (R.) sphaeroides wild type (WT). As a method for investigation, solid-state 15N NMR under magic-angle spinning (MAS) is applied under both continuous illumination (steady state) and nanosecond-laser flashes (time-resolved). While all previous 15N photo-CIDNP MAS NMR studies on the purple bacterial RC used the carotenoid-less mutant R26, this is the first using WT samples. The absence of further photo-CIDNP mechanisms (compared to R26) and various couplings (compared to 13C NMR experiments on 13C-labeled samples) allows the simplification of the spin-system. We report 15N signals of the three cofactors forming the spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) and, based on density-functional theory calculations, their assignment. The simulation of photo-CIDNP intensities and time-resolved 15N photo-CIDNP MAS NMR data matches well to the frame of the mechanistic interpretation. Three spin-chemical processes, namely, radical pair mechanism, three spin mixing, and differential decay, generate emissive (negative) 15N polarization in the singlet decay channel and absorptive (positive) polarization in the triplet decay channel of the SCRP. The absorptive 15N polarization of the triplet decay channel is transiently obscured during the lifetime of the triplet state of the carotenoid (3Car); therefore, the observed 15N signals are strongly emissive. Upon decay of 3Car, the transiently obscured polarization becomes visible by reducing the excess of emissive polarization. After the decline of 3Car, the remaining nuclear hyperpolarization decays with nuclear T1 relaxation kinetics. labels: #Models, Molecular#Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular#Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins#Protein Conformation#Rhodobacter sphaeroides'
b'OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact olanzapine (OLA) on the hippocampal neuron of model rats with depression.METHODS: Rats were divided into five groups: control, chronic unpredicted stress (CUS), OAL (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg), si-Atg5, and OAL (2 mg/kg)+si-Atg5. Open field and sucrose preference tests were performed to evaluate rat behaviors. Cell apoptosis was detected with Tunnel. The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1\\xc3\\xa2 and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. The expressions of cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-9, LC3, Beclin1, P62, NLRP3 and cleaved Caspase-1 were measured by Western blot.RESULTS: OAL (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) increased the total moving distance, sucrose consumption and preference rate of CUS rats, and decreased serum IL-18, cell apoptosis and the expressions of cleaved Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-1 and NLRP3 in the CA3 region of hippocampus. Although OAL (1, 2 mg/kg) decreased the expression of cleaved Caspase-3 and serum IL-1\\xc3\\xa2, OAL (0.5 mg/kg) showed no detectable effects. Si-Atg5 decreased the total moving distance, sucrose consumption and preference rate of CUS rats, enhanced the expressions of cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-1 and NLRP3, and weakened the effect of OAL (2 mg/kg). OAL (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) also increased the LC3?/LC3? ratio and the expression of Beclin1 in the CA3 region of hippocampus. OAL (1, 2 mg/kg) reduced the expression of p62, but not when it was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg. Si-Atg5 reduced the LC3?/LC3? ratio and the expression of Beclin1, and weakened the function of OAL (2 mg/kg).CONCLUSION: OAL can protect the hippocampal neuron of CUS rats via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. labels: #Animals#Depression#Hippocampus#Inflammasomes#Interleukin-18#Interleukin-1beta#NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein#Neurons#Neuroprotective Agents#Olanzapine#Rats'
b'De-escalation strategy is the gradual transition of various complex, expensive, high-risk but effective treatments for critically ill patients to simple, safe, physiological but still effective ones. Chronic critical illness refers to patients suffering severe disease or surgical hit who later shift into a chronic state of relapse or even aggravation and stay in the intensive care unit for extended period. Risk factors for surgical related chronic critical illness include advanced age, malnutrition, multiple organ dysfunction and multiple hits. During the treatment of critically ill patients, the strategy of de-escalation therapy should always be implemented, including rational use of antibiotics, de-escalation of liquid therapy (i.e. de-resuscitation), timely removal of ventilator, rapid introduction and with drawal of continuous renal replacement measures, parenteral + enteral nutrition support therapy and timely cessation of sedation. labels: #Chronic Disease#Conservative Treatment#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Intensive Care Units#Withholding Treatment'
b'OBJECTIVE: To select and identify the bacterium which highly produces protease and \\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosidase from 72 strains of Shuidouchi from Sichuan, and to provide evidence for further research on its nutritional value and fermentation strain exploiting.METHODS: Casein degradation test and pNPG chemical test were applied respectively to detect the capacity to produce protease and \\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosidase of each strain. Characteristics of morphology, biochemistry, 16S rRNA and MALDI-TOF-MS were used to identify the fermentation strain, which genetic stability, curves of growth and enzyme producing were also obtained.RESULTS: The strain with the highest enzyme activity of \\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosidase (0.084 U/L) among the top 10 strains for producing protease was selected as the fermentation strain and was identified as Bacillus subtilis, which curves of growth and enzyme producing conformed as well. The result of genetic stability showed that capacity of enzyme producing was stable until the 10th generation.CONCLUSIONS: The fermentation strain which highly produced protease and \\xc3\\xa2-D-glucosidase was selected from 72 strains of shuidouchi from Sichuan and was identified as Bacillus subtilis. labels: #Bacillus subtilis#China#Fermentation#Fermented Foods and Beverages#Glucosidases#Peptide Hydrolases#RNA, Ribosomal, 16S#Soy Foods'
b'BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin is used as a functional nutraceutical and pigment in many food products. It is mostly exists in the form of a fatty acid ester in nature. However, no detailed descriptions are available concerning the stability and oral absorbability of astaxanthin esters. In the present study, the thermal stability and absorbability of astaxanthin esters from Haematococcus pluvialis were evaluated in comparison with free-form astaxanthin.RESULTS: The thermal stability of astaxanthin esters was found to be higher than that of free-form astaxantin. After gavage with astaxanthin esters, only free-form astaxanthin was detected in the digestive tract wall, blood plasma and liver, indicating that astaxanthin esters must be hydrolyzed to free-form astaxanthin in the gut before absorption. Furthermore, there was a considerable selective accumulation of different astaxanthin isomers in Balb/c mice, which selectivity decreased in the order: 13-cis\\xc2\\xa0>\\xe2\\x80\\x89all-trans\\xc2\\xa0>\\xc2\\xa09-cis. Accumulated astaxanthin was mainly distributed in the heart, liver, spleen, muscle and adipose tissue, although significant differences between tissues were observed.CONCLUSION: From the present study, it can be concluded that astaxanthin esters had a higher thermal stability and higher bioavailability than free-form astaxanthin. These results provide important evidence with respect to using astaxanthin esters as bioactive components to replace free-form astaxanthin in functional food products. \\xc2\\xa9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) case-based surveillance (CBS) systematically and continuously collects available demographic and health event data (sentinel events*) about persons with HIV infection from diagnosis and, if available, throughout routine clinical care until death, to characterize HIV epidemics and guide program improvement (1,2). Surveillance signals such as high viral load, mortality, or recent HIV infection can be used for rapid public health action. To date, few standardized assessments have been conducted to describe HIV CBS systems globally (3,4). For this assessment, a survey was disseminated during May-July 2019 to all U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported countries with CDC presence\\xe2\\x80\\xa0 (46) to describe CBS implementation and identify facilitators and barriers. Among the 39 (85%) countries that responded,\\xc2\\xa7 20 (51%) have implemented CBS, 15 (38%) were planning implementation, and four (10%)\\xc2\\xb6 had no plans for implementation. All countries with CBS reported capturing information at the point of diagnosis, and 85% captured sentinel event data. The most common characteristic (75% of implementation countries) that facilitated implementation was using a health information system for CBS. Barriers to CBS implementation included lack of country policies/guidance on mandated reporting of HIV and on CBS, lack of unique identifiers to match and deduplicate patient-level data, and lack of data security standards. Although most surveyed countries reported implementing or planning for implementation of CBS, these barriers need to be addressed to implement effective HIV CBS that can inform the national response to the HIV epidemic. labels: #Developing Countries#Global Health#HIV Infections#Humans#International Cooperation#Population Surveillance#United States"
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of scalp-acupuncture on the expression of pentraxin 3 (PTX3), Interleukin (IL)-1\\xc3\\xa2, zonula occludens-1(ZO-1) mRNA and Occludin mRNA in striatum in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (AICD) rats, so as to investigate its mechanisms underlying improvement of AICD.METHODS: Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly allocated to control, model, IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture groups (n=12 rats in each group). The AICD model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Rats of the IL-1Ra group and IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group received intraperitoneal injection of IL-1Ra (0.05 mg\\xc2\\xb7kg-1\\xc2\\xb7d-1), once daily for 6 days. Scalp acupuncture stimulation was applied to bilateral "Dingnieqianxiexian" (MS6) once daily for 6 days for rats in IL-1Ra+scalp-acupuncture group. Before and after intervention, the neurologic deficit score (NDS) was evalua-ted according to Longa\\\'s method. The expression of striatum PTX3 and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA in the striatum tissue were detected by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. The Evans Blue (EB) tracer method was used to monitor the degree of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage.RESULTS: Following modeling, the NDS, EB content and the expression of PTX3 and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 in the striatum tissue were significantly increased, and the ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression was considerably decreased in the model group compared with the control group (P<0.05). After the interventions and compared with the model group, the NDS, EB content in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the striatum ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression in both IL-1Ra and IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture groups, and PTX3 in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group were obviously up-regulated (P<0.05), and the expression of IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 was obviously down-regulated in the IL-1Ra+scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05) rather than in the IL-1Ra group (P>0.05). The effects of scalp acupuncture combined with IL-1Ra were obviously superior to that of IL-1Ra in down-regulating NDS, EB content and IL-1\\xc3\\xa2 expression level, and in up-regulating PTX3, ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA expression levels (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture can improve neurological function and reduce the degree of BBB injury in AICD rats, which may be associated with its function in up-regulating the expression of PTX3 and in promoting the expression of ZO-1 mRNA and Occludin mRNA. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#Animals#C-Reactive Protein#Cerebrovascular Disorders#Corpus Striatum#Male#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Scalp#Serum Amyloid P-Component'
b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin in the skin lesions of patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc) and its effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human epidermal keratinocytes.METHODS: The expression of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin, Snail1 and E-cadherin in the skin lesions sample of 45 SSc patients and normal skin sample from 20 healthy adults was detected with SP immunohistochemistry. HaCaT, the human epidermal keratinocytes, were treated with different concentrations of Wnt10b (0 ng/mL (control), 2 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) for 48 h. then detected the localization of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin in HaCaT cells by immunofluorescence assay, determined the mRNA levels of Snail1 and Snail2 in HaCaT cells by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, detected the proteins expression of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin, Vimentin, N-cadherin and E-cadherin in HaCaT cells by Western blot.RESULTS: The positive rates of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin, Snail1 and E-cadherin in skin lesions of SSc patients were 100%, 88.89% and 2.22% respectively, while in healthy adult skin, the corresponding positive rates were 0%, 10.00%, and 95.00%. The difference between the two groups was significant. Compared with control group, treatment with different concentrations of Wnt10b (2 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL) induced up-regulation of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin expression and promoted translocation of \\xc3\\xa2-catenin from cytoplasm to nucleus, increased the mRNA levels of Snail1 and Snail2 (P < 0.05), and up-regulated the proteins expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, down-regulated the E-cadherin protein expression in HaCaT cells (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Abnormally activated Wnt/\\xc3\\xa2-catenin signaling pathway and abnormally expressed EMT-related proteins are observed in SSc lesions. Activation of Wnt/\\xc3\\xa2-catenin signaling pathway may promote EMT in HaCaT cells. labels: #Adult#Antigens, CD#Cadherins#Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition#Humans#Keratinocytes#Scleroderma, Systemic#Skin#Snail Family Transcription Factors#Vimentin#Wnt Signaling Pathway#beta Catenin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To understand the relationship between obesity and depression in the elderly in China, and to explore whether there are differences between the genders.METHODS: The data were collected from the 2015 China Health and Retirement National Investigation (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, CHARLS). The respondents were grouped according to depressive status. The difference of depressive status between the elderly male and female groups was examined by Chi-square test. The relationship between depression, obesity and the other sociological factors was analyzed by binary logistic regression.RESULTS: There were 4 019 valid cases, including 2 109 males (52.48%) and 1 910 females (47.52%). All the respondents were aged 60 years and over. There were 474 cases of central obesity (11.79%) and 2 418 cases of abdominal obesity (60.16%). There were significant differences in central obesity and abdominal obesity between the elderly male and female groups (P < 0.001). 1 304 cases suffered from depression, accounting for 32.45%, of which 539 cases were male (41.33%) and 765 cases were female (58.67%). Different groups of gender, central obesity and abdominal obesity had significant differences in depressive status (P < 0.001). The results of univariate analysis indicated that the characteristics of female, divorced/widowed/unmarried, in rural areas, having chronic diseases and functional loss were the risk factors for depression. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that, in terms of the total sample, after adjustment for the confounding factors, both central obesity and abdominal obesity groups were less likely to suffer from depression. After stratified by gender, both central obesity and abdominal obesity were negatively correlated with depression.CONCLUSIONS: The elderly with central obesity or abdominal obesity are less likely to suffer from depression, regardless of gender. labels: #Aged#China#Depression#Female#Humans#Logistic Models#Longitudinal Studies#Male#Middle Aged#Obesity, Abdominal'
b'OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features and prognosis of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) complicated by neonatal pulmonary hemorrhage (NPH) in neonates.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 45 neonates with MAS complicated by NPH who were admitted to the hospital from December 2015 to December 2018 (observation group). Ninety neonates with MAS who were hospitalized during the same period of time and had no pulmonary hemorrhage were enrolled as the control group. The two groups were compared in terms of clinical features and prognosis.RESULTS: The observation group had a significantly lower 1-minute Apgar score after birth than the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the observation group had significantly higher incidence rates of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, air leak syndrome and shock and a higher rate of use of pulmonary surfactant (P<0.05), as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein and oxygen index (OI) (P<0.01). In the early diagnosis of NPH, OI had a sensitivity of 80.0%, a specificity of 96.7%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.959 (95% confidence interval: 0.929-0.988, P<0.001) at the cut-off value of 10.05. For the children who were cured and discharged, the observation group had significantly longer duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen inhalation and length of hospital stay than the control group (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with MAS complicated by NPH tend to have a longer duration of ventilation and higher incidence rates of air leak syndrome and shock. OI may be used as an index for the early diagnosis of MAS complicated by NPH. labels: #Hemorrhage#Humans#Infant, Newborn#Meconium Aspiration Syndrome#Prognosis#Pulmonary Surfactants#Retrospective Studies'
b'PURPOSE: To compare the 3-year outcomes of immediately loaded and one-stage conventionally loaded variable-thread tapered implants in the posterior maxilla.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a split-mouth randomised controlled trial. Twenty-six patients attending the postgraduate Periodontics Department at the Lebanese University, and missing teeth bilaterally in the posterior maxilla were randomised. All patients received three to four implants in each of the posterior sextants. The implants on one side were immediately loaded with a provisional resin fixed partial denture on definitive multi-unit abutments regardless of their primary stability. The implants in the contralateral side received definitive multi-unit abutments according to the one-stage unloaded protocol. Three to 3.5 months following implant placement, the implants were restored with metal-ceramic fixed prostheses. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis failure rates, complications, and peri-implant bone level changes up to 3 years following delivery of the definitive prosthesis. The clinical outcomes and radiographic measurements were performed by a single outcome assessor blinded to the type of interventions.RESULTS: Two patients dropped out prior to the delivery of definitive prostheses. The results were analysed using a per-protocol analysis and included 24 patients. Four implants supporting a four-unit immediately loaded prosthesis failed in one patient, 3 months following definitive prosthesis. In the same patient, the three contralateral conventionally loaded implants failed 14 months after definitive prosthesis. There were no significant differences in the proportions of implant and prosthesis failures at 3 years (difference = 0%; 95% CI 0.0% to 14.2%; P = 0.999). Peri-implantitis was diagnosed at two adjacent conventionally loaded implants in one patient at the 3-year examination. In the immediately loaded group, four early minor prosthetic complications occurred during the provisionalisation phase. Following delivery of the definitive prostheses, one minor ceramic fracture was observed in each of the implant groups. The difference in the rate of complications between the two interventions was not statistically significant at 3 years (difference = 13%; 95% CI 3.4% to 27.7%; P = 0.453). The 3-year peri-implant marginal bone level changes were evaluated in 23 patients (77 immediately loaded and 76 conventionally loaded implants). On average, patients lost 0.79 (0.62) mm at the immediately loaded and 0.91 (0.82) mm at the conventionally loaded implants, the difference being statistically not significant (difference = 0.12 mm; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.55 mm; P = 0.590). The 3-year marginal bone level changes were not significantly different between smokers (n = 12) and non-smokers (n = 11) (difference = 0.19 mm; 95% CI -0.24 to 0.62 mm; P = 0.382).CONCLUSIONS: Immediate loading of three- to four-unit fixed partial prostheses supported by variable-thread implants in the posterior maxilla can achieve similar 3-year results to one-stage conventionally loaded implants. labels: #Alveolar Bone Loss#Dental Implantation, Endosseous#Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported#Denture, Partial, Fixed#Humans#Immediate Dental Implant Loading#Maxilla'
b'Chytrids are zoosporic fungi that play an important, but yet understudied, ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Many chytrid species have been morphologically described as parasites on phytoplankton. However, the majority of them have rarely been isolated and lack DNA sequence data. In this study we isolated and cultivated three parasitic chytrids, infecting a common volvocacean host species, Yamagishiella unicocca. To identify the chytrids, we characterized morphology and life cycle, and analyzed phylogenetic relationships based on 18S and 28S rDNA genes. Host range and specificity of the chytrids was determined by cross-infection assays with host strains, characterized by rbcL and ITS markers. We were able to confirm the identity of two chytrid strains as Endocoenobium eudorinae Ingold and Dangeardia mamillata Schr?der and described the third chytrid strain as Algomyces stechlinensis gen. et sp. nov. The three chytrids were assigned to novel and phylogenetically distant clades within the phylum Chytridiomycota, each exhibiting different host specificities. By integrating morphological and molecular data of both the parasitic chytrids and their respective host species, we unveiled cryptic host-parasite associations. This study highlights that a high prevalence of (pseudo)cryptic diversity requires molecular characterization of both phytoplankton host and parasitic chytrid to accurately identify and compare host range and specificity, and to study phytoplankton-chytrid interactions in general. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Objective: To observe the clinical application effect of blood circulation enhancement technique in repairing large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities with super large free anterolateral thigh flap. Methods: From March 2014 to March 2017, 6 patients with large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities were hospitalized in our unit, including 5 males and 1 female, aged 27-65 years, 1 case of electric injury, 2 cases of coal burn, 3 cases of traffic injury, 2 cases involving upper limb, and 4 cases involving lower limb. After debridement, the wound area ranged from 26 cm?8 cm to 36 cm?15 cm, and the bone exposure area ranged from 24 cm?7 cm to 35 cm?14 cm. The blood circulation enhancement technique was used when the wound with bone exposure was repaired with super large free anterolateral thigh flap. The area of flaps ranged from 28 cm?10 cm to 38 cm?16 cm. The donor site of flap and the primary wound without bone exposure were repaired with medial thigh split-thickness skin graft of the donor leg of flap. The blood circulation enhancement technique mode during operation and the survival of flaps after operation were recorded, and the recovery of donor and recipient areas and the occurrence of complications were followed up. Results: Three patients were treated with simple vascular supercharging technique during flap transplantation, and the other 3 patients were treated with vascular supercharging and turbocharging technique during flap transplantation. All the flaps survived well in 6 patients without vascular crisis. Follow-up for 3 to 12 months after surgery showed that the blood flow of the flaps was good and the depth and superficial sensation recovered to varying degrees. Except for 1 case of upper limb flap, the other flaps had no obvious swelling and needed no second thinning. There were only depressed scars in the donor sites, and no obvious scar hyperplasia in the area without bone exposure repaired by the skin grafts. No short-term or long-term complications were found. Conclusions: The application of blood circulation enhancement technique in repairing large area of skin and soft tissue defects of extremities with super large free anterolateral thigh flaps provides reliable blood supply for the flaps and results in good effect after operation, which is worth popularizing. labels: #Adult#Aged#Female#Free Tissue Flaps#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Reconstructive Surgical Procedures#Skin Transplantation#Soft Tissue Injuries#Thigh#Treatment Outcome'

There were no significant differences among treatment groups (F\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.91; P\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.526; Wilks lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.93), raters (F\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x891.68; P\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.054; Wilks lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.83), and when testing the combined effect of treatment and rater on the results (F\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.72; P\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.866; Wilks lambda\\xe2\\x80\\x89=\\xe2\\x80\\x890.85). The raters detected slightly more positive changes in the activator and twin-block groups, compared to the control group, regarding the lower face and the lips, but these findings did not reach significance. Furthermore, their magnitude hardly exceeded 1/20th of the total VAS length.LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design.CONCLUSIONS: The perceived facial changes of convex profile patients treated with functional, followed by fixed orthodontic appliances, did not differ from those observed in normal profile patients, when full-face frontal and profile photos were simultaneously assessed. Consequently, professionals should be skeptical regarding the improvement of a patient's facial appearance when this treatment option is used. labels: #Cephalometry#Esthetics#Face#Humans#Lip#Malocclusion, Angle Class II#Orthodontic Appliances, Functional#Orthodontists#Retrospective Studies#Treatment Outcome"
b'Astaxanthin (Asta), red pigment of the carotenoid family, is known for its anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Asta on isolated human sperm in the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 capsid protein, L1. Sperm, purified by gradient separation, were treated with HPV16-L1 in both a dose and time-dependent manner in the absence or presence of 30 min-Asta pre-incubation. Effects of HPV16-L1 alone after Asta pre-incubation were evaluated by rafts (CTB) and Lyn dislocation, Tyr-phosphorylation (Tyr-P) of the head, percentages of acrosome-reacted cells (ARC) and endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Sperm membranes were also analyzed for the HPV16-L1 content. Results show that HPV16-L1 drastically reduced membrane rearrangement with percentage of sperm showing head CTB and Lyn displacement decreasing from 72% to 15.8%, and from 63.1% to 13.9%, respectively. Accordingly, both Tyr-P of the head and ARC decreased from 68.4% to 10.2%, and from 65.7% to 14.6%, respectively. Asta pre-incubation prevented this drop and restored values of the percentage of ARC up to 40.8%. No alteration was found in either the ROS generation curve or sperm motility. In conclusion, Asta is able to preserve sperm by reducing the amount of HPV16-L1 bound onto membranes. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Objective: To investigate the clinical and pathologic features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hypertrophic port-wine stain (PWS). Methods: Cases of hypertrophic PWS, collected from Henan Provincial People's Hospital between 2012 and 2018, were retrospectively analyzed for their clinical and pathologic features, immunophenotype and histochemical data, and the relevant literature was reviewed. Results: Twenty-four cases of PWS were included in this cohort, located in the head and neck region (20 cases), limbs (2 cases), and trunk (2 cases). The clinical presentations were mainly red or purple-red plaques or slow growing, painless nodules, or thickened and raised above the skin surface. Microscopically, deformed blood vessels showed honeycomb-like, plexiform or cluster-like growth pattern, and diffusely involved the dermis, skin appendages, subcutaneous fat tissue, and deep skeletal muscles; The vascular lumen of the deformed vessels was dilated (?100 \\xc3\\xacm in diameter), and in 18 cases the lumen was greater than 400 \\xc3\\xacm. The superficial dermis mainly contained few deformed capillaries. The deep wall showed thickening of blood vessel wall and fibrous tissue hyperplasia. Elastic fiber and Masson staining indicated abnormal venous vessel, which in some cases contained small amount of abnormal arterioid vessel,without vascular endothelial cell proliferation in all cases. In 24 cases, 19 cases had epidermal atrophy, 6 with vascular chronic inflammation or epidermal ulcer, 4 with capillary hemangioma, 4 with sebaceous gland hyperplasia, 2 with epidermal papillary hyperplasia and 2 with vascular keratomas. Conclusions: PWS is a common congenital capillary malformation. The number of histologically deformed capillaries is reduced and they usually locate in the superficial part. The deep vascular wall is increased with thick venous malformation, diffusely involving the dermis and deep skeletal muscle. Furthermore, PWS needs to be differentiated from infantile hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma and vascular keratomas. labels: #Humans#Port-Wine Stain#Retrospective Studies#Skin"
b'OBJECTIVE: To establish a way for screening Mycobacterium mutants through adding the screening markers into pJV53.METHODS: The sucrose counter selection gene SacB and mutant hygromycin-resistant gene hygS were inserted into pJV53; The recovery of the hygromycin-resistance indicated the successful homologous recombination in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms), which could serve as mutant screening marker; The sucrose counter selection could be used to screen the plasmid-free mutants.RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid pJV53-SacB-hygS were successfully constructed. The rifampin-resistant rpoB D516Y and rpoB H526Q mutants and MSMEG_4487 G188A mutant were efficiently screened out. All mutants had shed the plasmid successfully.CONCLUSION: pJV53-SacB-hygS can efficiently contribute to construct and screen the mutants and to get the mutants shedding the plasmid self, which has high value of extensive application; the D516Y and H526Q mutations in gene rpoB of Mycobacterium tuberculosis contribute to its rifampin-resistance. labels: #Bacterial Proteins#DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Homologous Recombination#Microbial Sensitivity Tests#Mutation#Mycobacterium smegmatis#Mycobacterium tuberculosis#Plasmids#Rifampin'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on behavioral changes, and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \\xc3\\xa1-synuclein(\\xc3\\xa1-syn), transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6) and transcription factor X box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) in the substantia nigra of Parkinson\\\'s disease (PD) rats, so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of motor function.METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into control, model and EA groups (n=12 rats in each group). The PD model was established by subcutaneous injection of rotenone (2 mg/kg) at the neck and back, once a day for 28 days. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to "Fengfu" (GV16) and bilateral "Taichong" (LR3) for 20 min, once a day for 14 successive days. The voluntary motor behavioral changes (total distance, average speed, total movement time, total rest time in 8 min) were detected by open field tests. The immuno-activity of TH and \\xc3\\xa1-syn in the substantia nigra was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA detected by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR.RESULTS: Following modeling and compared with the control group, the total distance, average speed and total movement time of voluntary movement were significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the total rest time was significantly increased (P<0.01). Moreover, the expression of TH was significantly decreased (P<0.01), and that of \\xc3\\xa1-syn protein, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA significantly increased in the model group in comparison with the control group (P<0.01). After the intervention, the total distance, average speed, and total movement time of voluntary movement in the EA group were considerably higher than those in the model group (P<0.01), and the total rest time was obviously decreased in the EA group (P<0.01). The expression level of TH was significantly increased (P<0.01), and those of \\xc3\\xa1-syn, ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA were notably decreased in the EA group compared with the model group (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: EA intervention can improve the locomotor function in PD model rats, which is associated with its functions in up-regulating the expression of TH protein and down-regulating the expression of \\xc3\\xa1-syn protein, and ATF6 mRNA and XBP-1 mRNA in the substantia nigra of mesencephalon. labels: #Activating Transcription Factor 6#Acupuncture Points#Animals#Electroacupuncture#Male#Parkinson Disease#RNA, Messenger#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley#Substantia Nigra#Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase#X-Box Binding Protein 1#alpha-Synuclein'
b'Enhanced biosynthesis and overproduction of lipid and high-value bioproducts endows microalgae as a promising feedstock for the cost-effective development of advanced bioenergy currently. In this study, multilevel heuristic LED regimes, designed with the coordination of light, nitrogen and carbons in terms of cell physiology and morphology, have been implemented to significantly induce the growth and bioproducts accumulation of Haematococcus pluvialis under mixotrophic conditions. The white-red regime with C5 organic carbon showed a good potential for enhancing microalgal biomass and lipid synthesis, especially for saturated fatty acids. The astaxanthin biosynthesis has been significantly enhanced and the highest content of 3.3% was achieved with gluconate at the white-blue regime. Additionally, white-blue regime enhanced the protein content of H. pluvialis up to 45%, increased by 40% over the white-red culture. The multilevel LED protocol can be developed synergistically with the different adaptation and tolerance of algal cell physiology and morphology for target bioproducts. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Cryopreservation is a common methodology for long-term microalgae storage. Current cryopreservation methods are based on using diverse cryoprotectants and two-step cooling protocols, followed by sample storage at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (-\\xe2\\x80\\x89196\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb0C). However, the use of this methodology requires a continuous liquid N2 supply as well as facilities with dedicated equipment, which is not affordable for every laboratory. In our work, we report on the successful development of a simple and cost-effective method for the long-term cryogenic storage of Tetradesmus obliquus at temperatures (-\\xe2\\x80\\x8980\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xb0C) used in commonly available deep freezers that are more readily accessible to laboratories. Two procedures were evaluated that were originally devised for other microalgae; this was followed by the optimization of critical parameters such as the sample's microalgal concentration and the cryoprotectant reagent's incubation time. Cell viability was monitored using the survival rates obtained by direct agar plating and the growth recovery times in liquid cultures. Viability-related variables were recorded following different storage times of up to 3\\xc2\\xa0years. The main operational factors involved in the process (cell concentration, incubation time, and storage time) were statistically analyzed with regard to their influence on the survival rate. The statistical analysis showed interdependence (a two-factor interaction) between the cellular concentration and the cryoprotectant's incubation time, on the one hand, and between the incubation time and the storage time on the other. Survival rates above 70% were obtained under optimized conditions after 3\\xc2\\xa0months of storage, along with 20-35% viabilities after 3\\xc2\\xa0years. These results open up the possibility of extending this method to other Scenedesmaceae, or even other microalgal species, and for its use in resource-limited laboratories. labels: #Chlorophyceae"
b'For the replacement of missing teeth, resin-bonded fixed partial dentures (RBFPDs) are a routine, minimally invasive option clinicians can use on patients who either cannot or will not move forward with surgical interventions.

b'Cytological study is a highly specialized type of laboratory analysis of the cellular composition of biological material and is to assess the morphological characteristics of cellular elements. The modern development of digital technologies is increasingly forming the interest of specialists to such a section as telepathology (digital pathology), which is a process of virtual microscopy with the transformation of classical cytological preparations into digital. Most morphologists currently use some forms of digital imaging, such as static images obtained by optical cameras mounted under a microscope. The development of more high quality image and resolution in the digital pathology promotes the use of telepathology, including telecitology in their daily work for training specialists, counselling of medications, monitoring the quality of diagnosis. labels: #Cytodiagnosis#Image Processing, Computer-Assisted#Microscopy#Pilot Projects#Telepathology'
b'The authors describe a case report of a 5-year-old foreign girl with a rare bilateral hip dislocation after a car accident. Young surgeons at the emergency department performed an unsuccessful closed reduction. Since the clinical and ultrasound screening of DDH of all newborns in the Slovak Republic is carried out until the age of 4-6 weeks, the treatment of dislocated hips starts early and the late diagnosed dislocations occur rarely.

b'AIMS: Correction of mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation (MR, TR) frequently leads to poor outcomes in the days following intervention. We sought to understand how abrupt correction of MR and TR affects ventricular load and to investigate if gradual correction is beneficial.METHODS AND RESULTS: MR and TR were simulated using the CircAdapt cardiovascular system model with effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) areas of 0.5 cm2 and 0.7 cm2. Ventricular and atrial contractility reductions to 40% of normal and pulmonary hypertension were simulated. Abrupt and gradual ERO closure were simulated with homeostatic regulation of blood pressure and volume. Abrupt correction of MR increased left and right ventricular fibre stress by 40% and 15%, respectively, whereas TR correction increased left and right ventricular fibre stress by 26% and 19%, respectively. This spike was followed by a rapid drop in fibre stress. Myocardial dysfunction prolonged the spike but reduced its amplitude. Right ventricular fibre stress increased more with pulmonary hypertension and TR. Gradual correction demonstrated no spike in tissue load.CONCLUSIONS: Simulations demonstrated that abrupt ERO closure creates a transient increase in ventricular load that is prolonged by worsened myocardial condition and exacerbated by pulmonary hypertension. Gradual closure of the ERO abolishes this spike and merits clinical investigation. labels: #Heart Atria#Heart Ventricles#Humans#Hypertension, Pulmonary#Mitral Valve Insufficiency#Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency'

b'In this study, two new brackish-water species of Macrostomum (M. shenda n. sp. and M. spiriger n. sp.) collected from Shenzhen, China, were described based on morphological, histological, and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Macrostomum shenda n. sp. differs from its congeners in the oblique and non-thickening distal opening of its narrow funnel-shaped stylet. In addition, its sperm have neither bristles nor brush, and are surrounded by an undulating membrane in the mid-body region. In M. spiriger n. sp., the stylet is spirally twisted. Its reproductive apparatus has a seminal bursal pore opening exteriorly. Results of the 18S and 28S rDNA phylogenetic analyses also support the establishments of these two new species. Moreover, the 18S and 28S rDNA sequences of some species within Macrostomum in previous studies have been revised to avoid ambiguity, while Macrostomum dongyuanensis Wang Sun, 2015 was re-identified as a new record of M. quiritium Kolasa, 1973 from China. labels: #Animals#China#DNA, Ribosomal#Phylogeny#Platyhelminths#Reproduction'
b"Currently, one-third of the world's chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers are in China. Therefore, it is important to develop treatment strategies that can accomplish virological suppression and improve clinical outcomes for China's huge HBV-infected population. Studies have shown that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are significantly associated with the progression of liver disease, incidence of liver complications as well as an important indicator for deciding whether to initiate anti-HBV treatment. Clinically, antiviral therapy is usually only considered when the ALT level is greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal. However, a normal or low and elevated level of ALT does not mean that there is no change in liver tissues status. Several studies have suggested that normal or low and elevated levels of ALT are significantly associated with the progression of liver disease. In this context, if the level of ALT is considered as one of the mandatory requirements for the indication of anti-HBV therapy, many patients may be neglected and delayed in treatment, suggesting that the anti-HBV treatment threshold should be considered. Now, from the above discussion, this article mainly summarizes the guiding significance of ALT level in anti-HBV treatment and the value of ALT normalization in the state of illness and clinical prognosis, and also compares the difference of ALT normalization rates among different anti-HBV drugs for chronic hepatitis B patients. Besides this, it also states the limitations of current indications for anti-HBV therapy, so as to provide reference for improving the indications. labels: #Alanine Transaminase#Antiviral Agents#Disease Progression#Hepatitis B, Chronic#Humans#Liver#Prognosis"
b'The monotypic genus Dravidogecko, represented by its type-species D. anamallensis, is singular amongst peninsular Indian gekkonid lineages in its endemism to the Western Ghats. Molecular species delimitation approaches reveal at least seven species-level lineages within the genus from its distribution range across the mid-high elevations of the southern Western Ghats of India. These lineages, albeit superficially cryptic, are patently diagnosable from each other by employing a limited but precise set of morphological characters. Six of these lineages that were obscured under the nomen D. anamallensis are herein recognized as distinct species. A reappraisal of the genus Dravidogecko is provided based on external morphology and osteological characters, along with a detailed redescription of the holotype of D. anamallensis. A key to the species based on diagnostic characters is presented. Gene-trees based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data recovered marginally disparate topologies and were consequently coalesced into a species-tree for phylogenetic inference. Timetree analysis reveals late Miocene cladogenesis in this group and establishes late Palaeocene divergence from its sister genus, Hemidactylus, making Dravidogecko one of the earliest, extant lizard lineages to have colonized peninsular India. labels: #Animals#Genetic Speciation#India#Lizards#Osteology#Phylogeny'

b'Objective To investigate the role and mechanism of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in alcohol-induced inflammation and permeability of intestinal epithelial cells. Methods To select the proper concentration of alcohol, differentiated Caco-2 cells were treated with different concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mmol/L) of alcohol, and then cell viability was assayed by MTT assay; the mRNA and protein levels of HDAC3 were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were divided into three groups: control group, alcohol group (treatment with 50 mmol/L alcohol for 60 minutes), and alcohol combined with HDAC3 inhibitor group (pretreatment with 2 \\\\xc3\\\\xacmol/L RGFP966 1 hour before alcohol). ELISA was performed to detect tumor necrosis factor \\\\xc3\\\\xa1 (TNF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa1) level in cell supernatant. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured using a resistance meter. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein levels relevant to tight junction (occludin and claudin-1) and NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB activation (I\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB and phosphorylated NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaBp65). Results Alcohol at 10, 25 and 50 mmol/L did not affect cell viability. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HDAC3 increased in a dose-dependent manner after alcohol treatment at these concentration s. Compared with the control group, TNF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa1 and phosphorylated NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaBp65 levels increased, whereas TER and protein levels of occludin, claudin-1 and I\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB decreased in the alcohol group. Compared with the alcohol group, TNF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa1 and phosphorylated NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaBp65 levels were reduced, while TER and protein levels of occludin, claudin-1 and I\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB were elevated in the alcohol combined with HDAC3 inhibitor group.

b'Verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) for over a decade. However, its extensive application has been impeded by inevitably collateral tissue damage and immediate induction of angiogenesis, in addition to the need of multiple treatments. In order to develop prospective photosensitizers for clinical use, a triphenyl phosphonium-modified cationic liposomal hypocrellin B (TPP cationic LHB) for angiogenic targeting and endothelial internalization was constructed. With optimal PDT parameters, TPP cationic LHB can lead to death of choroid-retinal vascular endothelial cells while cause negligible damage to collateral retinal pigment epithelium cells. This is likely due to the mitochondria targeting and effective intracellular singlet oxygen generation of TPP cationic LHB in vascular endothelial cells. Additionally, in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay indicated the elevated neovessel-targeting ability and photo-induced anti-angiogenic activity of TPP cationic LHB. Furthermore, TPP cationic LHB PDT is able to maintain neovessel occlusion for an extended period of time compared with verteporfin PDT, without inducing significant increased expression of some angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and integrin \\\\xc3\\\\xa1v\\\\xc3\\\\xa2\\\\xe2\\\\x82\\\\x83.

b'Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States (1). The prevalence of adult cigarette smoking has declined in recent years to 14.0% in 2017 (2). However, an array of new tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, has entered the U.S. market (3). To assess recent national estimates of tobacco product use among U.S. adults aged ?18 years, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). In 2018, an estimated 49.1 million U.S. adults (19.7%) reported currently using any tobacco product, including cigarettes (13.7%), cigars (3.9%), e-cigarettes (3.2%), smokeless tobacco (2.4%), and pipes* (1.0%). Most tobacco product users (83.8%) reported using combustible products (cigarettes, cigars, or pipes), and 18.8% reported using two or more tobacco products. The prevalence of any current tobacco product use was higher in males; adults aged ?65 years; non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives; those with a General Educational Development certificate (GED); those with an annual household income <$35,000; lesbian, gay, or bisexual adults; uninsured adults; those with a disability or limitation; and those with serious psychological distress. The prevalence of e-cigarette and smokeless tobacco use increased during 2017-2018. During 2009-2018, there were significant increases in all three cigarette cessation indicators (quit attempts, recent cessation, and quit ratio). Implementing comprehensive population-based interventions in coordination with regulation of the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of all tobacco products can reduce tobacco-related disease and death in the United States (1,4). labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Female#Health Surveys#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Smoking Cessation#Socioeconomic Factors#Tobacco Products#Tobacco Use Disorder#United States#Young Adult'

b'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis of HL60 cells induced by oncolytic virus Reovirus type 3 (Reo3).METHODS: HL60 cells were infected with Reo3 at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) with the uninfected HL60 cells as control group. After 48 h of infection, the activity of HL60 cells infected with virus at different MOI was detected by CCK8 method to investigate the influence of MOI to cell activity. Simultaneously, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells was detected by flow cytometry, and the activation level of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the expression of apoptotic-related protein in HL60 cells were detected by Western blot. Before infection with Reo3 for 48 h, HL60 cells were treated with 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a specific inhibitor of PKR, for 24 h. Afterward, the apoptotic level and expression of apoptotic related proteins were detected.RESULTS: Activity of HL60 cells was obviously inhibited after infected with Reo3 with a MOI of 1 for 48 h. The cell survival rate was (24.333\\\\xc2\\\\xb13.396)% and the apoptotic rate was (29.96\\\\xc2\\\\xb12.06)%. Both rates were all higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Western blot results showed that the expression levels of PKR, p-PKR, Bax, Caspase3 and cleaved Caspase3 in HL60 cells infected with Reo3 were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), while the expression level of Bcl-2 was lower (P < 0.05). Compared with the group without inhibitor, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells pretreated with 2-AP decreased (P < 0.05), the phosphorylation level of PKR and the expression level of apoptotic-related protein also decreased (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Oncolytic virus Reo3 could activate PKR in HL60 cells and thus induce apoptosis of HL60 cells. labels: #2-Aminopurine#Apoptosis#Caspase 3#Flow Cytometry#HL-60 Cells#Humans#Mammalian orthoreovirus 3#Oncolytic Viruses#Phosphorylation#Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2#bcl-2-Associated X Protein#eIF-2 Kinase'

b"Our laboratory previously established spinal motor neurons (MN) from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) prepared from both sporadic and familial ALS patients, and successfully recapitulated disease-specific pathophysiological processes. We next searched for effective drugs capable of slowing the progression of ALS using a drug library of 1232 existing compounds and discovered that ropinirole hydrochloride prevented MN death. In December 2018, we started an investigator-initiated clinical trial testing ropinirole hydrochloride extended-release tablets in ALS patients. This is an on-going phase I/IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, open-label continuation clinical trial (UMIN000034954). The primary aim is to assess the safety and tolerability of ropinirole hydrochloride in patients with ALS. We will also perform an efficacy evaluation using patient-derived iPSCs/MN.

b'Two new diving beetle species of the subtribe Deronectina are described from south-eastern Anatolia. Deronectes kabilcevz sp. n. belongs to the D. longipes-subgroup of the D. parvicollis-group. It is externally similar to the other members of this subgroup, but can be separated by the different shape of the median lobe of aedeagus. Deronectes propedoriae sp. n. belongs to the D. doriae-group. Analysis of molecular studies suggests that the new species and D. doriae Sharp, 1882 are closely related but undoubtedly different with an uncorrected p distance of 7% in the cytochrome oxydase gene. Also external characters allow an easy separation although only the female holotype of the new species is known-the pronotum and the last abdominal ventrite of each have very different shapes. The habitus, the genitalia and other features of the species are illustrated. The keys to species of the respective groups of genus Deronectes are updated. Including the results of this study, 61 species of Deronectes are now known. labels: #Animals#Coleoptera#Female#Turkey'
b'Background: Malaria still presents as a major health problem in Indonesia and specifically in East Kalimantan. One common finding in malaria is thrombocytopenia, the mechanism of which is still unclear. Several studies have suggested some mechanisms, one of which is splenomegaly. This study aimed to discover the association between thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly of malaria patients in East Kalimantan. Methods: This study was a descriptive retrospective study with clinical and laboratory data obtained from the medical records of malaria patients in four major public hospitals from January 2015 to July 2018. The association between thrombocytopenia with splenomegaly was analysed using Chi-Square test. Results: A total of 215 patients were included; 189 male (87.9%) and 26 female (12.1%). The most common aetiology were Plasmodium vivax (43.2%), P. falciparum (42.8%), and mixed infection ( P. falciparum and P. vivax) (4.6%). The distribution of thrombocyte count were normal in 28 patients (13%) and decreased in 187 patients (87%). Among patients with thrombocytopenia, the percentage of mild, moderate and severe thrombocytopenia was 18.2%, 43.8% and 33%, respectively. Splenomegaly was found in only 11 patients (5.1%). We found no association between thrombocytopenia with splenomegaly (p=0.61). Conclusions: We conclude that thrombocytopenia is not associated with splenomegaly in these malaria patients. labels: #Female#Humans#Indonesia#Malaria#Male#Retrospective Studies#Splenomegaly#Thrombocytopenia'
b'RATIONALE: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a slowly progressive multisystem neuromuscular disease characterized by myotonia and muscle weakness and wasting of distal and axial muscles. People with DM1, due to the disease progression, are often concerned about their ability to carry out and participate in the activities of daily living. Rehabilitation approaches in DM1, including moderate-to-intense strength training, have shown not univocal efficacy to face such difficulties. Aim of this case-study was to demonstrate the effects of a combined approach by using conventional plus robotic training in rare neuromuscular diseases, such as DM1.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 46-year-old woman came to our observation complaining of difficulty in opening fist after strong voluntary muscle contraction for about 20 years. Over the years, she referred swallowing difficulties for solid foods, balance impairment complicated by tendency to stumble and falls, fatigability, hand muscle weakness with difficulty to open bottles and lifting weights, and daytime sleepiness DIAGNOSIS:: Paraparesis in DM1.INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent 2 different trainings. The first period of treatment was carried out by using conventional physiotherapy, 6 times a week (twice a day) for 4 weeks. Then, she underwent a two-month specific task-oriented robotic rehabilitation training for the gait impairment using an overground exoskeleton, namely Ekso-GT, combined to the conventional therapy.OUTCOMES: The patient, after the EKSO training, gained a significant improvement in walking, balance and lower limbs muscle strength, as per 10-meter walking test and Left Lower Limb Motricity Index. Neurophysiological data (electroencephalography and surface electromyography) were also collected to more objectively assess the functional outcomes.LESSONS: Rehabilitation approaches in DM1, including moderate-to-intense strength training, have shown not univocal efficacy. Emerging and advancing robotic technologies can enhance clinical therapeutic outcomes by allowing therapists to activate and/or modulate neural networks to maximize motor and functional recovery. labels: #Activities of Daily Living#Combined Modality Therapy#Electromyography#Exoskeleton Device#Female#Humans#Middle Aged#Myotonic Dystrophy#Neuronal Plasticity#Physical Therapy Modalities#Resistance Training#Treatment Outcome'
b'A new species, Grapholita diehli n. sp., is described and illustrated from northern Sumatra, Indonesia. Among numerous new species of Tortricidae from Indonesia is one represented by a single specimen collected in Sumatra in 1992. Extensive sampling by many collectors over the past two centuries has resulted in no additional specimens of this unusual moth. The new species is the first described tortricid with a large light area apically in the hindwing; numerous other species have the hindwing highlighted overall, only basally, or not at all. The more typical condition is uniformly colored hindwings. labels: #Animals#Indonesia#Lepidoptera#Moths'
b"Introduction: M?ni?re's disease (MD) is a disorder that affects the inner ear, characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and vegetative symptoms. One of the main points of the management of the patients is the analysis of the vertigo diaries. Aim: To identify the typical characteristics of the symptoms and to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary approach. Material and method: 58 (12 male and 46 females, mean age 56.97 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 10.45 SD) definite MD patients were enrolled in this investigation. The vertigo diaries filled out by the patients were analysed. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS V24 software. Since the parameters did not show normal distribution, non parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test) was used. Results: Based on the diaries, the most tormenting symptom is vertigo (mean power: 5.38 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 2.06 SD), the second one is tinnitus (4.54 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 2.81 SD), and last one is headache (2.77 \\\\xc2\\\\xb1 3.1 SD). Despite the frequent prevalence of associated headache, vestibular migraine could be ruled out in all of the cases. Another important outcome was that the attacks associated with headache were significantly stronger (p = 0.001). In the case of the vegetative symptoms, the association was even much stronger (p<0.01). According to the narrative analysis, the most frequent provocation factors of the attacks were the cold front and stress. Conclusion: Along with the treatment of vertigo, the management of the associated symptoms (headache, vegetative symptoms) is also of great importance. Monitoring the quality of life and psychiatric disorders suggests the importance of multidisciplinary approach.

b'The MAP is an innovative receptive music therapy intervention derived from psychomusical relaxation methods that aims to foster the well-being and recovery of youths with mental health problems by providing them with an adaptive and effective music-assisted means to regulate their mood states. In this quasi-experimental pilot study, we assessed the mood-enhancing potential of participation in MAP sessions delivered by a music therapist in an in-patient mental health facility for children and adolescents. Using short standardized self-reported questionnaires, 20 participants aged 9-17 years old (M = 14, SD = 2.4), mainly girls (13 = 65%), rated their affective state immediately before and after two to four MAP sessions and a similar number of regular unit activity sessions used as comparison. This created a 2 ? 2 (Time ? Condition) single-group within-individual design. We analyzed pre-post session changes in affect using multilevel mixed models and found participation in MAP sessions to be associated with systematic reductions in self-reported general negative affect and state anxiety. These variations were of modest-to-large magnitude and significantly greater than those associated to participation in regular unit activities. While only a first step towards the validation of the MAP as an effective intervention to foster more adaptive and effective day-to-day mood regulation in youths with mental health problems, this study supports its specific potential to alleviate negative affects and provides a rare demonstration of the putative benefits of music therapy in a pediatric mental health inpatient context. labels: #Adolescent#Affect#Anxiety#Child#Emotions#Female#Humans#Inpatients#Male#Mental Disorders#Mental Health#Music#Music Therapy#Patient Acceptance of Health Care#Pilot Projects#Relaxation Therapy#Surveys and Questionnaires'

b'The present study describes a new species of Pyrgoma Leach, 1817, a coral associated barnacle attached to Tubastrea, from the south of New Caledonia. Pyrgoma spurtruncata sp. nov. is morphologically close to P. cancellatum Leach, 1818, P. japonica Weltner, 1897 and P. kuri Hoek, 1913 in the absence of extended tergal muscle crests. Pyrgoma cancellatum and P. kuri have a shallow, fully open, medial furrow of the tergal spur, whereas in P. spurtruncata sp. nov. the medial furrow is deeper and closed. Pyrgoma spurtruncata sp. nov. differs from P. japonica Weltner, 1897 in the width of the tergal spur and the length of the rostral tooth of the scutum.

b'In the tumor immunotherapy field, the adoptive immunotherapies, in which patient-derived T cells are strengthened ex vivo by activation or genetic modification, have been shown to be effective. However, some issues still remain to be solved. For example, it is not easy to efficiently expand tumor antigen-specific T cells, since they easily get exhausted during ex vivo culture. Moreover, these strategies are costly and time-consuming, because they are mainly conducted in autologous settings. To address these issues, we have been utilizing the induced pluripotent stem(iPS)cell technology. When iPS cells are established from tumor antigen-specific T cells, T cells regenerated from these iPS cells are expected to express the same T cell receptor(TCR)as the original T cells. In line with this concept, we succeeded in regenerating tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in 2013. We subsequently succeeded in developing a method by which very potent cytotoxic T lymphocytes are regenerated. We are now developing a strategy where non-T derived iPSCs are transduced with exogenous TCR gene efficacy and safety of which have been clinically tested. We plan to apply this approach to HLA haplotype-homozygous iPS cell stock lines, expecting that it will become possible to establish "off-the-shelf T cell" bank against various types of tumors. labels: #Antigens, Neoplasm#Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation#Humans#Immunotherapy, Adoptive#Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells#Neoplasms#T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic'
b'OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of preprocedural time-out on workflow and patient safety in computed tomography (CT)-guided procedures.METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, preprocedure time-out was assessed by an independent observer in CT-guided procedures performed from January 16, 2018, to May 15, 2018. Anonymous survey of 302 radiology team members involved in image-guided procedures about preprocedure time-out was performed using REDCap.RESULTS: Preprocedure time-out for 100 CT-guided procedures (biopsies, drainages, ablations) was observed. Procedures were recruited per observer availability and thus were nonconsecutive and nonrandom. Preprocedure time-out was performed in 100 procedures (100%). Median duration was 60 seconds (interquartile range, 60-71 seconds). Scripted checklist was followed in 52 cases (52/100, 52%). Omissions from the preprocedure time-out were identified in 40 cases (40/100, 40%) and were much more frequent when scripted checklist was not used (30/48 [63%] vs 10/52 [19%], P < 0.005). One case (1/100, 1%) was postponed due to abnormal coagulation parameters discovered during the time-out. Three cases (3/100, 3%) were delayed by 3 minutes to address other safety issues. In additional 14 cases (14/100, 14%), safety issues were raised during the time-out, which were resolved in less than 30 seconds.A total of 137 (45%) of 302 survey responses from 54 radiologists (39%), 55 technologists (40%), and 28 nurses (20%) were received. Forty-eight respondents (48/137, 35%) encountered a procedure that was cancelled or delayed as a result of information identified during time-out. Ninety-six percent (131/137) of respondents stated that time-out improves teamwork, 98% (134/137) stated that it enhances communication between the team members, and 93% (127/137) stated that it identifies and resolves problems and ambiguities.CONCLUSIONS: Scripted preprocedure time-out for CT-guided procedures takes approximately 1 minute to execute and detects safety issues in 18% of cases. labels: #Checklist#Female#Humans#Male#Patient Safety#Prospective Studies#Radiography, Interventional#Surveys and Questionnaires#Time Factors#Tomography, X-Ray Computed#Workflow'
b'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the clinical effect of modified tunnel technique (MTUN) in the treatment of gingival recession with non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL).METHODS: Forty-two teeth with Miller I degree gingival recession were divided into the NCCL group or control group depending on whether NCCL was present. Both groups were treated with MTUN plus subepithelial connective tissue. The periodontal probing depth (PD), gingival recession height (GRH), gingival recession width (GRW), attached gingival width (AGW), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were recorded before and at 3 and 6 months after operation. The mean root coverage (MRC) at 6 months after operation was calculated and analyzed. A root coverage esthetic scoring system was used to record aesthetic scores.RESULTS: GRH, GRW, and CAL of the two groups after surgery were significantly lower than those before surgery, and no significant changes in PD and AGW were observed. The MRC in the NCCL group was 63.40%\\\\xc2\\\\xb128.02%, whereas that in the control group was 67.00%\\\\xc2\\\\xb121.72%; no significant difference between the two groups was found. In terms of aesthetic outcomes, no significant difference between groups was reported.CONCLUSIONS: MTUN can effectively improve gingival recession, and the presence of shallow NCCL (?1 mm) will not affect the surgical effect of MTUN. labels: #Connective Tissue#Esthetics, Dental#Follow-Up Studies#Gingiva#Gingival Recession#Humans#Tooth Root#Treatment Outcome'
b"Chronic critical illness (CCI) refers to a group of critically ill patients who survive the acute phase of intensive care, but with persistent organ dysfunction, thus entering a chronic period of continuous dependence on life support system, and still need to stay in intensive care unit (ICU) for a long time. Persistent inflammatory response-immunosuppression-catabolic syndrome (PICS) is the main pathophysiological feature of CCI. Three factors interact to form a vicious circle, leading to poor prognosis. Nutritional support therapy is a key link in the comprehensive treatment of CCI. Enteral nutrition (EN) should be started as soon as possible if conditions permit. If EN can not be implemented, temporary or transitional parenteral nutrition (PN) should be used, and EN should be added gradually in time. At the same time, the amount of PN should be gradually reduced. When EN meets more than 60% of patients' energy and protein requirements, PN can be considered to be discontinued. The main strategies and functions of CCI nutritional support therapy are as follows: strengthening high protein supply to correct negative nitrogen balance and inhibit catabolism, selecting branched chain amino acids (BCAA) to promote anabolism, using immunomodulators (arginine, \\\\xc3\\\\xb93 polyunsaturated fatty acids) to improve immune suppression and inflammatory response, supplementing micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) to counteract the decrease in intake and the increase in consumption, and adding probiotics to maintain the intestinal microecological balance, and so on. Reasonable nutritional support therapy not only improve malnutrition of CCI patients, but also help to reduce complications, thus speeding up rehabilitation, improving prognosis, shortening ICU hospitalization time, and even reducing mortality. labels: #Chronic Disease#Critical Care#Critical Illness#Humans#Nutritional Support"
b'Aim: To describe the epidemiology of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in New South Wales (NSW) from 2006 to 2015.Methods: LGV notification data between 2006 and 2015 from New South Wales were analysed to describe time trends in counts and rates by gender, age group and area of residence, as well as anatomical sites of infection. A positivity ratio was calculated using the number of LGV notifications per 100 anorectal chlamydia notifications per year. Data linkage was used to ascertain the proportion of LGV cases that were co-infected with HIV.Results: There were 208 notifications of LGV in NSW from 2006 to 2015; all were among men, with a median age of 42 years, and half were residents of inner-city Sydney. Annual notifications peaked at 57 (1.6 per 100,000 males) in 2010, declined to 16 (0.4 per 100,000 males) in 2014, and then increased to 34 (0.9 per 100,000 males) in 2015. Just under half (47.4%) of LGV cases were determined to be co-infected with HIV.Conclusion: The number of LGV notifications each year has not returned to the low levels seen prior to the peak in 2010. Continued public health surveillance is important for the management and control of LGV. labels: #Adolescent#Adult#Aged#Chlamydia trachomatis#Disease Notification#Epidemiological Monitoring#Homosexuality, Male#Humans#Lymphogranuloma Venereum#Male#Middle Aged#New South Wales#Rectal Diseases#Sexual and Gender Minorities#Young Adult'
b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expressions of growth arrest-specific protein 7 (Gas7) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in arcuate nucleus (ARC) of rats with focal cerebral ischemia and explore the potential action mechanism of EA in treatment of focal cerebral ischemia.METHODS: A total of 50 SD rats were randomized into 4 groups, named a normal group (n =12), a sham-operation group (n =12), a model group (n =14) and an EA group (n =12). In the model group and the EA group, the thread embolization method was adopted to duplicate the model of the right middle cerebral arterial embolism. In the sham-operation group, the skin of the neck was opened and sutured without any other intervention. In the EA group, EA was applied to "Baihui" (CV 20) and "Zusanli" (ST 36) on the left side, once a day, 30 min each time, consecutively for 21 days, while there was no any intervention in the normal group, the sham-operation group and the model group. Using the immunohistochemistry (IHC) method and Western blot method, the expressions of Gas7 and NFG of ARC on the ischemic side were determined. Using Nissle staining, the morphological changes in ARC neurons were observed.RESULTS: The results of Nissle staining showed that there was no significant change in the morphology of ARC neurons in the normal group and the sham-operation group. In the model group, the volume of neuron cells was atrophied obviously and the cells were arranged irregularly. In the EA group, the morphology of ARC neuron was similar to the normal group. The results of IHC and Western blot indicated that the expressions of immunoreactive neurons and protein of Gas7 and NGF in ARC of the rats in the model group were increased obviously as compared with the normal group and the sham-operation group and the expressions in the EA group were further enhanced as compared with the model group (all P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Gas7 and NGF may be participated in the compensatory process of partial protection of the body in the patients with focal cerebral ischemia. EA up-regulates the expressions of Gas7 and NGF in ARC, which may be one of the neuroprotective mechanisms of EA in treatment of cerebral ischemia. labels: #Animals#Brain Ischemia#Cerebral Infarction#Electroacupuncture#Humans#Nerve Growth Factor#Nerve Tissue Proteins#Rats#Rats, Sprague-Dawley'

b'OBJECTIVE: To carry out the methodological quality evaluation and content analysis of the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for acupuncture-moxibustion in China, and to provide reference for the development and updating of future guidelines.METHODS: With Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation?(AGREE?), 20 evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for acupuncture and moxibustion in China were evaluated from six aspects: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability and editorial independence. In addition, the contents of 20 guidelines were systematically analyzed, and the characteristics of guidelines were summarized from the aspects of disease selection, operation technology type and safety.RESULTS: The scores of six domains were scope and purpose (91.1%), stakeholder involvement (68.5%), rigour of development (68.6%), clarity of presentation (90.3%), applicability (34.5%) and editorial independence (16.7%). The recommendations of the 20 acupuncture guidelines covered common clinical problems such as diagnosis, treatment and precautions, which were in line with the clinical characteristics of acupuncture and moxibustion in terms of content structure.CONCLUSION: The methodology of the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for acupuncture and moxibustion in China conformed to the requirements of AGREE? on the quality evaluation, and the overall quality was moderate, but the aspects of applicability and editorial independence were still needed to be improved. The contents of recommendations in 20 guidelines were specific and clear, in line with the characteristics of acupuncture and moxibustion, presenting clinical reference value. In the future, in the process of guideline development, the method of developing acupuncture and moxibustion guidelines should be constantly improved to improve the quality of the guidelines; in the meantime, more attention should be paid to the generalization and clinical applicability evaluation. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#China#Evidence-Based Medicine#Evidence-Based Practice#Humans#Moxibustion'

b'Force spectroscopy techniques are often used to learn about the free energy landscape of single biomolecules, typically by recovering free energy quantities that, extrapolated to zero force, are compared to those measured in bulk experiments. However, it is not always clear how the information obtained from a mechanically perturbed system can be related to the information obtained using other denaturants since tensioned molecules unfold and refold along a reaction coordinate imposed by the force, which is not likely to be meaningful in its absence. Here, we explore this dichotomy by investigating the unfolding landscape of a model protein, which is unfolded first mechanically through typical force spectroscopy-like protocols and next thermally. When unfolded by nonequilibrium force extension and constant force protocols, we recover a simple two-barrier landscape as the protein reaches the extended conformation through a metastable intermediate. Interestingly, folding-unfolding equilibrium simulations at low forces suggested a totally different scenario, where this metastable state plays little role in the unfolding mechanism, and the protein unfolds through two competing pathways [R. Tapia-Rojo et al., J. Chem. Phys. 141, 135102 (2014)]. Finally, we use Markov state models to describe the configurational space of the unperturbed protein close to the critical temperature. The thermal dynamics is well understood by a one-dimensional landscape along an appropriate reaction coordinate, however it is very different from the mechanical picture. In this sense, the results of our protein model for the mechanical and thermal descriptions provide incompatible views of the folding/unfolding landscape of the system, and the estimated quantities to zero force result are hard to interpret. labels: #Markov Chains#Mechanical Phenomena#Models, Molecular#Protein Conformation#Protein Unfolding#Proteins#Temperature'
b'Mesoporous TiO2 has been prepared by a brief and simple sol-gel processing and applied for the removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solution. The adsorption behavior of mesoporous TiO2 for Cu(II) was investigated using batch experiments. Results showed that the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm were more accurate to describe the kinetics process and adsorption isotherm. Mesoporous TiO2 adsorbent displayed excellent Cu(II) adsorption efficiency (195.52mg g-1). The thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic. It was also found that mesoporous TiO2 could be used at least seven times without obvious loss of its original adsorption efficiency. Therefore, the obtained mesoporous TiO2 could be employed as an effective and low-cost adsorbent for removal of Cu(II) from contaminated effluents. labels: #Adsorption#Copper#Hydrogen-Ion Concentration#Kinetics#Thermodynamics#Water'
b"Approximately 30 million persons in the United States have diabetes.* Persons with diabetes are at risk for vision loss from diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases (1). Diabetic retinopathy, the most common diabetes-related eye disease, affects 29% of U.S. adults aged ?40 years with diabetes (2) and is the leading cause of incident blindness among working-age adults (1). It is caused by chronically high blood glucose damaging blood vessels in the retina.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa0 Annual dilated eye exams are recommended for persons with diabetes because early detection and timely treatment of diabetic eye diseases can prevent irreversible vision loss\\\\xc2\\\\xa7,\\\\xc2\\\\xb6 (3,4). Studies have documented prevalence of annual eye exams among U.S. adults with diabetes (5,6); however, a lack of recent state-level data limits identification of geographic disparities in adherence to this recommendation. Medicare claims from the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) were examined to assess the prevalence of eye exams in 2017 among beneficiaries with diabetes who were continuously enrolled in Part B fee-for-service insurance, which covers annual eye exams for beneficiaries with diabetes.** This report also examines disparities, by state and race/ethnicity, in receipt of eye exams. Nationally, 54.1% of beneficiaries with diabetes had an eye exam in 2017. Prevalence ranged from 43.9% in Puerto Rico to 64.8% in Rhode Island. Fewer than 50% of beneficiaries received an eye exam in seven states (Alabama, Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, West Virginia, and Wyoming) and Puerto Rico. Non-Hispanic white (white) beneficiaries had a higher prevalence of receiving an eye exam (55.6%) than did non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) (48.9%) and Hispanics (48.2%).

b'Objective: To discuss the difference between pyrophosphoric acid method and infrared spectrophotometry for the determination of silica content in dust. Methods: The content of silica in the laboratory comparison samples organized by CDC Occupational Health Institute in China in 2018, and purchased quality control samples were determined by pyrophosphate method. Meanwhile, the samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by infrared spectrophotometry, and the results obtained by the two methods were compared. Results: Four samples (062C1?062C2?GDOHZKTG012-1?GDOHZKTG012-2) were detected by pyrophosphate method and infrared spectrophotometry. The results of pyrophosphate method were 55.49%, 5.24%, 4.90% and 54.72%, respectively. The results of infrared spectrophotometry were 0.91%, 1.87%, 1.29% and 1.16% respectively. Conclusion: The content of silica in dust determined by pyrophosphate method is higher than that by infrared spectrophotometry. labels: #Air Pollutants, Occupational#China#Diphosphates#Dust#Silicon Dioxide#Spectrophotometry, Infrared'
b'Three new Acanthodrilinae species from the states of Oaxaca, Tabasco and Chiapas in southern Mexico are described, Diplotrema oaxacana sp. nov., Diplotrema tabascensis sp. nov., and Diplotrema kaxyebensis sp. nov., respectively. D. oaxacana sp. nov. is characterized by the presence of genital setae in segments 8 and 9, a spermathecal ampulla transversally connected to the duct and paired seminal vesicles in 11 and 12. D. tabascensis sp. nov. is separated from all Diplotrema species by genital setae in segment 16. The singleton D. kaxyebensis sp. nov. is characterized by a single pair of seminal vesicles in 12, genital setae in 8 and by a particular arrangement of spermathecal duct-ampulla-diverticulum connections. It is discussed that the neotropical Diplotrema species lineage does probably not belong to the southern hemisphere Diplotrema lineage, which indeed contains the majority of species; its taxonomic separation, however, should wait until more information is obtained on the molecular relationships among neotropical Acanthodrilinae. Finally the topic of describing new earthworm species on singletons is discussed; a decision table is provided to help earthworm taxonomists to decide about this aspect.

b'BACKGROUND: There have been several case-control studies to assess the relationship between the transforming growth factor-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 (TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21) T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) gene polymorphism and lung cancer in recent years; however, the results remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the potential correlation between the TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C/C-509T polymorphism and increased risk of lung cancer through meta-analysis.METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library database, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang Data Information Service platform to identify relevant case-control studies in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to evaluate the correlation between TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 gene polymorphism and lung tumor risk. Sensitivity analysis and Egger test were used to evaluate the stability of the results and possible publication bias.RESULTS: A total of 8 studies, with 3680 patients and 4018 controls, were included. The meta-analysis revealed that there was no conspicuous correlation between the TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) variant and lung cancer in the overall population. For TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 C-509T, a significant decreased risk was identified in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the analysis stratified by disease (TT vs CT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8aCC: P\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a.02, OR\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a=\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.90). However, for TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C, subgroup analysis showed no correlation between the T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in patients with NSCLC. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no distinct association was observed between T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in the Asian and Caucasian groups. Moreover, no significant association was found in the analysis of groups stratified by age, sex, and smoking history.CONCLUSION: The TGF-\\\\xc3\\\\xa21 T\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a+\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x8a869C (rs1982073) and C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphisms are not implicated in lung cancer susceptibility in the overall population. However, our analysis indicated that the C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism decreases the risk of lung cancer in patients with NSCLC. labels: #Case-Control Studies#Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Humans#Lung Neoplasms#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Transforming Growth Factor beta1'
b"Background and Objective: Various types of osteoconductive graft materials are used for the management of alveolar bone defects arising out of periodontal disease. Inorganic, self-setting, bioactive bone cements are suggested to be most appropriate because they can conformally fill the bone defect and resorb progressively along with the regeneration of the host site. A new calcium sulfate-based bioactive bone cement (BioCaS) is developed, having simplicity and effectiveness for bone grafting applications. The response of primary human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells to this material is investigated through in vitro cell culture model so as to qualify it for the repair of periodontal infrabony defects.Method: The BioCaS was designed as powder-liquid combination with in-house synthesized high purity calcium sulfate hemihydrate incorporating hydrogen orthophosphate ions. hPDL cells were isolated, cultured and characterized using optimized primary cell culture techniques. The cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility of the BioCaS samples were evaluated using the hPDL cells, with hydroxyapatite ceramic material as control. Osteogenic differentiation of the hPDL cells in presence of BioCaS was also evaluated using Alizarin red staining, Alizarin red assay, Von Kossa staining and Masson's trichrome staining.Results: The primary cell culture techniques yielded a healthy population of periodontal ligament cells, with fibroblast morphology and characteristic marker expressions. The hPDL cells exhibited good viability, adhesion and spreading to the BioCaS cement in comparison to sintered hydroxyapatite. In addition, the cells differentiated to osteogenic lineage in the presence of the BioCaS cement, without extraneous osteogenic supplements, confirming the inherent bioactivity of the cement.Conclusion: The new BioCaS cement is a potential candidate for the repair of periodontal defects. labels: #Bone Cements#Calcium Sulfate#Dental Cementum#Humans#Osteogenesis#Periodontal Ligament"
b'Objective: To explore the prevalence of occupational musculoskeletal disorders (OMD) and its influencing factors among rural migrant workers in Tianjin, with the aim of developing strategies to improve the health condition of this specific population. Methods: Questionnaire survey was conducted among 415 rural migrant workers working in Tianjin about their fundamental state and occupational musculoskeletal disorders (OMD) during January 2015 to January 2016. Statistical methods were utilized to analyze the influencing factor. Results: A total of 415 rural migrant workers were investigated, in which young Young adults and low education level were in the majority of rural migrant workers. The prevalence of OMD for whole population, male and female were 28.92% (120/415), 33.06% (81/245) and 22.94% (39/170), respectively. Prevalence showed significant differences njin and workplace hygiene. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risks of OMD increased with age group, and decreased with higher education level. The risk of OMD among rural migrant workers with monthly income between 3000 to 5000 yuan was 2.26 times (95%CI: 1.37-3.75) higher than that of low-income workers (<3000 yuan per month). Workers engaged in housekeeping service had 2.28 times higher risk of OMD than those in manufacturing industry (95%CI: 1.06-4.89) . Conclusion: Prevalence of OMD among rural migrant workers is higher than that of general people. Age, education, monthly income, occupation are the independent influencing factors for OMD among rural migrant workers. labels: #China#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Male#Musculoskeletal Diseases#Occupational Diseases#Prevalence#Risk Factors#Surveys and Questionnaires#Transients and Migrants#Young Adult'
b'The demosponge genus Endectyon is characterized by the presence of acanthostyles with recurved or clavulate spines. Two subgenera are recognized, Endectyon and Hemectyon, distinguished mainly by the acanthostyles being located only in the periphery of the axial skeleton in Endectyon, or forming the ectosomal brushes in Hemectyon. Sixteen species are known worldwide, of which only two were reported from the Western Atlantic Ocean. However, the type locality of Endectyon xerampelina is uncertain, and it could be located either in the Western Atlantic or in Australia. In the present study, we describe new records of E. xerampelina from the Brazilian coast and propose that Raspailia (R.) johnhooperi from the Guyana shelf is a junior synonym of E. xerampelina. Our results support the hypothesis that the type locality of E. xerampelina is located somewhere in the Tropical Western Atlantic Ocean and also that the species belongs to the subgenus Endectyon (Endectyon). We amended the diagnosis of the subgenus Endectyon (Endectyon) to account for the variability of acanthostyle shape in E. (E.) xerampelina, assigning greater taxonomic value to the position of the echinating megascleres than to their shape and pattern of spination. labels: #Animal Distribution#Animals#Atlantic Ocean#Australia#Brazil#Guyana#Porifera'
b'The underlying mechanism of the development of cups and grooves on occlusal tooth surfaces is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors contributing to in-vitro cup formation, and to elucidate the clinical process. Extracted human molar teeth were exposed to acidic aqueous solutions at pH of 4.8 and 5.5 in combination with different loading conditions: no load (0N, control), 30N or 50N. Before and after 3 months exposure, the samples were scanned using a non-contact profilometer. A statistically significant difference between a loading of 0N and 50N was found at pH 4.8 (p < 0.002). Cup shaped lesions had formed only at pH of 4.8, in the 30N and 50N groups. The study showed that a cup can arise fully in enamel and that this requires simultaneous acidic and mechanical loading. labels: #Dental Enamel#Humans#Hydrogen-Ion Concentration#Molar#Tooth Attrition#Tooth Erosion#Tooth Wear'

b'Genetic analysis is an important part of undergraduate genetics teaching and tetrad analysis is unique and integral for genetic analysis of fungi. The ordered tetrad in Neurospora is an important material for genetic analysis, which can not only be used to study recombination between genes and centromeres, but also between genes themselves, as well as study the fine cross patterns between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. However, in textbooks and related professional journals, there is a lack of specific introduction to the induction methods of the seven basic class asci used in two genes analysis. In the present paper, we designed a table presenting the correlation between the three tetrad types (PD, NPD, T) and the four segregation pattern groups (? ?, ? ?, ? ?, ? ?) to visually show the 12 possible combinations (3?4=12). Then five of them were excluded through the "?" symbol and in addition with three comments attached with the table, thus finally we obtained seven basic ascus types. We hope that this analytical method can assist the teaching of ordered tetrad analysis in Neurospora. labels: #Centromere#Chromosome Segregation#Meiosis#Neurospora'
b'Sometimes it is difficult to diagnose temporal arteritis because the complaints may vary, change in intensity and are not always characteristic. The condition is a cranial form of giant-cell arteritis affecting large and medium-sized arteries. The first manifestation of temporal arteritis can be a sore tongue that does not manifest any abnormalities during a clinical investigation. In a later stage patients sometimes develop ulceration or necrosis of a part of one side of the tongue. Other symptoms can be a recently developed headache, jaw claudication and acute loss of vision. To diagnose temporal arteritis, histological investigation of a biopsy of the temporal artery is carried out. The treatment consists of long-term use of corticosteroids. A patient in your practice with inexplicable pain on one side of the tongue, without clinical abnormalities, or an ulceration of the tongue without an immediately apparent cause may have temporal arteritis. labels: #Biopsy#Diagnosis, Differential#Giant Cell Arteritis#Humans#Temporal Arteries#Tongue#Tongue Diseases'

b'A woman in her early 60s noticed bilateral breast masses and visited a different hospital. Core needle biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the right breast and invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. After referral to our department, PET-CT was performed. Compared with mild fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in left breast cancer(BC), highly accumulated lesions were found on the right breast, left anterior chest wall, nasopharynx, and tonsil. The right breast lesion was the largest with a diameter of 30mm and was considered the primary lesion of malignant lymphoma(ML). The ML was classified as stage ?, pathologically proven with erythema of the left breast and nasopharynx. Three courses of R-CHOP were performed. However, due to suspicion of heart failure, chemotherapy was changed to R-CEOP(non-anthracycline-containing regimen)and 3 courses were additionally performed. The therapeutic effect of R-Chemo for ML was CR. Left BC showed a tendency of shrinkage. After intrathecal administration of anticancer drugs to prevent infiltration of ML into the central nervous system and preoperative endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitor, left lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. BC was classified as clinical stage ?A and had an estrogen receptor score of 3b.

b'Objective: To assess the technical success rate, stent patency, clinical efficacy and complications of stent placement for filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out for 12 patients with filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava associated with severe post-thrombotic syndrome, who underwent stent placement after ineffective conservative therapy at Nanjing First Hospital from March 2016 to December 2018,9 males and 3 females, aged from 48 to 77 years, mean age 60 years, six had bilateral lower extremity symptoms and six had unilateral lower extremity symptoms.Technical success rate, stent patency, clinical efficacy and complications of stent placement were recorded. Clinical success was defined as relief of symptoms and a decrease in clinical, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology (CEAP) score for at least grade 1. Results: Stent placement in the unilateral or bilateral iliocaval occlusion was successful in 11 patients. The cause of technical failure in the single patient with failed stent placement was an inability to cross the occluded left iliacvein and the patient was treated with stent placement in the right iliocaval vein.There were 7 patients with inferior vena cava and unilateral iliocaval stent placement; 5 patients with inferior vena cava and bilateral iliocaval stent placement. Acute stent thrombosis occlusion occurred in 1 case after the operation, the blood flow recanalized after catheter-directed thrombolysis and re-stenting. All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months, with an average of (13\\\\xc2\\\\xb16) months. During the follow-up period, CTV or venography of lower limbs showed that the blood flow in the stent was unobstructed. At the last follow-up, 12 patients were evaluated as clinically effective. Three patients had transient treatment of lateral lumbar pain during operation, which alleviated by themselves.No significant abdominal pain, severe hemorrhage, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and other complications related to treatment occurred in all patients during perioperative period and follow-up. Conclusion: Stent placement is safe and feasible in the treatment of filter-related chronic occlusion of the inferior vena cava, which can alleviate the clinical symptoms of severe post-thrombotic syndrome. labels: #Aged#Female#Humans#Male#Middle Aged#Retrospective Studies#Stents#Treatment Outcome#Vascular Patency#Vena Cava Filters#Vena Cava, Inferior#Venous Thrombosis'

b'OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and related proteins of inflammation and anti-oxidative stress in spinal cord in mice with spinal cord injury (SCI), so as to explore its mechanisms underlying function repair.METHODS: Thirty-six female C57BL/6 mice were equally randomized into 3 groups: sham operation, model and EA. The SCI model was established by clamping the spinal cord for 25 s with a serrefine after laminectomy of the 1st lumbar vertebra (L1). EA (1.5 Hz/7.5 Hz, 1.0 mA) was applied to bila-teral "Zusanli" (ST36) and "Sanyinjiao" (SP6) for 10 min, once a day for 7 days. The hindlimb locomotor function was assessed according to the state of the range of motion, coordination, claw gesture of the hind leg ankle-joint, trunk stabi-lity and the tail posture by using Basso Mouse Scale(BMS). The histopathological changes of the injured area of the spinal cord were determined by H.E. staining. The expression levels of ApoE, phosphorylated nuclear transcription factor-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB(p-NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB), interleukin 1 beta(IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2), phosphorylated extracellular regulatory protein kinase(p-ERK1/2), extracellular regulatory protein kinase(ERK1/2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) and heme oxidase-1(HO-1) in the spinal cord were detected by Western blot, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes were displayed by immunofluorescence staining.RESULTS: After modeling, the BMS scores were significantly decreased in the model group compared with the sham operation group (P<0.05). Following EA, the BMS scores were markedly increased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05), suggesting an improvement of the hindlimb locomotor function. H.E. stain showed structural disorder with lots of cavities, severe inflammatory infiltration with large quantity of inflammatory cells, and apparent reduction of normal neurons in the injured spinal cord tissue of model group, which was milder in the EA group. The expression levels of ApoE, p-NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB, IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2, p-ERK1/2 (not ERK1/2), Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly increased in the model group than those in the sham operation group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression levels of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, Nrf2 and HO-1 were further notably up-regulated (P<0.05), and those of p-NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB and IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2 proteins obviously down-regulated in the EA group (P<0.05). Immunoflorescence staining showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells was apparently increased in the model group compared with the sham operation group and observably decreased in the EA group relevant to the model group (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: EA can significantly improve locomotor function in SCI mice, which is associated with its effects in reducing inflammation, oxi-dative stress reactions and reactive astrocyte proliferation via up-regulating expression of ApoE, p-ERK1/2, and Nrf2/HO-1 (antioxidant pathway) and inhibiting IL-1\\\\xc3\\\\xa2 and NF-\\\\xc3\\\\xaaB expression. labels: #Animals#Electroacupuncture#Female#Heat-Shock Proteins#Inflammation#Locomotion#Mice#Mice, Inbred C57BL#Oxidative Stress#Spinal Cord#Spinal Cord Injuries'
b'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. About 10% of all ALS cases are familial, and we have identified SOD1 and FUS mutations as the most common causes in a consecutive series of 111 familial ALS pedigrees in Japan (Nishiyama A, 2017). From studies of the TDP43, FUS, and C9orf72 genes, perturbations of RNA processing can be highly adverse in motor neurons. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting factors for motor neurons. We administered human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) by continuous intrathecal delivery to transgenic rats at onset of paralysis for 4 weeks. Intrathecal administration of hrHGF attenuated motor neuron degeneration and prolonged the duration of the disease by 63% (Ishigaki A, 2007). To translate this strategy to human treatment, we induced a contusive cervical spinal cord injury in the common marmoset, a primate, and then administered hrHGF intrathecally. We conducted a first-in-human phase I trial of intrathecal hrHGF in 15 Japanese patients with ALS (Warita H, 2019). Based on the results, we are conducting a phase II trial of intrathecal hrHGF for patients with ALS. labels: #Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis#Animals#Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic#Disease Models, Animal#Hepatocyte Growth Factor#Humans#Injections, Spinal#Japan#Motor Neurons#Rats#Rats, Transgenic#Recombinant Proteins'
b"BACKGROUND: De Quervain disease (dQD) is a painful condition of the wrist that affects patients' quality of life and work ability. Acupotomy has been widely used in the treatment of dQD. It has been reported in many articles that acupotomy can improve the clinical symptoms of dQD. However, the efficacy has not been evaluated scientifically and systematically. The aim of this systematic review protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupotomy treatment compared with local steroid injection in patients with de Quervain disease.METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled trials will be identified by searching 9 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Chinese literature databases, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database [CBM], China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], SinoMed, Technology Journal [VIP], and the Wanfang Database). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Acupotomy for dQD patients will be identified independently by 2 reviewers by searching the databases from inception to October 2018. Clinical effects will be evaluated as the primary outcome. The VAS (visual analog scale) score will be assessed as a secondary outcome. RevMan V.5.3 will be used to perform a fixed effect meta-analysis, and the evidence level will be evaluated by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. Continuous outcomes will be presented as the mean differences or standard mean differences, while dichotomous data will be expressed as relative risks.RESULTS: This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupotomy in the treatment of de Quervain disease in RCTs with high-quality VAS and RM.CONCLUSION: This systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether acupotomy is an effective intervention for patients with de Quervain disease.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018108786. labels: #Acupuncture Therapy#De Quervain Disease#Humans#Injections, Intra-Articular#Pain Measurement#Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic#Recurrence#Research Design#Steroids#Systematic Reviews as Topic#Treatment Outcome#Wrist Joint"
b'Objective: To explore the resistance mechanism and gene type of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in burn care unit. Methods: A total of 27 CRKP strains were primarily isolated from 22 patients [20 males, 2 females, aged (42\\\\xc2\\\\xb116) years] admitted to burn care unit of Institute of Burn Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University, hereinafter referred to as our department) from January to December 2017. After identification of bacteria, the months of detection and distribution of sample source were analyzed. Drug resistance tests of 15 antibiotics were conducted. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the drug resistant genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used to analyze the gene type of strains. Results: (1) During the whole year of 2017, CRKP strains were mostly detected in August (8 strains), September (6 strains), and October (5 strains), with no CRKP in January, March, June, November, and December. Five strains from bed units were detected in August (2 strains), September (1 strain), and October (2 strains). (2) Twenty-seven CRKP strains were derived from blood samples (40.7%, 11/27), wound exudate samples (18.5%, 5/27), deep vein catheter samples (11.1%, 3/27), sputum samples (7.4%, 2/27), urine samples (3.7%, 1/27), and bed unit samples (18.5%, 5/27). (3) The 27 CRKP strains were detected with drug-resistance rates of 100.0% to 7 antibiotics including cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ertapenem, and compound sulfamethoxazole, no drug-resistance to tigecycline, with drug-resistance rates higher than 81.0% to the rest 7 antibiotics. (4) Detection rates for resistance gene bla(CTX-M-10), bla(SHV), bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(ACT), and bla(KPC) were all above 92.5%. (5) According to PFGE, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 types (A, A(1), A(2), B, C, and D). Strains of type A were mainly detected in February, May, and September, with detection rate of 37.0% (10/27). Strains of type C were mainly detected in July, August, and October, with detection rate of 48.1% (13/27). Strains of types A(1), A(2), B, and D were scatteredly detected, with detection rate of 3.7% (1/27) respectively. According to MLST, the 27 CRKP strains had 6 STs. ST11 was the most frequent type, accounting for 74.1% (20/27), which was detected in August to October. The detection rate of ST395, ST2230, ST215, ST260, and STnew ranged from 3.7%(1/27) to 7.4%(2/27), and the strains were scatteredly detected. Conclusions: The main source of CRKP from burn care unit of our department was bloodstream. All the CRKP strains showed high drug-resistance rate and complicated resistance mechanism. There were small scale outbreaks caused by CRKP of type A, type C, and ST11, which should be paid more attention to in clinical treatment and infection control. labels: #Adult#Anti-Bacterial Agents#Burn Units#Burns#Carbapenems#Drug Resistance, Bacterial#Female#Humans#Klebsiella Infections#Klebsiella pneumoniae#Male#Microbial Sensitivity Tests#Middle Aged#Multilocus Sequence Typing#beta-Lactamases'
b'The original English version of the palliative performance scale (PPS) has been used for two decades to describe the functional status of palliative patients. Based on clinical parameters PPS helps to estimate the survival time of palliative patients: the higher the functional status the longer the survival. This is interesting for patients, their family caregivers and health care professionals in order to plan for care. Until now there has not been published an official German version of the PPS.The functional status via a\\\\xc2\\\\xa0German version of the PPS of 394 patients of a\\\\xc2\\\\xa0palliative consulting team and their survival times were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier-curves were drawn and tested for differences. The hypothesis was tested if functional status using the German version of the PPS and survival are correlated. In this population differences in survival could clearly be shown for any category of PPS.This German version of the PPS is a\\\\xc2\\\\xa0useful and possible tool to estimate survival time of palliative patients using just clinical information. labels: #Cancer Survivors#Caregivers#Humans#Neoplasms#Palliative Care#Prognosis#Survival Analysis'
b'After examining the tardigrade specimens collected in New Zealand and attributed by Tumanov (2004) to Macrobiotus cf. coronatus, the authors considered it justifiable to describe for them a new species named Mesobiotus helenae. It is very similar to Mesobiotus pseudoblocki Roszkowska, Stec, Ciobanu Kaczmarek, 2016 but differs in lacking eyes, having differently shaped claws (the terminal portion of both claw branches are longer and more slender), and similar egg processes but not identically shaped, with almost invisible ornamentation on the basal portion. labels: #Animals#New Zealand#Tardigrada'
b'Okubasca Dworakowska, 1982, formerly treated as a subgenus of Empoasca Walsh, 1862, is elevated to status as a separate genus. Two new species of Okubasca from China are described and illustrated: Okubasca convoluta Yu Yang sp. nov.; Okubasca paracalvata Yu Yang sp. nov. Okubasca convoluta is similar to O. okubella in having the aedeagal shaft about as long as the preatrium but differs in having the aedeagus of uniform thickness in lateral view, the anal tube process straight and the face mostly black. Okubasca paracalvata resembles Okubasca calvata in aedeagal shape, but differs in having a lamellar swelling and a small tooth on the dorsal side of the aedeagus, and the vertex anterior margin rounded. labels: #Animals#China#Hemiptera'
b'Renal cell carcinoma is the seventh most common cancer in the United States, and its metastatic form has a very poor prognosis due to a lack of effective treatment and thorough understanding on metastatic mechanism. This chapter will demonstrate a novel concept that intratumoral heterogeneity is essential for metastasis in renal cell carcinoma. We will first introduce the in vitro system and the mouse model that led to the finding of the cooperative mechanism for metastasis. Then, the results from the CAM model illustrate the cooperative interactions that lead to metastasis also occur in this model. We believe that the CAM model, as a unique and sustainable system, can open up new opportunities to study the metastatic disease. labels: #Animals#Carcinoma, Renal Cell#Chick Embryo#Chorioallantoic Membrane#Disease Models, Animal#Humans#Kidney Neoplasms#Mice#Neoplasm Metastasis#Neoplasm Transplantation#Prognosis'
b'A new species of Stethelmis, S. shepardi sp. nov., is described for Patagonia, Argentina from adults of both sexes. A full description and illustrations of both the adult and the larva of the new species are provided with comments on its habitat and distribution. Adults of the new species are compared with those of S. kaszabi (Hinton 1970) and S. chilensis (Hinton 1945). The larva of S. shepardi is compared with that of S. kaszabi, the other Stethelmis larva described. We also describe and illustrate for the first time the male genitalia of S. kaszabi. A key to the known species of Stethelmis is also included. labels: #Animal Distribution#Animals#Argentina#Coleoptera#Ecosystem#Female#Male'
b'In aortic valve disease cases, prosthetic valves have been used for valve replacement, however, these prostheses have inherent problems, and their quality in some countries is lower comparing to new-generation models, causing shorter durability. Aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) has emerged as an option, which can be applied to a wide spectrum of these diseases. Despite the promising results, this procedure is not widely spread among cardiac surgeons yet. We developed a surgical technique combining Bentall and Ozaki procedures to treat patients with concomitant ascending aorta replacement and AVNeo and we describe it in this paper. labels: #Aorta#Aortic Valve#Heart Valve Diseases#Heart Valve Prosthesis#Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation#Humans#Medical Illustration#Prosthesis Design#Reproducibility of Results'
b'A new species Ypsolopha rhinolophi Corley is described from northern Portugal and south-east France. It resembles Y. alpella (Denis Schifferm?ller, 1775) and Y. lucella (Fabricius, 1775) but shows clear differences from both species in DNA barcode and in male and female genitalia. Male genitalia of Y. lucella are illustrated for the first time. The new species has been collected at light, reared from larvae on Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and recognised from DNA barcode fragments obtained from droppings of horseshoe bats. labels: #Animals#Chiroptera#Female#France#Genitalia, Male#Lepidoptera#Male#Moths#Portugal'
b'Background Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from the loss of ovarian follicular activity. This is established fact that the quality of life of menopausal women deteriorates as the effect of menopausal symptoms. Objective To assess the physical domain, psychological domain, vasomotor domain for quality of life and its association with selected socio-demographic variables of menopausal women. Method Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the menopausal women aged 45-60 years whose menstruation has ceased for a complete one year naturally excluding those having thyroid disorders and mentally disable. Structured questionnaire was used adopting Nepali version of Modified Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire. Data collection was accomplished during August - September 2016. Data entered in MS excel were analysis using SPSS version 21. Descriptive as well as inferential statistics were applied for the data analysis. Result Among vasomotor domain hot flushes or flashes (81.9%), sweating (76.7%) and night sweats (73.3%); among psychosocial domain accomplishing less than I used to (94.8%), experiencing poor memory (80.2%), being impatient with other people (76.7%), feeling depressed down or blue (71.6%), feeling anxious or nervous (55.2%), feeling of wanting to be alone (55.2%) and being dissatisfied with my personal life (37.1%). Among physical domain aching in muscles and joints (94.8%), decrease in physical strength (94.8%), low backache (88.8%), feeling tired or worn out (84.0%), difficulty sleeping (81.0%), aches in back of neck or head (76.7%) were the major symptoms. Among sexual domain vaginal dryness during sexual intercourse (60.3%), avoiding intimacy (52.6%) and change in sexual desire (55.2%) were the major symptoms. Overall observation is that vasomotor symptoms were highest followed by sexual, psychosocial and physical symptoms having statistically significant association between vasomotor symptoms and ethnicity (p=0.019) and sexual symptoms and marital status (p=0.010). Conclusion Majority of the study subjects were from the marginalized groups of people. Vasomotor symptoms had highest prevalence followed by sexual, psychological and physical symptoms. As significant associations were observed between vasomotor symptoms and ethnicity and sexual symptoms and marital status, awareness and periodical checkups were recommended. labels: #Adult#Cross-Sectional Studies#Female#Humans#Menopause#Middle Aged#Nepal#Prevalence#Quality of Life#Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological#Surveys and Questionnaires'
b'The Xiphydria palaeanarctica group is defined to include the following three black northeast Asian Xiphydria woodwasp species with white-marked abdomen, and the females with white-marked antennae: X. ogasawarai Matsumura, 1927, X. palaeanarctica Semenov-Tian-Shanskij, 1921, and X. nagasei Shinohara, sp. nov. Based on the examination of the type material, the synonymy of X. jezoensis Matsumura, 1927, with X. palaeanarctica is confirmed and X. alnivora Matsumura, 1927, is synonymized with X. ogasawarai. Xiphydria nagasei is described from Japan (Honshu). Collection records are given for all 203 specimens examined. labels: #Animals#Color#Female#Hymenoptera#Japan'
b'A taxonomic review of the genus Vespula Thomson in Vietnam is reported. Three species are recorded: V. flaviceps (Smith, 1870), V. koreensis (Radoszkowski, 1887), and V. orbata (Buysson, 1902). Of these, V. flaviceps is newly recorded from Vietnam. Distribution records of all three species and an identification key to species based on morphological characters are presented. Vespula koreensis is distributed from high (Cao Bang, Vinh Phuc, Quang Tri) to lower areas (Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, Lang Son, Bac Giang), while the other two species are distributed in high mountainous areas of the northern and central regions of Vietnam such as in Cao Bang, Lao Cai, Son La, Phu Tho, Vinh Phuc, Quang Tri and Quang Nam provinces. labels: #Animals#Hymenoptera#Vietnam#Wasps'
b'To improve oral health for frail and care-dependent older people, both intra- and extramurally, in the Euregio Rhine-Waal area in the Netherlands and Germany, we inventoried barriers to oral care for the target group according to the literature, the organisation of oral care in both countries and the implications of this organisation for daily and professional (oral) healthcare and oral care. Results show most identified barriers are common to both countries, but the organisation of oral healthcare differs in both countries. The main differences lie in the financing and organisation of oral care in the intramural situation. In the Netherlands, this is to a large degree regulated and organised on the basis of the Chronic Care Act (Wlz), using the Verenso Oral Care Directive for care-dependent clients as a base for enforcement. In Germany, on the other hand, the provision of oral care in the home situation is more effectively facilitated. In both countries, various initiatives have recently been employed to improve, among other things, information supply, education and financing of oral healthcare. labels: #Aged#Aged, 80 and over#Delivery of Health Care#Dental Care for Aged#Frail Elderly#Germany#Humans#Netherlands#Oral Health'
b'Corallimorpharians are a relative small group of anthozoan cnidarians, also known as jewel sea anemones. They resemble actiniarian sea anemones in lacking a skeleton and being solitary, but resemble scleractinian corals in external and internal morphology, and they are considered to be the sister group of the stony corals. Corynactis carnea (=Sphincteractis sanmatiensis) is a small, common and eye catching species that inhabits the shallow water of northern Patagonia and the Argentinean shelf up to 200 m depth. Corallimorphus rigidus is registered for the first time from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It is a rather big and rare species that inhabits only the deep sea. Only two specimens were found at 2934 m depth in Mar del Plata submarine canyon, in an area under the influence of the Malvinas current, which may explain its occurrence. These two species are the only two known jewel sea anemones in the Argentinean sea and are reported and described herein. labels: #Animals#Anthozoa#Atlantic Ocean#Falkland Islands#Sea Anemones'
b"Riethia Kieffer, known previously from New Zealand for a species stated to be also in Australia plus several Australian and South American species, is revised for the Austro-Pacific region. The three previously-described Australian species Riethia stictoptera Kieffer (the genotype), Riethia cinctipes Freeman and Riethia plumosa Freeman are distinct and valid, and are redescribed in all stages. In contrast, Riethia zeylandica Freeman now is restricted to New Zealand: Australian specimens previously allocated to R. zeylandica belong to several new species recognised on morphology of adult male, pupa and larva, with guidance from molecular data. Most belong to a widespread eastern Australian Riethia azeylandica sp. n.: others are allocated to Riethia hamodivisa sp. n., Riethia paluma sp. n., Riethia phengari sp. n. and Riethia queenslandensis sp. n., each with a more restricted range. From Western Australia three species, Riethia donedwardi sp. n., Riethia noongar sp. n. and Riethia wazeylandica sp. n., are described as new from adult male, pupa and larva. Riethia kakadu sp. n. is described from the monsoonal tropics of Northern Territory from the adult male and tentatively associated pupa. From New Caledonia a reared species is described as Riethia neocaledonica sp. n.. Illustrated identification keys are provided for the males, pupae and larvae. Unassociated larvae that key to reared described species are excluded from type status, and based on morphology and molecular evidence three unreared larval types, 'A', 'B' and 'C', are also described and keyed. Previously reported molecular vouchers are reviewed, and certain Genbank accessions re-identified. Extensive data shows Riethia are distributed almost throughout Australia from standing and flowing waters, from tropics and subtropics to cool temperate Tasmania, but probably only in permanent and standing waters. The immature stages of several taxa can co-occur: as many as four can be found simultaneously in one site. Terminology of the volsellae of the male genitalia and the dorsal head and maxilla of the larva is reviewed. labels: #Animals#Chironomidae#Larva#Male#New Caledonia#New Zealand#Northern Territory#Pupa#Tasmania#Western Australia"
b'Amolops shuichengicus sp. nov., a new species of the A. mantzorum group is described from Guizhou, southwest China, on the basis of significant molecular divergences in 16S + CO1 genes and the combination of morphological characteristics: small body size, SVL 34.6-39.6 mm in adult males and 48.5-55.5 mm in adult females; dorsal skin relatively smooth; presence of vomerine teeth; presence of cream maxillary gland from lower edge of eye to the anterior of supratympanic fold; presence of supratympanic folds and glandular dorsolateral folds; tympanum indistinct; absence of a circummarginal groove on the disk of the first finger; presence of supernumerary tubercles below the base of fingers III and IV; absence of outer metatarsal tubercle and tarsal glands; males without vocal sacs. In addition, evidenced by the phylogenetic analyses in this study and literature data, we suggest that A. liangshanensis should be synonymized with A. loloensis and the records of A. marmoratus in Yunnan, China should be referred to A. afghanus. Following our proposal, the genus Amolops contains 57 species, with 32 recorded from China. labels: #Animals#Anura#Body Size#China#Female#Male#Phylogeny#Ranidae'

b"Creating and maintaining a functional vascular access (VA) is a critical factor in the survival of a dialysis patient. It implies a creative attitude either to maintain its functionality or to build a new one wherever possible, being it autologous or synthetic. We describe the VA history of a 59 years-old male patient, with extreme obesity, which started in 2012 with failed attempts of VA construction in both forearms until a functional brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the right upper limb was achieved. However, it required ligation due to severe venous hypertension secondary to central venous disease related to previous CVC use. As he had no good superficial conduit in the left arm we decided to harvest the arterialized right cephalic vein and implant it in the left arm, creating an autologous arteriovenous shunt between the brachial artery and axillary vein (AV). Despite initial patency, it failed irreversibly approximately one year after creation. As no more superficial veins were available in the upper limbs, a prosthetic access was the next step. We decided for a hybrid graft (HG) between the left brachial artery and the AV because of the patient's biotype and scarred axilla that impeded a safe re-intervention on the AV. This graft was used between 2015 and 2017 with multiple interventions to maintain patency. In 2017 a significant diffuse prosthesis deterioration and reduced AVF flow were noticed with no possible segmental reconstruction. We were then forced to proceed with subtotal graft substitution preserving the outflow stented segment of the HG, using an early cannulation graft to prevent CVC use. After this successful reconstruction, the patient started hemodialysis on the following day with no intercurrences registered. labels: #Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical#Graft Occlusion, Vascular#Humans#Kidney Failure, Chronic#Male#Middle Aged#Prosthesis Failure#Renal Dialysis#Reoperation#Retrospective Studies#Time Factors#Treatment Outcome"

b'Objective: To investigate the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1B gene (TNFRSF1B) polymorphism in relation to the outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Methods: One thousand six hundred and forty-five cases without HCV infection, 545 cases with HCV clearance, and 783 cases with chronic HCV infection were enrolled. TaqMan probe method was used to investigate genotype rs1061622 (T > G) and rs1061624 (G > A). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sites were genotyped and haplotypes were constructed to evaluate their relation with the outcome of HCV infection. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that there was no relation to the two SNPs with HCV infection susceptibility and chronicity (P > 0.05). Haplotype analysis showed that carrier TA had an increased susceptibility to HCV infection [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 1.30, P = 0.038)]. Carrier TA and GG haplotypes were conducive to chronic HCV infection (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.53, P = 0.006; OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.66, P = 0.026). Conclusion: The combinational effects of rs1061622 and rs1061624 in TNFRSF1B gene may increase the risk of HCV chronicity and infection. labels: #Genetic Predisposition to Disease#Genotype#Haplotypes#Hepatitis C#Humans#Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide#Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II'
