b'In this study, it was found that fulvic acid (FA) enhanced the contents of astaxanthin and lipids in Haematococcus pluvialis under high light and nitrogen starvation conditions by 2- and 1.2-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, the carbohydrate and chlorophyll contents were decreased by FA induction, whereas the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) as well as the expression of astaxanthin and lipid biosynthetic genes were increased. To further explore the interrelation between FA and the biosynthesis of astaxanthin and lipids, a metabolomics analysis of H. pluvialis by combined FA and abiotic stress exposure was conducted by using LC-MS/MS. The contents of some cytoprotective metabolites and signal molecules, including d-maltose, succinate, malic acid, melatonin (MT), and some amino acids, were increased under FA induction and abiotic stress conditions. These metabolites are intermediates in the TCA cycle and Calvin cycle, providing more precursors for the synthesis of astaxanthin and lipids. Moreover, the signal molecules might contribute to enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance. This study provided new insights into the regulatory mechanism of FA on astaxanthin and lipid accumulation in H. pluvialis. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Two TaqMan\xc2\xae qPCR assays were developed to specifically quantify the absolute abundance of Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris in mixed-species algal biofilms by targeting the psbA gene. Standard curves were developed with amplification efficiencies of 92.4% and 96.6% for S. obliquus and C. vulgaris, respectively, and an R2 value of 0.99 for both. Calibration curves for estimating absolute cell abundances resulted in slopes of 0.98 and 1.11 for C. vulgaris and S. obliquus, respectively, and an R2 value of 0.95 for both. The assays were applied to cultivated mixed-species biofilms and approximately 107 cells of each algal species were quantified when 107 cells were added into biofilms. The developed qPCR assays were concluded to be specific and accurate for the quantification of S. obliquus and C. vulgaris in mixed-species biofilms. This will contribute to the control and optimization of algal cultivation systems for the production of algal biofuels and bioproducts. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The effects of the combined treatment of fulvic acid (FA) and salinity stress on lipid production in Monoraphidium sp. QLY-1 at multiple levels was investigated in this study. The results indicated that the highest lipid content (59.53%) in QLY-1 was achieved by combining FA treatment and salinity stress. Compared with the control group and FA addition alone, the group treated with both FA and salinity stress had increased contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidases, and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the addition of FA enhanced the expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and key genes related to lipid biosynthesis in QLY-1 under salinity stress. Collectively, biochemical analyses indicated that ROS, NO, MAPK, expression of lipid biosynthesis-related genes and antioxidant systems were involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathways of QLY-1 under the combined treatment of FA and salinity stress. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The increasing use of nanoparticles (NPs) unavoidably enhances their unintended introduction into the aquatic systems, raising concerns about their nanosafety. This work aims to assess the toxicity of five oxide NPs (Al2O3, Mn3O4, In2O3, SiO2 and SnO2) using the freshwater alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata as a primary producer of ecological relevance. These NPs, in OECD medium, were poorly soluble and unstable (displayed low zeta potential values and presented the tendency to agglomerate). Using the algal growth inhibition assay and taking into account the respective 72\xe2\x80\xafh-EC50 values, it was possible to categorize the NPs as: toxic (Al2O3 and SnO2); harmful (Mn3O4 and SiO2) and non-toxic/non-classified (In2O3). The toxic effects were mainly due to the NPs, except for SnO2 which toxicity can mainly be attributed to the Sn ions leached from the NPs. A mechanistic study was undertaken using different physiological endpoints (cell membrane integrity, metabolic activity, photosynthetic efficiency and intracellular ROS accumulation). It was observed that Al2O3, Mn3O4 and SiO2 induced an algistatic effect (growth inhibition without loss of membrane integrity) most likely as a consequence of the cumulative effect of adverse outcomes: i) reduction of the photosynthetic efficiency of the photosystem II (?PSII); ii) intracellular ROS accumulation and iii) loss of metabolic activity. SnO2 NPs also provoked an algistatic effect probably as a consequence of the reduction of ?PSII since no modification of intracellular ROS levels and metabolic activity were observed. Altogether, the results here presented allowed to categorize the toxicity of the five NPs and shed light on the mechanisms behind NPs toxicity in the green alga P. subcapitata. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgal toxicity tests using integrative endpoints as algal growth are regularly required to analyse the toxicity of potentially hazardous substances in the aquatic environment. However, these do not provide mechanistic information on the toxic mode of action by which contaminants may affect algae. Bottled waters can be used as a substitute for culturing media and should not impose any stress to the cultured organisms. However, certain chemical components can interfere with specific cell targets which are not revealed by general toxicity assays. The present study investigated the sensitivity of flow cytometry (FCM) to analyse sub-lethal effects of different bottled waters to the freshwater microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata. Several endpoints were analysed including growth rate, natural pigments content, cell size, complexity, viability and cycle, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane potential and Lipid Peroxidation (LPO). Additionally, photosystem II (PSII) performance was analysed by PAM fluorometry, to provide further information on the absorption, distribution and use of energy in photosynthesis. Results indicated that the most sensitive endpoints were the oxidative stress related endpoints ROS formation and LPO, pigment content, morphological endpoints as cell size, complexity and cycle, with growth rate being one of the least sensitive. Although being essential macronutrients for algal growth, the chemical elements Ca, Na, Mg, and NH4 were identified as being primarily responsible for the observed toxicological effects to exposed algae. The applied methodology proved to be of high throughput, simultaneously assembling information on morphological, biochemical, and physiological status of algal cells. FCM also showed potential to reveal mechanistic information on the toxic mode of action of the bottled waters before any effects on algal growth was observed. The used approach demonstrated its potential for being integrated into future microalgal toxicity bioassays for testing chemicals to improve the hazard information obtained from currently approved internationally accepted test guidelines. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Haematococcus pluvialis is a prominent feedstock of astaxanthin. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) strongly influences the metabolic pathways of mixotrophic-grown microalgae, however, its role involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis is still not fully understood. In this study, integrative metabolic and physiologic profiles were analyzed in elucidating how C/N affected carbon and nitrogen assimilation and thereby exerted influence on astaxanthin biosynthesis. It was demonstrated that high C/N up-regulated the activities of acetate kinase by increase of 5.76 folds in early logarithmic phase, leading a significant increase of acetyl-CoA. The increased carbon skeletons were then funneled into astaxanthin biosynthesis. Additionally, high C/N increased the proportion of carotenoid-intermediates in cytoplasm from chloroplast. Finally, a fed-batch cultivation strategy based on C/N gradient was developed. Biomass attained 9.18\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1 in 100% type of immotile cyst cells, which presented astaxanthin productivity at 15.45\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL-1\xe2\x80\xafd-1 afterward, exhibiting a promising paradigm in commercial production. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'This work aimed to study the application of liquid biphasic flotation (LBF) for the efficient and rapid recovery of astaxanthin from H. pluvialis microalgae. The performance of LBF for the extraction of astaxanthin was studied comprehensively under different operating conditions, including types and concentrations of food-grade alcohol and salt, volume ratio, addition of neutral salt, flotation period, and mass of dried H. pluvialis biomass powder. The maximum recovery, extraction efficiency and partition coefficient of astaxanthin obtained from the optimum LBF system were 95.11\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf1.35%, 99.84\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.05% and 385.16\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf3.87, respectively. A scaled-up LBF system was also performed, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting natural astaxanthin from microalgae at a larger scale. This exploration of LBF system opens a promising avenue to the extraction of astaxanthin at lower cost and shorter processing time. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The effects of rhamnolipids (RLs) produced and further purified from Burkholderia thailandensis, on the unicellular microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta were investigated, in terms of RLs ability to affect algal growth, photosynthetic apparatus structure and energy flux, round and through photosystems II and I. Specifically, 24-48\xe2\x80\xafh RLs-treated algae (RLs at concentrations ranged from 5 to 50\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL-1) showed significantly decreased levels of growth rate, while increased levels of Chl a and b were obtained only in 72-96\xe2\x80\xafh RLs-treated algae. Similarly, although no changes were obtained in the Chl a/b ratio and almost all chlorophyll fluorescence parameters over time, yields of electron transport (?R0, ?E0) and respective performance index (PItotal) were negatively affected at 72 and 96\xe2\x80\xafh. Based on those findings, it seems that the inhibitory effect of RLs on the algae growth rate after 24 and 48\xe2\x80\xafh and the gradual attenuation of the phenomenon (after 72\xe2\x80\xafh of exposure), may indicate the initial response of the organism, as well as algae ability to overcome, since RLs showed no effects on algae photosynthetic ability. Those findings reveal for the first time that RLs from Burkholderia thailandensis are not harmful for Dunaliella tertiolecta. However, further studies with the use of more aquatic species could be essential for assessing the RLs-mediated effects on aquatic biota. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Haematococcus pluvialis is a main biological resource for the antioxidant astaxanthin production, however, potential modulators and molecular mechanisms underpinning astaxanthin accumulation remain largely obscured. We discovered that provision of ethanol (0.4%) significantly triggered the cellular astaxanthin content up to 3.85% on the 4th day of treatment. Amongst, 95% of the accumulated astaxanthin was esterified, particularly enriched with monoesters. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that ethanol altered cell wall structure and physiological properties. Antioxidant analyses revealed that astaxanthin accumulation offset the ethanol induced oxidative stress. Ethanol treatment reduced carbohydrates while increased lipids and jasmonic acid production. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered that ethanol orchestrated the expression of crucial genes involved in carotenogenesis, e.g. PSY, BKT and CRTR-b were significantly upregulated. Moreover, methyl jasmonic acid synthesis was induced and played a major role in regulating the carotenogenic genes. The findings uncovered the novel viewpoint in the intricate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of astaxanthin biosynthesis. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The suitability of integrating biological and thermal transformation of microalgal biomass to design a biorefinery was studied. The mixed cultivation of Chlorella sp. and Bracteacoccus sp. in city wastewater produced 12\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1 of biomass (0.77\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1\xe2\x80\xafday-1) and removed nitrates and phosphates by 68% and 75%, respectively. Microalgae outcompeted the contaminating microbes by raising the pH of wastewater to 9.93. The lipid-free residual biomass was pyrolyzed at four heating rates (10, 20, 30, 40\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C\xe2\x80\xafmin-1) which showed a three-stage pyrolysis. The activation energies (182-256\xe2\x80\xafkJ\xe2\x80\xafmol-1) and their corresponding lower enthalpies at the conversional fractions from 0.2 to 0.6 indicated that product formation was being favored. The values of pre-exponential factors (1015-17\xe2\x80\xafs-1), Gibbs free energy (159-190\xe2\x80\xafkJ\xe2\x80\xafmol-1) and entropy (43-81\xe2\x80\xafJ\xe2\x80\xafmol-1) showed efficient pyrolysis. The data may lead to establish a robust microalgal biorefinery to produce biomass and energy along with primary treatment of city wastewater. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Some metal-based engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) undergo fast dissolution and/or aggregation when they are released in the environment. The underlying processes are controlled by psychochemical/biological parameters of the environment and the properties of the particles. In this study, we investigated the interaction between algal cells and zero valent copper nanoparticles (Cu0-ENPs) to elucidate how the cells influence the dissolution and aggregation kinetics of the particles and how these kinetics influence the cellular uptake of Cu. Our finding showed that the concentration of dissolved Cu ([Cu]dissolved) in the supernatant of the culture media without algal cells was higher than the [Cu]dissolved in the media with algal cells. In the absence of the cells, dissolved organic matter (DOC) increased the dissolution of the particle due to increasing the stability of the particles against aggregation, thus increasing the available surface area. In the presence of algae, Cu0-ENPs heteroaggregated with the cells. Thus, the available surface area decreased over time and this resulted in a low dissolution rate of the particles. The DOC corona on the surface of the particles increased the heteroaggregation of the particles with the cells and decreases the uptake of the particles. Our findings showed that microorganisms influence the fate of ENPs in the environment, and they do so by modifying the dissolution and aggregation kinetics of the Cu0-ENPs. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Nordic microalgal strain Haematococcus pluvialis was exposed to various stress conditions to induce astaxanthin accumulation. Highest carotenoid content (19.1\xe2\x80\xafmg\xc2\xb7g-1dw) was achieved in nitrogen-free culture medium at a high light intensity. The efficiency of Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) pre-treatment of stressed fresh biomass of H. pluvialis followed by incubation in the growth medium was compared to classical disruption methods (bead-beating, freezing-thawing, thermal treatment or ultrasound) for the subsequent extraction of astaxanthin in ethanol. N-starved cells treated with PEF followed by aqueous incubation for 6\xe2\x80\xafh resulted in extraction of 96% (18.3 mgcar\xc2\xb7gdw-1) of the total carotenoid content compared to 80% (15.3 mgcar\xc2\xb7gdw-1) using other physical methods. The proportion of free forms of astaxanthin was higher in PEF-treated samples compared to mechanical disruption, suggesting PEF triggering an esterase activity. PEF pre-treatment of the cells followed by incubation in growth medium improved astaxanthin extraction in the eco-friendly solvent ethanol. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae are affected by the amount of light received. This parameter can be controlled by changing the light source and altering the reactor used for their growth. In this study, the effect of different colors of light was analyzed in the growth of Dunaliella tertiolecta, observing that blue lighting systems reached a biomass 10 times superior to the one generated by orange lightning systems. This growth effect was seen in a novel tubular internally illuminated photobioreactor. In this photobioreactor, the blue reactor produced 1.7 times the biomass of the red reactor, with the particularity that the latter showed an oscillating behavior in its growth. From irradiance models, the light dispersion coefficient is higher than the absorption coefficient when using red light. In contrast, with blue light, the value of the scattering coefficient is almost null. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'An actinomycete strain, TKZ-21T, was isolated from a freshwater alga (Chetophoraceae) collected from the Takizawa River, Yamanashi, Japan, and examined using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Cells were Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-sporulating, motile, and coccoid or short rod-shaped. The strain grew in the presence of 0-4\xe2\x80\x8a% (w/v) NaCl, between pH 6-9.4, and over a temperature range of 15-40\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C, with optimum growth at 30\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C. The peptidoglycan type of strain TKZ-21T was A4\xc3\xa2, containing l-ornithine as diagnostic diamino acid and d-glutamic acid as the interpeptide bridge. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H4). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, ninhydrin-positive glycolipid, and unidentified phospholipids. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15\xe2\x80\x8a:\xe2\x80\x8a0 and anteiso-C17\xe2\x80\x8a:\xe2\x80\x8a0, and the DNA G+C\xe2\x80\x89content was 75.6\xe2\x80\x89mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain TKZ-21T was closely related to Cellulomonas fimi (98.5\xe2\x80\x8a% sequence similarity) and Cellulomonas biazotea (98.3\xe2\x80\x8a%). The genome orthoANI value between strain TKZ-21T and C. biazotea and C. fimi were 84.7 and 84.2\xe2\x80\x8a%, respectively. On the basis of fatty acid and MALDI-TOF MS profile analysis, phylogenetic analyses, genomic analysis, and phenotypic data, it is proposed that the isolate be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Cellulomonas, with the name Cellulomonas algicola sp. nov. The type strain is TKZ-21T (=NBRC 112905T=TBRC 8129T). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In this study, the effects of strigolactone (SL) on the biomass, lipid content, biochemical properties, and gene transcription of Monoraphidium sp. QLY-1 were examined. The lipid content and lipid productivity increased by 61% and 55% in QLY-1 under 1\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\xacM SL induction compared to the control group, respectively. SL also upregulated the levels of endogenous NO and Ca2+ and lipid biosynthesis gene transcription. Subsequently, the relationship between Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of cell growth and lipid accumulation of QLY-1 under SL induction conditions was analysed. An increase in endogenous Ca2+ regulated cell growth and lipid biosynthesis by modulating the levels of NO and lipid biosynthesis-related gene expression. Collectively, this study provided a valuable approach for biofuel production from microalgae under SL induction and demonstrated that there is crucial crosstalk between the Ca2+ and NO signalling in the manipulation of lipid biosynthesis in microalgae under SL treatment. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Enhanced biosynthesis and overproduction of lipid and high-value bioproducts endows microalgae as a promising feedstock for the cost-effective development of advanced bioenergy currently. In this study, multilevel heuristic LED regimes, designed with the coordination of light, nitrogen and carbons in terms of cell physiology and morphology, have been implemented to significantly induce the growth and bioproducts accumulation of Haematococcus pluvialis under mixotrophic conditions. The white-red regime with C5 organic carbon showed a good potential for enhancing microalgal biomass and lipid synthesis, especially for saturated fatty acids. The astaxanthin biosynthesis has been significantly enhanced and the highest content of 3.3% was achieved with gluconate at the white-blue regime. Additionally, white-blue regime enhanced the protein content of H. pluvialis up to 45%, increased by 40% over the white-red culture. The multilevel LED protocol can be developed synergistically with the different adaptation and tolerance of algal cell physiology and morphology for target bioproducts. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) gene family plays a major role in glycerol synthesis and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Few studies on GPD family genes from the halotolerant algae Dunaliella salina are available. In this study, seven DsaGPD genes were identified by mining D. salina sequencing data. Among them, DsaGPD5 contained the canonical NAD+-GPD protein domain, called si-GPD. In comparison, DsaGPD1-4 not only contained the canonical NAD+-GPD domain but also a unique domain, the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like superfamily domain, in their N-terminal region, called bi-GPD. DsaGPD6, 7 contained the FAD+-GPD domain. In the transient expression system, DsaGPD1, 3, 4 were found in the cytosol of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast, DsaGPD2, 5 in the chloroplast, and DsaGPD6, 7 in the mitochondria. MEME analysis showed that six conserved motifs were present in both si-GPDs and bi-GPDs, whereas seven highly conserved motifs were only present in bi-GPDs. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed significant induction of the DsaGPD genes under abiotic stresses, indicating their tolerance-related role in D. salina. DsaGPD2 and DsaGPD5 may be the osmoregulator form and glyceride form in the chloroplast, respectively. The evolutionary forces acting on si-GPDs and bi-GPDs were different in the same organism: bi-GPDs were under purifying selection, while si-GPDs were mainly under positive selection. Furthermore, evolution of the N_HAD domain and C_GPD domain in bi-GPDs is highly correlated. In summary, this study characterizes DsaGPD gene family members and provides useful information for elucidating the salt tolerance mechanism in D. salina. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Lipid production in microalgae can be induced by various stress factors. However, stress induced lipid accumulation requires considerable time leading to the decrease in lipid productivity. Here, we attempted to increase the lipid productivity while maintaining the high growth of Ettlia sp. by optimizing nitrogen concentration and UV exposure in a continuous culture. The biomass and lipid productivities of Ettlia sp. cultured with 150\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafN\xe2\x80\xafL-1 and UV-A added PAR were 1.67\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.08\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1\xe2\x80\xafd-1 and 0.55\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.05\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1\xe2\x80\xafd-1, respectively. Lipid productivity and lipid content were around 43.7% and 33.7% higher, respectively in UV-A treatment compared to the control. Moreover, gene-expression patterns related to antioxidant defense and intracellular ROS levels indicated that UV-A affected certain ROS and antioxidants pathways and successfully induced the lipid accumulation in Ettlia sp. This strategy to activate lipid accumulation can be applied in other microalgae without affecting their growth. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Gold nanorods have shown to pose adverse effects to biota. Whether these effects may be potentiated through prolonged exposure has been rarely studied. Therefore, this work aimed at evaluating the effects of long-term exposure to sublethal levels of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) coated gold nanorods (Au-NR) on two freshwater microalgae: Chlorella vulgaris and Raphidocelis subcapitata. These algae were exposed to several concentrations of Au-NR for 72\xe2\x80\xafh and, afterwards, to the corresponding EC5,72h, for growth, during 16\xe2\x80\xafdays. The sensitivity of the two algae to Au-NR was assessed at days 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 (D0, D4, D8, D12 and D16, respectively) after a 72-h exposure to several concentrations of Au-NR. At the end of the assays, effects on yield and population growth rate were evaluated. Raphidocelis subcapitata was slightly more sensitive to Au-NR than C. vulgaris: EC50,72h,D0 for yield were 48.1 (35.3-60.9) and 70.5 (52.4-88.6) \xc3\xacg/L Au-NR, respectively while for population growth rate were above the highest tested concentrations (53 and 90\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\xacg/L, respectively). For R. subcapitata the long-term exposure to Au-NR increased its sensitivity to this type of nanostructures. For C. vulgaris, a decrease on the effects caused by Au-NR occurred over time, with no significant effects being observed for yield or population growth rate at D12 and D16. The capping agent CTAB caused reductions in yield above 30% (D0) for both algae at the concentration matching the one at the highest Au-NR tested concentration. When exposed to CTAB, the highest inhibition values were 69% (D4) and 21.3% (D8) for R. subcapitata, and 64% (D12) and 21% (D16) to C. vulgaris, for yield and population growth rate, respectively. These results suggested long-term exposures should be included in ecological risk assessments since short-term standard toxicity may either under- or overestimate the risk posed by Au-NR. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Retinoids are essential during early cardiovascular morphogenesis. However, recent studies showed their important role in cardiac remodeling in rats with hypertension and following myocardial infarction. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of zeaxanthin heneicosylate (ZH); a carotenoid ester isolated from Dunaliella salina microalgae, on cardiac dysfunction ensuing d-galactose injection in rats. Rats injected with d-GAL (200 mg/kg; I.P) for 8 weeks were orally treated with ZH (250 \xc3\xacg/kg) for 28 consecutive days. Results showed that d-GAL injection caused dramatic electrocardiographic changes as well as marked elevation in serum levels of homocysteine, creatinine kinase isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase. A reduction in the cardiac contents of glucose transporter-4 and superoxide dismutase along with the elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthetase and interleukin-6 was also noticed. Oral administration of ZH significantly improved the above mentioned cardiac aging manifestations; this was further emphasized through histopathological examinations. The effect of ZH is mediated through the interaction with retinoid receptor alpha (RAR-\xc3\xa1) as evidenced through a significant elevation of RAR-\xc3\xa1 expression in cardiac tissue following the lead of an in silico molecular docking study. In conclusion, zeaxanthin heneicosylate isolated from D. salina ameliorated age-associated cardiac dysfunction in rats through the activation of retinoid receptors. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'A two-step strategy was employed to culture Dunaliella tertiolecta, an oleaginous unicellular green alga, combined by the salt stress and sodium azide intervention, to observe their effects on its lipid accumulation. When the algae cultured at different salt concentrations reached the logarithmic growth phase, sodium azide was added. The results showed that the addition of sodium azide significantly increased the lipid content and had no significant effect on cell biomass. The lipid yield and single cell lipid content under 50\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\xacM sodium azide increased by 10.4% and 21.7%. Under the two-step culture condition, combining of the treatment of 50\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\xacM sodium azide and 2.5\xe2\x80\x89M salt stress, the total lipid productivity and single-cell lipid content were 10% and 70.5% higher than that of the control. It seemed that sodium azide and salinity might have a synergistic effect on the lipid accumulation of D. tertiolecta. It can be concluded that sodium azide is an effective inducer of lipid accumulation in D. tertiolecta, and two-stage cultivation is a feasible way to improve lipid accumulation in microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is the important precursors for triacylglycerol synthesis, while glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) determines the formation of G3P. In this study, two GDPH genes, Dtgdp1 and Dtgdp2 were isolated and identified from Dunaliella tertiolecta. The full-length Dtgdp1 and Dtgdp2 CDS were 2016 bp and 2094 bp, which encoded two putative protein sequences of 671 and 697 amino acids with predicted molecular weights of 73.64\xe2\x80\x89kDa and 76.73\xe2\x80\x89kDa, respectively. DtGDP1 and DtGDP2 both had a close relationship with those of algal and higher plants. DtGDP1 shared two conserved superfamily (A1 and A2) and four signature motifs (I-IV), and the DtGDP2 showed six signature domains (from motif I to VI) and DAO_C conserved family. Our previous work showed that the triethylamine intervention could greatly increase the triacylglycerol content (up to 80%) of D. tertiolecta. This study aims to investigate the effect of triethylamine on GPDH expression. Results showed that, when treated by triethylamine at 100\xe2\x80\x89ppm and 150\xe2\x80\x89ppm, the expression levels of Dtgdp1 and Dtgpd2 were increased to 5.121- and 56.964-fold compared with the control, respectively. Triethylamine seemed to enhance lipid metabolic flow by inducing the expressions of Dtgdp1 and Dtgdp2 to increase the lipid content, which provides a new insight into the desired pathway of lipid synthesis in algae through genetic engineering. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The allelopathic effects of Myriophyllum elatinoides on algal growth were investigated and potential allelochemicals secreted by Myriophyllum elatinoides were analyzed. Myriophyllum elatinoides were co-cultivated with different initial concentrations (105, 106, 107, 108, and 109 ind.\xc2\xb7L-1) of Microcystis aeruginosa and Selenastrum capricornutum. The optical density of each group was measured daily. The results showed that 2.5 g\xc2\xb7(200 mL)-1 of Myriophyllum elatinoides has significant inhibition effect on Microcystis aeruginosa growth with initial concentrations of 107 ind.\xc2\xb7L-1 and 108 ind.\xc2\xb7L-1. However, there was no significant inhibition on the growth of Selenastrum capricornutum. Through solvent extraction and GC-MS analysis, hexadecanoic acid was extracted and determined as an allelochemical in Myriophyllum elatinoides. Additionally, three potentially novel allelochemical compounds secreted by Myriophyllum elatinoides were determined as follows:3-ethyl-3-methylheptane, triethyl phosphate and dibutyl phthalate. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Carotenoids are implicated in alleviating ageing and age-related diseases in humans. While data from different carotenoids are mixed in their outcomes, those for 9-cis-\xc3\xa2-carotene indicate general positive effects, although basic data on its biological impact are limited. Here, we show that supplementation with 9-cis-\xc3\xa2-carotene in ageing Drosophila melanogaster improved mitochondrial function in terms of ATP production and whole-body respiration and extended mean lifespan. It also resulted in improved mobility. These data provide a potential biological rational for the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with 9-cis-\xc3\xa2-carotene. These effects may be based on the maintenance of a sound mitochondrial function. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae are a promising biofuel resource, but their high cost and low productivity hinder their commercial applications. In the present study, Monoraphidium sp. QLZ-3 was cultivated in walnut shell extracts (WSE) supplemented with carbon dioxide (CO2). Biomass was enhanced from 0.40\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1 to 1.18\xe2\x80\xafg\xe2\x80\xafL-1, and lipid content reached 49.54% in WSE-12% CO2 media. Biomass and lipid productivity reached 196.88 and 97.52\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL-1\xe2\x80\xafd-1, which were 1.33- and 1.57-fold higher than those of the control, respectively. The amount of carbohydrates increased, but the protein contents decreased. Furthermore, the application of CO2 promoted nutrient and polyphenol absorption and upregulated the expression levels of lipid biosynthetic genes of this WSE-cultivated alga. These results indicated that coupling WSE and CO2 could be an efficient strategy to enhance biofuel production by microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Isoprenoid diphosphates are important precursors actively participating in many downstream metabolisms; they are often in modified forms, e.g., protein-coupled or esterified form. Therefore, in vivo level of free isoprenoid diphosphates is quite low, ?0.07\xe2\x80\x89nmol/g fresh weight in plants. In order to directly measure the isoprenoid diphosphate pool during stress-induced accumulation of astaxanthin in Haematococcus pluvialis, the present study optimized several pretreatment procedures to enrich free isoprenoid diphosphates for high-pressure liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) detection. Specifically, different extraction solvents, e.g., water, methanol, chloroform, and mixture of water, methanol, and chloroform (1:1:1, V/V/V), and solid phase extraction (SPE) columns (OASIS@ WAX and HLB Cartridges) were compared; and gentle decoupling by NaOH or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was introduced to release free isoprenoid diphosphates. Results found that solvent mixture of water, methanol and chloroform (1:1:1, V/V/V) showed the highest extraction efficiency (RE) for five isoprenoid diphosphates, ranging from 76.83% to 92.43%; HLB column showed the balanced recoveries ranging from 75.29% to 87.54%; and incubation with low NaOH (?4.7\xe2\x80\x89mmol/L) at 4\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb0C significantly increased detectable isoprenoid diphosphates in algal cells, some of which were undetectable or in trace level before NaOH decoupling. The method was applied to H. pluvialis cells under various stresses. Low levels of isoprenoid diphosphates were determined in most of the stresses used, e.g., 0.19\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.09 to 0.98\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.06\xe2\x80\x89mg/g fresh weight (FW) for IPP/DMAPP, 0.35\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.07\xe2\x80\x89mg/g FW for GGPP and undetectable for FPP and GPP; while isoprenoid diphosphates were significantly accumulated in the dark to 3.27\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.05, 0.17\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.09, 1.81\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.16 and 0.58\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.07\xe2\x80\x89mg/g FW for IPP/DMAPP, GPP, FPP and GGPP, respectively. These results implied that isoprenoid diphosphates were exhausted by downstream carotenogenesis under stress. Our work emphasizes NaOH decoupling for exact quantitation of in vivo isoprenoid diphosphates. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Carotenoids are lipophilic pigments found in plants and algae, as well as some bacteria, archaea, and fungi that serve two functions-(1) as light harvesting molecules-primary carotenoids, and (2) as antioxidants, acting against reactive oxygen species\xe2\x81\xbbsecondary carotenoids. Because of their strong antioxidant properties, they are also valuable for the development of anti-aging and photo-protective cosmetic applications. Of particular interest is the carotenoid phytoene, for its colorless and UV absorption characteristics. In this study, we targeted a reduction of phytoene desaturase (PDS) activity with the pigment-inhibiting herbicide 1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridin-4-one (fluridone), which leads to the over-accumulation of phytoene in the recently characterized microalgal strain Chlorococcum sp. (UTEX B 3056). After post-incubation with fluridone, phytoene levels were measured at ~33 ug/mg cell tissue, as opposed to non-detectable levels in control cultures. Hence, the novel microalga Chlorococcum sp. is a viable candidate for the production of the high-value carotenoid phytoene and subsequent applications in cosmeceuticals, as well as more obvious nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Aedes aegypti mosquitos are widespread vectors of several diseases and their control is of primary importance for biological and environmental reasons, and novel safe insecticides are highly desirable. An eco-friendly photosensitizing magnetic nanocarrier with larvicidal effects on Aedes aegypti was proposed. The innovative core-shell hybrid nanomaterial was synthesized by combining peculiar magnetic nanoparticles (called Surface Active Maghemite Nanoparticles - SAMNs, the core) and chlorin-e6 as photosensitizer (constituting the shell) via self-assembly in water. The hybrid nanomaterial (SAMN@chlorin) was extensively characterized and tested for the photocidal activity on larvae of Aedes aegypti. The SAMN@chlorin core-shell nanohybrid did not present any toxic effect in the dark, but, upon light exposure, showed a higher photocidal activity than free chlorin-e6. Moreover, the eco-toxicity of SAMN@chlorin was determined in adults and neonates of Daphnia magna, where delayed toxicity was observed only after prolonged (?4\xe2\x80\xafh) exposure to intense light, on the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and on the duckweed Lemna minor on which no adverse effects were observed. The high colloidal stability, the physico-chemical robustness and the magnetic drivability of the core-shell SAMN@chlorin nanohybrid, accompanied by the high photocidal activity on Aedes aegypti larvae and reduced environmental concerns, can be proposed as a safe alternative to conventional insecticides. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The current commercial production of natural astaxanthin is mainly carried out using Haematococcus pluvialis vegetative cells in the "two-stage" batch mode. The motile vegetative cells are more sensitive to stress than nonmotile vegetative cells, thereby affecting the overall astaxanthin productivity in H. pluvialis cultures. In this study, we compared the differences between motile cells and nonmotile cells in astaxanthin productivity, morphological changes, the mortality rate, and the diameter of the formed cysts. The experimental design was achieved by two different types H. pluvialis cell under continuous light of 80 \xc3\xacmol photons m-2 s-1 for a 9-day induction period. The highest astaxanthin concentration of 48.42 \xc2\xb1 3.13\xe2\x80\x89mg L-1 was obtained in the nonmotile cell cultures with the highest the productivity of 5.04 \xc2\xb1 0.15\xe2\x80\x89mg L-1 day-1, which was significantly higher than that in the motile cell cultures. The microscopic examination of cell morphological showed a large number of photooxidative damaged cells occurring in the motile cell cultures, resulting in higher cell mortality rate (22.2 \xc2\xb1 3.97%) than nonmotile cell cultures (9.6 \xc2\xb1 0.63%). In addition, the analysis results of cell diameter statistics indicated that nonmotile cells were more conducive to the formation of large astaxanthin-rich cysts than motile cells. In conclusion, the works presented here suggest that the accumulation of astaxanthin was significantly improved by nonmotile cells of H. pluvialis, which provided a possibility of optimizing the existing H. pluvialis cultivation strategy for the industrial production. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Dunaliella salina is a green microalgae species industrially exploited for its capacity to produce important amounts of carotenoid pigments. However in low nitrogen conditions in which they produce these pigments, their concentration is low, which results in harvesting difficulties and high costs. In this work, we propose a new solution to efficiently harvest D.\xc2\xa0salina at the pre-industrial scale, using flocculation/flotation harvesting induced by NaOH addition in the medium. We first show, using numerical simulations and nanoscale atomic force spectroscopy experiments, that sweeping mechanism in formed magnesium hydroxide precipitate is only responsible for D.\xc2\xa0salina flocculation in hypersaline culture medium upon NaOH addition. Based on this understanding of the flocculation mechanism, we then evaluate the influence of several parameters related to NaOH mixing and magnesium hydroxide precipitation and show that NaOH concentration, mixing, and salinity of the medium can be optimized to achieve high flocculation/flotation harvesting efficiencies in laboratory-scale experiments. We finally successfully scale-up the data obtained at lab-scale to a continuous pre-industrial flotation pilot, and achieve up to 80% of cell recovery. This interdisciplinary study thus provides original results, from the nano to the pre-industrial scale, which allow the successful development of an efficient large-scale D.\xc2\xa0salina harvesting process. We thus anticipate our results to be the starting point for further optimization and industrial use of this flocculation/flotation harvesting technique. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'BACKGROUND: \xc3\xb9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are synthesized from \xc3\xa1-Linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3\xc3\xb93) and play important roles in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in mammal cells. ALA is an essential fatty acid which cannot be produced within the human body and must be acquired through diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel microalgal strain (HDMA-20) as a source of \xc3\xb9-3 PUFAs including ALA and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, C20:4\xc3\xb93).METHOD: Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequence was used to identify the microalga strain HDMA-20. Autotrophic condition was chosen to cultivate HDMA-20 to reduce the cultivation cost. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty acid composition of HDMA-20 lipid.RESULTS: A microalgal strain (HDMA-20) from Lake Chengfeng (Daqing, Heilongjiang province, China) was found to accumulate high content of \xc3\xb9-3 PUFAs (63.4% of total lipid), with ALA and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, C20:4\xc3\xb93) accounting for 35.4 and 9.6% of total lipid, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences suggested that the HDMA-20 belonged to genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S rDNA sequence information turned out to be new molecular record of Monoraphidium species. The biomass productivity and lipid content of HDMA-20 were also investigated under autotrophic condition. The biomass productivity of HDMA-20 reached 36.3\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89L-\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89day-\xe2\x80\x891, and the lipid contents was 22.6% of dry weight.CONCLUSION: HDMA-20 not only represent an additional source of ALA, but also a totally new source of ETA. The high content of \xc3\xb9-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, of HDMA-20, makes it suitable as a source of nutrition supplements for human health. In addition, HDMA-20 exhibited good properties in growth and lipid accumulation, implying its potential for cost-effective \xc3\xb9-3 PUFAs production in future. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Nanomechanical and structural characterisations of algal cells are of key importance for understanding their adhesion behaviour at interfaces in the aquatic environment. We examine here the nanomechanical properties and adhesion dynamics of the algal cells during two phases of their growth using complementary surface methods and the mathematical modelling. Mechanical properties of motile cells are hard to assess while keeping cells viable, and studies to date have been limited. Immobilisation of negatively charged cells to a positively charged substrate enables high-resolution AFM imaging and nanomechanical measurements. Cells were stiffer and more hydrophobic in the exponential than in the stationary phase, suggesting molecular modification of the cell envelope during aging. The corresponding properties of algal cells were in agreement with the increase of critical interfacial tensions of adhesion, determined amperometrically. Cells in exponential phase possessed a larger cell volume, in agreement with the large amount of amperometrically measured displaced charge at the interface. Differences in the kinetics of adhesion and spreading of cells at the interface were attributed to their various volumes and nanomechanical properties that varied during cell aging. Our findings contribute to the present body of knowledge on the biophysics of algal cells on a fundamental level. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'We examined the response of algal cells to laboratory-induced cadmium stress in terms of physiological activity, autonomous features (motility and fluorescence), adhesion dynamics, nanomechanical properties, and protein expression by employing a multimethod approach. We develop a methodology based on the generalized mathematical model to predict free cadmium concentrations in culture. We used algal cells of Dunaliella tertiolecta, which are widespread in marine and freshwater systems, as a model organism. Cell adaptation to cadmium stress is manifested through cell shape deterioration, slower motility, and an increase of physiological activity. No significant change in growth dynamics showed how cells adapt to stress by increasing active surface area against toxic cadmium in the culture. It was accompanied by an increase in green fluorescence (most likely associated with cadmium vesicular transport and/or beta-carotene production), while no change was observed in the red endogenous fluorescence (associated with chlorophyll). To maintain the same rate of chlorophyll emission, the cell adaptation response was manifested through increased expression of the identified chlorophyll-binding protein(s) that are important for photosynthesis. Since production of these proteins represents cell defence mechanisms, they may also signal the presence of toxic metal in seawater. Protein expression affects the cell surface properties and, therefore, the dynamics of the adhesion process. Cells behave stiffer under stress with cadmium, and thus, the initial attachment and deformation are slower. Physicochemical and structural characterizations of algal cell surfaces are of key importance to interpret, rationalize, and predict the behaviour and fate of the cell under stress in vivo. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'This study examined the effects of a bacterial community and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on Ettlia sp. flocculation. The growth rate, flocculation efficiency (FE), bacterial community, and EPS profile of axenic and xenic Ettlia cultures were monitored during 46\xe2\x80\xafdays of cultivation. For the xenic culture, with a great abundance of growth-promoting and flocculation-inducing bacteria, the biomass density was 18.75% higher and its FE reached 100% in the mid-stationary phase. Moreover, microscopic observation and a quantitative analysis of the EPS revealed the exclusive presence of long filamentous EPS and more compact structure in the xenic Ettlia culture, possibly explaining its better FE. Notwithstanding, for the axenic culture, despite a lower biomass density and reduced abundance of EPS, its FE reached 92.54% in the mid-stationary phase. Thus, the role of the bacterial community was found to be supportive rather than vital for the high settleability of the self-flocculating Ettlia microalgal culture. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Cryopreservation is a common methodology for long-term microalgae storage. Current cryopreservation methods are based on using diverse cryoprotectants and two-step cooling protocols, followed by sample storage at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (-\xe2\x80\x89196\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C). However, the use of this methodology requires a continuous liquid N2 supply as well as facilities with dedicated equipment, which is not affordable for every laboratory. In our work, we report on the successful development of a simple and cost-effective method for the long-term cryogenic storage of Tetradesmus obliquus at temperatures (-\xe2\x80\x8980\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) used in commonly available deep freezers that are more readily accessible to laboratories. Two procedures were evaluated that were originally devised for other microalgae; this was followed by the optimization of critical parameters such as the sample's microalgal concentration and the cryoprotectant reagent's incubation time. Cell viability was monitored using the survival rates obtained by direct agar plating and the growth recovery times in liquid cultures. Viability-related variables were recorded following different storage times of up to 3\xc2\xa0years. The main operational factors involved in the process (cell concentration, incubation time, and storage time) were statistically analyzed with regard to their influence on the survival rate. The statistical analysis showed interdependence (a two-factor interaction) between the cellular concentration and the cryoprotectant's incubation time, on the one hand, and between the incubation time and the storage time on the other. Survival rates above 70% were obtained under optimized conditions after 3\xc2\xa0months of storage, along with 20-35% viabilities after 3\xc2\xa0years. These results open up the possibility of extending this method to other Scenedesmaceae, or even other microalgal species, and for its use in resource-limited laboratories. labels: #Chlorophyceae"
b'An acidic cultivation strategy was developed to prevent contamination of a lethal fungus Paraphysoderma sedebokerensis in Haematococcus pluvialis culture for astaxanthin production. Instead of generally used neutral pH, an acidic condition (pH 4) was applied to the cultivation, resulting in a significant inhibition of the fungal contamination. This could be ascribed to the acidity-associated denaturation of a surface protein of P. sedebokerensis, which plays an important role in recognition of H. pluvialis. Stress relief strategies including stepwise light irradiation and naturally occurring nitrogen deficiency were employed in the induction stage to minimize the reduction of astaxanthin production caused by acidic pH. Accordingly, an astaxanthin titer of 84.8\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL-1 was obtained, which is 141-fold of that from the completely contaminated culture and double of that without the stress relief methods. This strategy provides a persistent contamination control method that can be used for practical astaxanthin production by H. pluvialis. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae may be exploited in water or wastewater treatment facilities to reduce excess concentrations of nutrients and metals to comply with regulatory limits. In this study, we characterized the growth and phosphorus (P) removal capacity of an isolated strain of Tetradesmus obliquus VRUC280. Investigations were carried out from laboratory scale (50\xe2\x80\xafmL) up to a 100\xe2\x80\xafL outdoor photobioreactor (PBR). After 10 days, batch cultures removed up to 74% of the media P, while in the PBR, 95% removal was achieved within five days. The harvested biomass was then inactivated (freeze-dried) and used for metal adsorption tests, employing solutions containing 6.0\xe2\x80\xafmg Cu L-1 or 4.8\xe2\x80\xafmg Ni L-1. Metal removal rates were evaluated after 15, 30, 60 and 120\xe2\x80\xafmin by the analysis of liquid and biomass metal contents. For the latter, a specific biomass digestion method was developed. Cu removal ranged between 50% and 65%, while for Ni, removal varied between 30% and 50%. 300-400\xe2\x80\xafmg Cu Kg DW-1 and 130-250\xe2\x80\xafmg Ni Kg DW-1 were rapidly adsorbed on the cell surface of T. obliquus (ca. 15-30\xe2\x80\xafmin incubations). This study demonstrates the potential of microalgae, in this case T. obliquus, to remove sequentially P and metals from aqueous media. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Recent molecular data has strongly suggested that field-collected cysts of snow algae that are morphologically identifiable as the zygotes of Chloromonas nivalis are composed of multiple species. Motile vegetative cells, however, have not been directly obtained from these cysts because of the difficulties involved in inducing their germination. Recently, our comparative molecular analyses, using both field-collected and cultured materials, demonstrated that one Japanese lineage of "C. nivalis zygotes" belongs to C. miwae. Herein, we examined another Japanese lineage of field-collected "C. nivalis zygotes" and a new strain originating from Japan. Our molecular data demonstrated that these two different life cycle stages are conspecific, and that they represent a new species that we herein describe as C. muramotoi sp. nov., based on the vegetative and asexual morphological characteristics of the strain. Multigene phylogenetic analyses showed that this new species was sister to C. miwae. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the cysts of C. muramotoi are different from those of C. miwae, based on the arrangement of the flanges developing on the cell wall. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'BACKGROUND: Astaxanthin is used as a functional nutraceutical and pigment in many food products. It is mostly exists in the form of a fatty acid ester in nature. However, no detailed descriptions are available concerning the stability and oral absorbability of astaxanthin esters. In the present study, the thermal stability and absorbability of astaxanthin esters from Haematococcus pluvialis were evaluated in comparison with free-form astaxanthin.RESULTS: The thermal stability of astaxanthin esters was found to be higher than that of free-form astaxantin. After gavage with astaxanthin esters, only free-form astaxanthin was detected in the digestive tract wall, blood plasma and liver, indicating that astaxanthin esters must be hydrolyzed to free-form astaxanthin in the gut before absorption. Furthermore, there was a considerable selective accumulation of different astaxanthin isomers in Balb/c mice, which selectivity decreased in the order: 13-cis\xc2\xa0>\xe2\x80\x89all-trans\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa09-cis. Accumulated astaxanthin was mainly distributed in the heart, liver, spleen, muscle and adipose tissue, although significant differences between tissues were observed.CONCLUSION: From the present study, it can be concluded that astaxanthin esters had a higher thermal stability and higher bioavailability than free-form astaxanthin. These results provide important evidence with respect to using astaxanthin esters as bioactive components to replace free-form astaxanthin in functional food products. \xc2\xa9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The interest of food industry to merchandise natural astaxanthin is growing up. However, it confronts scientific and technological challenges mainly related to its poor water solubility and chemical instability. Here, we present a new quick and efficient green process to simultaneously extract, encapsulate and stabilize astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis. The process is based on the hitherto unexplored combination of supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS), nanostructured liquids generated from amphiphiles through sequential self-assembly and coacervation, and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). These novel nanosystems were characterized by means of dynamic light scattering, AFM and cryoSEM, revealing spherical particles of ?100\xe2\x80\xafnm. Their antioxidant activity was measured by ORAC (20.6\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf3.9\xe2\x80\xaf\xc3\xacM TE) and \xc3\xa1-TEAC (2.92\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf0.58\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb5M \xc3\xa1-TE) assays and their in vitro capacity to inhibit ROS by DHE probe. Results showed that the SUPRAS-NLCs proposed yield high extraction and encapsulation efficiencies (71\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf4%) in combination with a remarkable time stability (180\xe2\x80\xafd, 4\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In this study, we estimated the toxicity risks from river sediments that were affected by multiple pollutants in the Haihe River Basin. We used a range of methods to determine the concentrations, bioavailability, and toxicity of a range of metals and contaminants in sediments and sediment porewater and then assessed the ecological risks and toxicity using various multivariate statistical approaches. We found that more than 70% of the samples were toxic. The concentrations of non-ionic ammonia (0.168-9.295\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL-1) were generally high in the sediment porewater, while the concentrations of bioavailable chromium (Cr) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also high in the porewater samples from NW01 and NW02, respectively. We used the toxic unit (TU) approach, based on the bioavailable pollutant concentrations, to determine the toxicity of PAHs, heavy metals, and non-ionic ammonia in river sediments and sediment porewater. We found that non-ionic ammonia was the main source of toxicity for Daphnia magna, and that Cr and zinc were toxic for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chironomus dilutus. By combining various indexes, we identified the main contributors to the toxicity in sediments collected from rivers affected by multiple pollutants. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The mitochondrial ATP synthase of Polytomella exhibits a peripheral stalk and a dimerization domain built by the Asa subunits, unique to chlorophycean algae. The topology of these subunits has been extensively studied. Here we explored the interactions of subunit Asa3 using Far Western blotting and subcomplex reconstitution, and found it associates with Asa1 and Asa8. We also identified the novel interactions Asa1-Asa2 and Asa1-Asa7. In silico analyses of Asa3 revealed that it adopts a HEAT repeat-like structure that points to its location within the enzyme based on the available 3D-map of the algal ATP synthase. We suggest that subunit Asa3 is instrumental in securing the attachment of the peripheral stalk to the membrane sector, thus stabilizing the dimeric mitochondrial ATP synthase. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Phycology has developed alongside light and electron microscopy techniques. Since the 1950s, progress in the field has accelerated dramatically with the advent of electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopes can only acquire imaging data on a 2D plane. Currently, many of the life sciences are seeking to obtain 3D images with electron microscopy for the accurate interpretation of subcellular dynamics. Three-dimensional reconstruction using serial sections is a method that can cover relatively large cells or tissues without requiring special equipment. Another challenge is monitoring secondary metabolites (such as lipids or carotenoids) in intact cells. This became feasible with hyperspectral cameras, which enable the acquisition of wide-range spectral information in living cells. Here, we review bioimaging studies on the intracellular dynamics of substances such as lipids, carotenoids and phosphorus using conventional to state-of-the-art microscopy techniques in the field of algal biorefining. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'BACKGROUD: Foliicolous algae are a common occurrence in tropical forests. They are referable to a few simple morphotypes (unicellular, sarcinoid-like or filamentous), which makes their morphology of limited usefulness for taxonomic studies and species diversity assessments. The relationship between algal community and their host phyllosphere was not clear. In order to obtain a more accurate assessment, we used single molecule real-time sequencing of the 18S rDNA gene to characterize the eukaryotic algal community in an area of South-western China.RESULT: We annotated 2922 OTUs belonging to five classes, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Dinophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae. Novel clades formed by large numbers sequences of green algae were detected in the order Trentepohliales (Ulvophyceae) and the Watanabea clade (Trebouxiophyceae), suggesting that these foliicolous communities may be substantially more diverse than so far appreciated and require further research. Species in Trentepohliales, Watanabea clade and Apatococcus clade were detected as the core members in the phyllosphere community studied. Communities from different host trees and sampling sites were not significantly different in terms of OTUs composition. However, the communities of Musa and Ravenala differed from other host plants significantly at the genus level, since they were dominated by Trebouxiophycean epiphytes.CONCLUSION: The cryptic diversity of eukaryotic algae especially Chlorophytes in tropical phyllosphere is very high. The community structure at species-level has no significant relationship either with host phyllosphere or locations. The core algal community in tropical phyllopshere is consisted of members from Trentepohliales, Watanabea clade and Apatococcus clade. Our study provided a large amount of novel 18S rDNA sequences that will be useful to unravel the cryptic diversity of phyllosphere eukaryotic algae and for comparisons with similar future studies on this type of communities. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The biosorption properties of water-soluble radioactive cesium (137Cs) by microalga Haematococcus pluvialis were evaluated with different cell conditions, and its cesium-uptake rate was compared with that by other microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris and Anabaena sp. Photo-induced H. pluvialis red cyst rapidly removed radioactive cesium from the solution by bioaccumulation. We showed that the effectiveness of 137Cs uptake is dependent on the specific cell condition of even the same microalgal species. While the H. pluvialis red cyst removed almost 95% of the soluble 137Cs in 48\xe2\x80\xafh, both H. pluvialis intermediate cells and C. vulgaris showed 90% uptake efficiency of 137Cs with slow uptake rate. The energy dispersive spectrometer data demonstrated that the cesium uptake acceleration by inducing astaxanthin in H. pluvialis red cyst involves the cesium accumulation through the potassium transport channel. The long-term monitoring experiments of the cesium uptake showed that only 40% of 137Cs remained in collapsed H. pluvialis cell fragments after 12 months. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In the present study, to improve the photosynthetic betacarotene productivity of Dunaliella salina, a blue-red LED wavelength-shifting system (B-R system) was investigated. Dunaliella salina under the B-R system showed enhanced density and beta-carotene productivity compared to D. salina cultivated under single light-emitting diode light wavelengths (blue, white, and red light-emitting diode). Additionally, we developed blue light-adapted D. salina (ALE-D. salina) using an adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach. In combination with the B-R system applied to ALE-D. salina (ALE B-R system), the beta-carotene concentration (33.94 \xc2\xb1 0.52 \xc3\xacM) was enhanced by 19.7% compared to that observed for the non-ALE-treated wild-type of D. salina (intact D. salina) under the B-R system (28.34 \xc2\xb1 0.24 \xc3\xacM). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Energy-saving, high-efficiency cell disruption is a critical step for recovery of thermolabile antioxidant astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis cyst cells of rigid cell-wall structure. In this study, as room-temperature green solvents, 10 types of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([Emim])-based ionic liquids (ILs) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to disrupt H. pluvialis cyst cells for astaxanthin/lipid extraction. Among the 10 ILs tested, 3 [Emim]-based ILs with HSO4, CH3SO3, and (CF3SO2)2N anions were selected based on astaxanthin/lipid extraction performance and synthesis cost. When pretreated with IL/water mixtures, intact cyst cells were significantly torn, broken or shown to release cytoplasmic components, thereby facilitating subsequent separation of astaxanthin/lipid by hexane. However, excess IL pretreatments at high temperature/IL dosages and longer incubation times significantly deteriorated lipid and/or astaxanthin. Under optimized mild conditions (6.7% (v/v) IL in water solution, 30\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C, 60\xe2\x80\xafmin), almost complete astaxanthin recoveries (>99%) along with moderate lipid extractions (?82%) could be obtained. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Both the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity data on aquatic organisms are indispensable parameters in the ecological risk assessment priority chemical screening process (e.g. persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals). However, most of the present modelling actions are focused on developing predictive models for the acute toxicity of chemicals to aquatic organisms. As regards chronic aquatic toxicity, considerable work is needed. The major objective of the present study was to construct in silico models for predicting chronic toxicity data for Daphnia magna and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. In the modelling, a set of chronic toxicity data was collected for D. magna (21 days no observed effect concentration (NOEC)) and P. subcapitata (72 h NOEC), respectively. Then, binary classification models were developed for D. magna and P. subcapitata by employing the k-nearest neighbour method (k-NN). The model assessment results indicated that the obtained optimum models had high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The model application domain was characterized by the Euclidean distance-based method. In the future, the data gap for other chemicals within the application domain on their chronic toxicity for D. magna and P. subcapitata could be filled using the models developed here. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae are key test organisms to assess the effects of chemicals on aquatic ecosystems. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as a widely used metal oxide is considered a potential threat to these primary producers at the base of the food chain. This study investigates the toxicity of ZnO NPs, bulk ZnO, and Zn2+ to the representative of freshwater microalgae, Raphidocelis subcapitata. To examine the effect of shape and size of nanoparticles, two types of spherical ZnO NPs with different sizes (20 and 40\xc2\xa0nm) and two types of rod-shaped ZnO NPs with different lengths (100 and 500\xc2\xa0nm) were synthesized. Microalgal cells were exposed to eight concentrations of each ZnO NP type from 0.01 to 0.7\xc2\xa0mg/L for 96\xc2\xa0h. The results showed that 0.7\xc2\xa0mg/L of ZnO NP could completely inhibit algal growth. Size did not interfere with toxicity in spherical ZnO NPs, but the toxicity decreased by increasing the size of rod-shaped ZnO NPs. Spherical ZnO NPs acted more destructive to microalgal cells than nanorod shape. The addition of 0.7\xc2\xa0mg/L of ZnO nanorods to samples caused 30% cell death, while 50% cell death was observed by adding the same concentration of nanospherical ZnO. Nano ZnO revealed to be more toxic than bulk ZnO and Zn2+. The Zn2+ released from dissolution of ZnO NPs was one of the sources of toxicity, but the ZnO nanostructures were also an important factor in the toxicity. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The indigenous microalga, Desmodesmus sp. produced alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) rich lipids in response to low temperature and UV treatment. Incubation at 5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C showed a 1.5 fold increase in lipid content (34% w/w) with 44% ALA fraction of total fatty acids. The UV treatment (UV 60\xe2\x80\xafmin) exhibited a 1.4 fold increase in biomass productivity and 1.6 fold increase in lipid content (37% w/w) with ALA fraction as 31% of total fatty acids. The nitrogen stress enhanced the lipid content (39% w/w) with a reduced ALA fraction (18%) of total fatty acids. The UV treated cultures (UV 40 and 60\xe2\x80\xafmin) on incubation at 5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb0C showed maximum lipid accumulation (59 to 62% w/w) with ALA fraction of total fatty acids as 39 to 42%. The incubation of nutrient-replete and UV treated cultures at low-temperature could therefore be used for the production of ALA-rich lipids in microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Astaxanthin (Asta), red pigment of the carotenoid family, is known for its anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Asta on isolated human sperm in the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 capsid protein, L1. Sperm, purified by gradient separation, were treated with HPV16-L1 in both a dose and time-dependent manner in the absence or presence of 30 min-Asta pre-incubation. Effects of HPV16-L1 alone after Asta pre-incubation were evaluated by rafts (CTB) and Lyn dislocation, Tyr-phosphorylation (Tyr-P) of the head, percentages of acrosome-reacted cells (ARC) and endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Sperm membranes were also analyzed for the HPV16-L1 content. Results show that HPV16-L1 drastically reduced membrane rearrangement with percentage of sperm showing head CTB and Lyn displacement decreasing from 72% to 15.8%, and from 63.1% to 13.9%, respectively. Accordingly, both Tyr-P of the head and ARC decreased from 68.4% to 10.2%, and from 65.7% to 14.6%, respectively. Asta pre-incubation prevented this drop and restored values of the percentage of ARC up to 40.8%. No alteration was found in either the ROS generation curve or sperm motility. In conclusion, Asta is able to preserve sperm by reducing the amount of HPV16-L1 bound onto membranes. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Astaxanthin and lutein, antioxidants used in nutraceutics and cosmetics, can be extracted from several microalgal species. In this work, investigations on astaxanthin and lutein extraction from Haematococcus pluvialis (H. pluvialis) in the red phase were carried out by means of the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) technique, in which CO\xe2\x82\x82 supercritical fluid was used as the extracting solvent with ethanol as the co-solvent. The experimental activity was performed using a bench-scale reactor in semi-batch configuration with varying extraction times (20, 40, 60, and 80 min), temperatures (50, 65, and 80 \xc2\xb0C) and pressures (100, 400, and 550 bar). Moreover, the performance of CO\xe2\x82\x82 SFE with ethanol was compared to that without ethanol. The results show that the highest astaxanthin and lutein recoveries were found at 65 \xc2\xb0C and 550 bar, with ~18.5 mg/g dry weight (~92%) astaxanthin and ~7.15 mg/g dry weight (~93%) lutein. The highest astaxanthin purity and the highest lutein purity were found at 80 \xc2\xb0C and 400 bar, and at 65 \xc2\xb0C and 550 bar, respectively. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Silver nanomaterials (AgNMs) of different shapes and sizes are potentially toxic to aquatic organisms. However, studies on the toxicity of AgNMs and on their shape-dependent effects on algae are scarce. The present study evaluated the effects of three AgNMs (silver nanospheres, AgNPs; silver nanowires, AgNWs; silver nanoplates, AgPLs) with different shapes coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone on the growth and photosynthetic performance of an alga, Chlorococcum infusionum. We used growth measurements and determined the photosynthetic parameters based on chlorophyll fluorescence transients in the algal cells exposed to different concentrations of the three AgNMs. The effective concentrations at 50% (EC50) of AgNPs, AgNWs, and AgPLs were calculated to be 0.1, 0.045, and 0.021\xe2\x80\xafmg/L, respectively. The results showed that the toxicity of AgNMs in C. infusionum was in the order, AgPLs (40\xe2\x80\xafnm diameter) >\xe2\x80\xafAgNWs (21,000\xe2\x80\xafnm length ? 42\xe2\x80\xafnm diameter) >\xe2\x80\xafAgNPs (57\xe2\x80\xafnm diameter), based on the decrease in growth and three photosynthetic activities. We propose that the toxic potential of AgNMs is primarily dependent on their diameter and secondarily on their shape. Overall, this study provides, for the first time, a comparison of the growth and photosynthetic activities of C. infusionum exposed to AgNMs of three different shapes. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Natural astaxanthin mainly derives from a microalgae producer, Haematococcus pluvialis. The induction of nitrogen starvation and high light intensity is particularly significant for boosting astaxanthin production. However, the different responses to light intensity and nitrogen starvation needed to be analyzed for biomass growth and astaxanthin accumulation. The results showed that the highest level of astaxanthin production was achieved in nitrogen starvation, and was 1.64 times higher than the control group at 11 days. With regard to the optimization of light intensity utilization, it was at 200 \xc3\xacmo/m\xc2\xb2/s under nitrogen starvation that the highest astaxanthin productivity per light intensity was achieved. In addition, both high light intensity and a nitrogen source had significant effects on multiple indicators. For example, high light intensity had a greater significant effect than a nitrogen source on biomass dry weight, astaxanthin yield and astaxanthin productivity; in contrast, nitrogen starvation was more beneficial for enhancing astaxanthin content per dry weight biomass. The data indicate that high light intensity synergizes with nitrogen starvation to stimulate the biosynthesis of astaxanthin. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In the present work, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have been developed for ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals on four different aquatic species namely Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Daphnia magna, Oncorhynchus mykiss and Pimephales promelas using genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection followed by Partial Least Squares regression technique according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Double cross-validation methodology was employed for selecting suitable models. Only 2D descriptors were used for capturing chemical information and model building, whereas validation of the models was performed by considering various stringent internal and external validation metrics. Interestingly, models could be developed even without using any LogP terms in contrary to the usual dependence of toxicity on lipophilicity. However, the current manuscript proposes highly robust and more predictive models employing computed logP descriptors. The applicability domain study was performed in order to set a predefined chemical zone of applicability for the obtained QSAR models, and the test compounds falling outside the domain were not taken for further analysis while making a prioritized list. An additional comparison was made with ECOSAR, an online expert system for toxicity prediction of organic pollutants, in order to prove predictability of the obtained models. The obtained robust consensus models were utilized to predict the toxicity of a large dataset of approximately 9300 drug-like molecules in order to prioritize the existing drug-like substances in accordance to their acute predicted aquatic toxicities following a scaling technique. Finally, prioritized lists of 500 most toxic chemicals obtained by respective consensus models and those predicted from ECOSAR tool have been reported. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Plant factories have been developed to replace traditional agriculture, aiming to solve future problems of food availability. However, the nutrient solution in a plant factory is discharged after a single batch of plant cultivation, giving rise to large amounts of waste nutrient solution. Microalgae can be used to treat a wide variety of wastewater and effectively remove excessive nutrients from wastewater. Therefore, the incorporation of microalgal cultivation into a plant factory to treat waste nutrients would be a reasonable approach facilitating removal of waste nutrients with concomitant production of algal biomass. In this study, we isolated novel microalgal species suitable for the growth in waste nutrients from a plant factory and subsequently an underwater LED photobioreactor was constructed being incorporated into the plant factory system. Finally, treated waste nutrient solution was recycled back into the plant factory and successfully used for the cultivation of plant of butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Nowadays, consumers are more conscious about healthier products consumption benefits. Astaxanthin obtained from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis represents a natural ingredient for the nutraceutical and functional food industries. It is claimed that astaxanthin has much stronger antioxidant activity than vitamin E and \xc3\xa2-carotene, providing different health benefits. However, the unstable structure of the molecule limits its application in functional foods development. Therefore, the present study evaluates the effect of five independent formulation and process variables for natural astaxanthin oleoresin encapsulation using an external ionic gelation technique. Response surface methodology can be used for studying the effect of several factors at different levels and their influences on each other, which overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional orthogonal method. The results showed that alginate and CaCl2 concentrations have a significant effect on particles size obtained, while alginate/oleoresin ratio and surfactant concentration greatly influence the astaxanthin oleoresin release rate. In vitro studies under simulated intestinal conditions showed that astaxanthin oleoresin release process can be described by Hopfenberg model. Three mathematical models were obtained for predicting particle size, astaxanthin release rate and encapsulation yield under different process conditions, providing a platform for microencapsulation technology optimization for healthy food design. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The overwhelming response towards algal biodiesel production has been well-recognized recently as a sustainable alternative to conventional fuels. Most microalgae cannot grow well at acidic pH. The present study, therefore, investigated whether non-acidophilic microalgae Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp. MAS3 can be acclimated to extreme-acidic pH for sustainable production of biomass and biodiesel. Growth analysis indicated that both the microalgal strains possessed a passive uptake of CO2 at pH 3.0 with biomass production of 0.25\xe2\x80\xafg dry\xe2\x80\xafwt.\xe2\x80\xafL-1 in Desmodemus sp. and 0.45\xe2\x80\xafg dry\xe2\x80\xafwt.\xe2\x80\xafL-1 in Heterochlorella sp.. Flow-cytometry analysis for reactive oxygen species, membrane permeability and neutral-lipids revealed the capabilities of both strains to adapt to the stress imposed by acidic pH. Lipid production was doubled in both the strains when grown at pH 3.0. In-situ transesterification of biomass resulted in 13-15% FAME yield in the selected microalgae, indicating their great potential in biofuel production. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'In the green algal order Volvocales (Chlorophyceae), flagellate colonial forms have evolved at least four times. One of these colonial lineages, Tetrabaenaceae-Goniaceae-Volvocaceae (TGV), which belongs to the clade Reinhardtinia, is closely related to several unicellular chlamydomonads in the genera Chlamydomonas and Vitreochlamys. However, the unicellular sister of TGV has not been specified. Here, the largest ever 18S rRNA phylogenetic tree of Reinhardtinia was constructed including several newly isolated chlamydomonads, and a clade (core-Reinhardtinia) including 32 unicellular lineages and three colonial families were recognized. Interrelationships within core-Reinhardtinia were barely resolved in the tree, and therefore combined 18S-atpB-psaA-psaB-psbC-rbcL gene phylogenetic analyses were performed with selected representatives of 29 of the 32 unicellular lineages and three colonial families. The 29 unicellular lineages were clustered into five metaclades and an unassigned lineage; the metaclade that includes Chlamydomonas pila was resolved, with moderate support, as the sister clade to TGV. To examine possible biases from specific gene(s), long-branch taxa, and the heterogeneous base composition, phylogenetic analyses using several smaller data sets were also performed. Light microscopy of C. pila and its relatives indicated that any early steps towards colony evolution appeared after divergence of TGV from the C. pila lineage. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae cultivation in wastewater media in phototrophic condition is a promising approach for integrated CO2 biofixation and wastewater treatment. For this, Neochloris oleoabundans was used to investigate the tertiary treatment of wastewater along with CO2 biofixation. In this investigation, biomass productivity, CO2 biofixation rate and percentage of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) removal from synthetic wastewater are considered under three different operating conditions: temperature, CO2 feed concentration and nitrogen to phosphorus (NP) ratio in the media. Cultivation of N. oleoabundans was found to be highly temperature sensitive. With the increase of cultivation temperature from 25 to 45\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, declining trends of biomass concentration, productivity and percentage of TN and TP removal were observed. Cultivation temperature of 25\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C was found to be most favorable in terms of biomass productivity, CO2 biofixation rate, percentage of TN and TP removal of 92 (mg L-1\xc2\xa0day-1), 145 (mg L-1\xc2\xa0day-1), 100% and 32%, respectively. Arrhenius-type kinetic model was used and the model showed good agreement with the experimental findings. Activation energy for the active stage and decay stage was found to be [Formula: see text]\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8988.8 kJ\xc2\xa0mol-1 and [Formula: see text]\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x898.4 kJ\xc2\xa0mol-1, respectively. With the increase of CO2 feed concentration, biomass productivity increased and the maximum biomass concentration and productivity was achieved at 6%. After that with the increase in CO2, a declining trend was observed. With the increase of NP ratio from 1:1 to 2:1, both the biomass productivity and CO2 biofixation were increased, but later were subsequently decreased with increase of NP ratio from 4:1 to 8:1. It is interesting that TP removal was increased with NP ratio and 100 percent of TP removal was achieved at 4:1 and 8:1 conditions. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Haematococcus pluvialis microalgae in the red phase can produce significant amounts of astaxanthin, lutein, and fatty acids (FAs), which are valuable antioxidants in nutraceutics and cosmetics. Extraction of astaxanthin, lutein, and FAs from disrupted biomass of the H. pluvialis red phase using carbon dioxide (CO\xe2\x82\x82) in supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) conditions was investigated using a bench-scale reactor in a semi-batch configuration. In particular, the effect of extraction time (20, 40, 60, 80, and 120 min), CO\xe2\x82\x82 flow rate (3.62 and 14.48 g/min) temperature (50, 65, and 80 \xc2\xb0C), and pressure (100, 400, and 550 bar.) was explored. The results show the maximum recovery of astaxanthin and lutein achieved were 98.6% and 52.3%, respectively, at 50 \xc2\xb0C and 550 bars, while the maximum recovery of FAs attained was 93.2% at 65 \xc2\xb0C and 550 bars. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae cultivation is a promising approach to remove ambient CO2 via photosynthesis process. This paper investigates the impact of high CO2 concentrations (6, 12, and 16%) on algae growth, CO2 biofixation, lipid and carbohydrate contents, and nutrient removal of newly isolated microalgae, Coelastrum sp. SM. In addition, the ability of microalgae to produce biodiesel at optimal condition was studied. The microalgae were cultivated in wastewater using an airlift photobioreactor. Under 12% CO2, the maximum biomass productivity and CO2 fixation rate were 0.267\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L-1\xc2\xa0day-1 and 0.302\xc2\xa0g\xc2\xa0L-1\xc2\xa0h-1, respectively. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorous (TP), nitrate, and sCOD removal efficiency were 84.01, 100, 86.811, and 73.084%, respectively. Under 12% CO2 and at the same condition for cell growth, the highest lipid and carbohydrate contents were 3 7.91 and 58.45%, respectively. The composition of fatty acids methyl ester (FAME) of the microalga lipid was defined. Based on the obtained results and FAME profile, Coelastrum sp. SM was a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production and also, the organism had a great potential for CO2 biofixation, which is also more suitable than any other reported strains in other related studies. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Carpathian Basin is a lowland plain located mainly in Hungary. Due to the nature of the bedrock, alluvial deposits, and a bowl shape, many lakes and ponds of the area are characterized by high alkalinity. In this study, we characterized temporal changes in eukaryal and bacterial community dynamics with high throughput sequencing and relate the changes to environmental conditions in Lake Velence located in Fej?r county, Hungary. The sampled Lake Velence microbial populations (algal and bacterial) were analyzed to identify potential correlations with other community members and environmental parameters at six timepoints over 6\xc2\xa0weeks in the Spring of 2012. Correlations between community members suggest a positive relationship between certain algal and bacterial populations (e.g. Chlamydomondaceae with Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria), while other correlations allude to changes in these relationships over time. During the study, high nitrogen availability may have favored non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, such as the toxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa, and the eutrophic effect may have been exacerbated by high phosphorus availability as well as the high calcium and magnesium content of the Carpathian Basin bedrock, potentially fostering exopolymer production and cell aggregation. Cyanobacterial bloom formation could have a negative environmental impact on other community members and potentially affect overall water quality as well as recreational activities. To our knowledge, this is the first prediction for relationships between photoautotrophic eukaryotes and bacteria from an alkaline, Hungarian lake. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Size determines the rate at which organisms acquire and use resources but it is unclear what size should be favoured under unpredictable resource regimes. Some theories claim smaller organisms can grow faster following a resource pulse, whereas others argue larger species can accumulate more resources and maintain growth for longer periods between resource pulses. Testing these theories has relied on interspecific comparisons, which tend to confound body size with other life-history traits. As a more direct approach, we used 280 generations of artificial selection to evolve a 10-fold difference in mean body size between small- and large-selected phytoplankton lineages of Dunaliella tertiolecta, while controlling for biotic and abiotic variables. We then quantified how body size affected the ability of this species to grow at nutrient-replete conditions and following periods of nitrogen or phosphorous deprivation. Overall, smaller cells showed slower growth, lower storage capacity and poorer recovery from phosphorous depletion, as predicted by the 'fasting endurance hypothesis'. However, recovery from nitrogen limitation was independent of size-a finding unanticipated by current theories. Phytoplankton species are responsible for much of the global carbon fixation and projected trends of cell size decline could reduce primary productivity by lowering the ability of a cell to store resources. labels: #Chlorophyceae"
b'The present study investigated how principal environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity change the toxicological properties of thiobencarb (TB) herbicide to the green alga, Raphidocelis subcapitata. At first, we investigated the inhibitory effect of TB (0, 15.6, 31.2, 62.4, and 125\xc2\xa0\xc3\xacg\xc2\xa0L-1) on growth of R. subcapitata at five temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, or 30\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) for 144\xc2\xa0h exposure and calculated 72- and 144-h effective concentration values (EC10, 20, and EC50) for growth rate. All EC values significantly decreased with an increasing temperature. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II in R. subcapitata exposed to 125\xc2\xa0\xc3\xacg\xc2\xa0L-1 of TB was also significantly inhibited with increased temperature. These physiological effects could explain the lower EC values at high temperatures. Then, single and interactive effects of TB, temperature, and light intensity on growth rate were investigated by three-way of analysis of variance. As a result, single and interactive effects were detected in all explanatory variables. These results suggest that temperature and light intensity change the acute toxicity parameter in R. subcapitata exposed to TB and must be considered in evaluating the risk of TB. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Chytrids are early diverging lineages of true fungi that reproduce with posteriorly uniflagellate zoospores. In aquatic ecosystems, parasitic chytrids of algae have important ecological roles by influencing the population dynamics of phytoplankton and transferring nutrients and energy from inedible algae to zooplankton via zoospores. Despite their ecological importance, information on parasitic chytrids is lacking in the current systematics of chytrids. Here, we investigated a novel chytrid culture KS100 that parasitizes the green alga, Microglena coccifera (Volvocales). A cross-inoculation experiment revealed that KS100 infection was specific to the genus Microglena. Thallus morphology of KS100 is characterized by spherical or subspherical zoosporangium, which becomes slightly angular during zoospore discharge, 2-3 small and inoperculate pores from where zoospores are discharged, and rhizoids branching at the base that extends in a fan-like shape. This combination of characteristics was distinct from any other known chytrids. In molecular phylogeny, KS100 was placed in the order Rhizophydiales and was distinguished from any known families in the order. Zoospores of KS100 possessed a kinetosome-associated structure whose morphology and positioning were unique among the Rhizophydiales. Based on these results, we describe this chytrid as Collimyces mutans gen. et sp. nov. in the new family Collimycetaceae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'A novel imaging-driven technique with an integrated fluorescence signature to enable automated enumeration of two species of cyanobacteria and an alga of somewhat similar morphology to one of the cyanobacteria is presented to demonstrate proof-of-concept that high accuracy, imaging-based, rapid water quality analysis can be with conventional equipment available in typical water quality laboratories-this is not currently available. The results presented herein demonstrate that the developed method identifies and enumerates cyanobacterial cells at a level equivalent to or better than that achieved using standard manual microscopic enumeration techniques, but in less time, and requiring significantly fewer resources. When compared with indirect measurement methods, the proposed method provides better accuracy at both low and high cell concentrations. It extends the detection range for cell enumeration while maintaining accuracy and increasing enumeration speed. The developed method not only accurately estimates cell concentrations, but it also reliably distinguishes between cells of Anabaena flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Ankistrodesmus in mixed cultures by taking advantage of additional contrast between the target cell and complex background gained under fluorescent light. Thus, the proposed image-driven approach offers promise as a robust and cost-effective tool for identifying and enumerating microscopic cells based on their unique morphological features. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'A method to simultaneously extract polar (PC) and non-polar compounds (NPC) from microalgae was developed for further determination of intracellular metabolites by gas chromatography. The proposed method was validated and used to characterize two Chlorophyceae, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus, and two Cyanobacteria, Aphanothece microscopica Nag?li and Phormidium autumnale. The compounds were extracted with a reduced amount of organic solvent mixture (methanol-chloroform), compared to the reference method, under different conditions of homogenization and/or cell disruption. The NPC were derivatized by acid catalysis, whereas the PC fraction was derivatized using N-methyl,N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) in alkaline medium. The following parameters for method validation were considered: selectivity, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), precision, and accuracy. All methods of homogenization and cell disruption extracted both PC and NPC from Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Derivatization of PC presented satisfactory validation parameters. Eleven fatty acids, six free amino acids, and three organic acids were found within the evaluated microalgae species, succinic, malic, and citric acids, important intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glutamic acid was the amino acid found in greatest quantities in all species. Chlorophyceae presented a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, while Cyanobacteria had more saturated fatty acids. Thus, the proposed method was suitable to metabolically characterize both PC and NPC from microalgae. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Sphaeropleales are a dominant group of green algae, which contain species important to freshwater ecosystems and those that have potential applied usages. In particular, Raphidocelis subcapitata is widely used worldwide for bioassays in toxicological risk assessments. However, there are few comparative genome analyses of the Sphaeropleales. To reveal genome evolution in the Sphaeropleales based on well-resolved phylogenetic relationships, nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid genomes were sequenced in this study. The plastid genome provides insights into the phylogenetic relationships of R. subcapitata, which is located in the most basal lineage of the four species in the family Selenastraceae. The mitochondrial genome shows dynamic evolutionary histories with intron expansion in the Selenastraceae. The 51.2 Mbp nuclear genome of R. subcapitata, encoding 13,383 protein-coding genes, is more compact than the genome of its closely related oil-rich species, Monoraphidium neglectum (Selenastraceae), Tetradesmus obliquus (Scenedesmaceae), and Chromochloris zofingiensis (Chromochloridaceae); however, the four species share most of their genes. The Sphaeropleales possess a large number of genes for glycerolipid metabolism and sugar assimilation, which suggests that this order is capable of both heterotrophic and mixotrophic lifestyles in nature. Comparison of transporter genes suggests that the Sphaeropleales can adapt to different natural environmental conditions, such as salinity and low metal concentrations. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms widely used for the production of highly valued compounds, and recently they have been shown to be promising as a system for the heterologous expression of proteins. Several transformation methods have been successfully developed, from which the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method remains the most promising. However, microalgae transformation efficiency by A. tumefaciens is shown to vary depending on several transformation conditions. The present study aimed to establish an efficient genetic transformation system in the green microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta using the A. tumefaciens method. The parameters assessed were the infection medium, the concentration of the A. tumefaciens and co-culture time. As a preliminary screening, the expression of the gusA gene and the viability of transformed cells were evaluated and used to calculate a novel parameter called Transformation Efficiency Index (TEI). The statistical analysis of TEI values showed five treatments with the highest gusA gene expression. To ensure stable transformation, transformed colonies were cultured on selective medium using hygromycin B and the DNA of resistant colonies were extracted after five subcultures and molecularly analyzed by PCR. Results revealed that treatments which use solid infection medium, A. tumefaciens OD600\xe2\x80\xaf=\xe2\x80\xaf0.5 and co-culture times of 72\xe2\x80\xafh exhibited the highest percentage of stable gusA expression. Overall, this study established an efficient, optimized A. tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of D. tertiolecta, which represents a relatively easy procedure with no expensive equipment required. This simple and efficient protocol opens the possibility for further genetic manipulation of this commercially-important microalgae for biotechnological applications. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Chytrids are zoosporic fungi that play an important, but yet understudied, ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Many chytrid species have been morphologically described as parasites on phytoplankton. However, the majority of them have rarely been isolated and lack DNA sequence data. In this study we isolated and cultivated three parasitic chytrids, infecting a common volvocacean host species, Yamagishiella unicocca. To identify the chytrids, we characterized morphology and life cycle, and analyzed phylogenetic relationships based on 18S and 28S rDNA genes. Host range and specificity of the chytrids was determined by cross-infection assays with host strains, characterized by rbcL and ITS markers. We were able to confirm the identity of two chytrid strains as Endocoenobium eudorinae Ingold and Dangeardia mamillata Schr?der and described the third chytrid strain as Algomyces stechlinensis gen. et sp. nov. The three chytrids were assigned to novel and phylogenetically distant clades within the phylum Chytridiomycota, each exhibiting different host specificities. By integrating morphological and molecular data of both the parasitic chytrids and their respective host species, we unveiled cryptic host-parasite associations. This study highlights that a high prevalence of (pseudo)cryptic diversity requires molecular characterization of both phytoplankton host and parasitic chytrid to accurately identify and compare host range and specificity, and to study phytoplankton-chytrid interactions in general. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The traditional green algal genus Chloromonas accommodates mesophilic, cold-tolerant and cold-adapted microorganisms. In this paper, we studied a new strain isolated from a wet hummock meadow in the High Arctic. We used morphological, ultrastructural and molecular data to assess the taxonomic position and phylogenetic relationships of the new isolate. The observed morphological features generally corresponded to the cold-tolerant Chloromonas characteristics. However, ellipsoidal or wide ellipsoidal vegetative cells, a massive parietal cup-shaped chloroplast with a number of continuously connected lobes, a thick cell wall, a prominent hemispherical papilla and the anterior position of an oblong or round eyespot distinguished the alga from all previously described Chloromonas species. Analyses of rbcL and 18S rRNA genes showed that the new strain formed an independent lineage within a clade containing mesophilic and psychrotolerant Chloromonas species. Comparisons of secondary structure models of a highly variable ITS2 rDNA marker supported a separate species identity of the new isolate. Considering the morphological and molecular differences from its relatives, a new psychrotolerant species, Chloromonas svalbardensis, is proposed. Further, our results demonstrated the paraphyletic origin of Chloromonas within Chloromonadinia with genetically, morphologically and ecologically well-defined clades. We discuss a scenario of a possible Chloromonas split and revision. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Astaxanthin (ASX) is a xanthophyll family of hydroxycarotenoids which contains several double bonds. It is produced by Haemococcus pluvialis, a microalgae and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to test whether ASX could protect against oxidative damage in the testicular tissues of rats receiving high fructose. The rats (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa024) were randomly divided into two main groups: control and fructose (30%, via drinking water) and then each main group either not supplemented or supplemented with ASX (1\xc2\xa0mg kg-1 day-1 , within 0.2\xc2\xa0ml olive oil) via oral gavage. Data were subjected to two-way ANOVA. High fructose consumption tended to increase testis weight and serum testosterone concentration and decreased testicular tissue glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, but did not affect testicular tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Astaxanthin administration increased testosterone, GST and SOD levels and testis weight and decreased MDA concentration. However, ASX administration did not reverse alterations in antioxidant parameters caused by high fructose consumption. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) tended to increase in sertoli cell, spermatid and spermatogonia, but not in spermatocytes and leydig cell in response to high fructose consumption. Astaxanthin administration tended to reverse elevation in iNOS in testis cells. In conclusion, ASX could help alleviate oxidative damage caused by high fructose consumption. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The unicellular marine alga Dunaliella salina is a most interesting green cell factory for the production of carotenes and lipids under extreme environment conditions. However, the culture conditions and their productivity are the major challenges faced by researchers which still need to be addressed. In this study, we investigated the effect of bicarbonate amendment on biomass, photosynthetic activity, biochemical constituents, nutrient uptake and antioxidant response of D. salina during macronutrient deficit conditions (N-, P- and S-). Under nutrient deficit conditions, addition of sodium bicarbonate (100\xe2\x80\x89mM) significantly increased the biomass, carotenoids including \xc3\xa2-carotene and lutein, lipid, and fatty acid content with concurrent enhancement of the activities of nutrient assimilatory and carbonic anhydrase enzymes. Maximum accumulation of carotenoid especially \xc3\xa2-carotene (192.8\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x892.11\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb5g/100\xe2\x80\x89mg) and lipids (53.9%) was observed on addition of bicarbonate during nitrate deficiency compared to phosphate and sulphate deficiency. Supplementation of bicarbonate reduced the oxidative stress caused by ROS, lowered lipid peroxidation damage and improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and APX) in D. salina cultures under nutrient stress. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Phylogenomic analyses across the green algae are resolving relationships at the class, order, and family levels and highlighting dynamic patterns of evolution in organellar genomes. Here we present a within-family phylogenomic study to resolve genera and species relationships in the family Hydrodictyaceae (Chlorophyceae), for which poor resolution in previous phylogenetic studies, along with divergent morphological traits, have precluded taxonomic revisions.METHODS: Complete plastome sequences and mitochondrial protein-coding gene sequences were acquired from representatives of the Hydrodictyaceae using next-generation sequencing methods. Plastomes were characterized, and gene order and content were compared with plastomes spanning the Sphaeropleales. Single-gene and concatenated-gene phylogenetic analyses of plastid and mitochondrial genes were performed.KEY RESULTS: The Hydrodictyaceae contain the largest sphaeroplealean plastomes thus far fully sequenced. Conservation of plastome gene order within Hydrodictyaceae is striking compared with more dynamic patterns revealed across Sphaeropleales. Phylogenetic analyses resolve Hydrodictyon sister to a monophyletic Pediastrum, though the morphologically distinct P. angulosum and P. duplex continue to be polyphyletic. Analyses of plastid data supported the neochloridacean genus Chlorotetra?dron as sister to Hydrodictyaceae, while conflicting signal was found in the mitochondrial data.CONCLUSIONS: A phylogenomic approach resolved within-family relationships not obtainable with previous phylogenetic analyses. Denser taxon sampling across Sphaeropleales is necessary to capture patterns in plastome evolution, and further taxa and studies are needed to fully resolve the sister lineage to Hydrodictyaceae and polyphyly of Pediastrum angulosum and P. duplex. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Dunaliella, a commercially important chlorophyte, is globally distributed in saline habitats. Morphological species have not been definitively reconciled with phylogenetic analyses. Considerable genetic diversity continues to be discovered in new isolates, especially from soil and benthic habitats. Twenty-nine new isolates from Great Salt Lake, Utah, many from benthic or supralittoral habitats, were phylogenetically analyzed using ITS1+5.8S+ITS2 in comparison to a broad sampling of available sequences. A few new isolates align in one branch of a bifurcated monophyletic Dunaliella\xc2\xa0salina clade and several cluster within monophyletic D.\xc2\xa0viridis. Several others align with relatively few unnamed strains from other locations, comprising a diverse clade that may represent two or more new species. The overall Dunaliella clade is relatively robust, but the nearest outgroups are ambiguously placed with extremely long branches. About half of the isolates, all from benthic or supralittoral habitats, have been persistently sarcinoid in liquid media since isolation. This trait is spread across the Dunaliella phylogeny. The morphology of two sarcinoid strains was documented with light microscopy, revealing an extensive glycocalyx. Clumping behavior of unicellular and sarcinoid strains was unaffected by presence or absence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ , addition of lectin-inhibiting monosaccharides, or water-soluble factors from morphologically opposite strains. Results from this investigation have significantly expanded our current understanding of Dunaliella diversity, but it seems likely that much remains to be discovered with additional sampling. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Cell size correlates with most traits among phytoplankton species. Theory predicts that larger cells should show poorer photosynthetic performance, perhaps due to reduced intracellular self-shading (i.e. package effect). Yet current theory relies heavily on interspecific correlational approaches and causal relationships between size and photosynthetic machinery have remained untested. As a more direct test, we applied 250 generations of artificial selection (c. 20\xc2\xa0months) to evolve the green microalga Dunaliella teriolecta (Chlorophyta) toward different mean cell sizes, while monitoring all major photosynthetic parameters. Evolving larger sizes (>\xc2\xa01500% difference in volume) resulted in reduced oxygen production per chlorophyll molecule - as predicted by the package effect. However, large-evolved cells showed substantially higher rates of oxygen production - a finding unanticipated by current theory. In addition, volume-specific photosynthetic pigments increased with size (Chla+b), while photo-protectant pigments decreased (\xc3\xa2-carotene). Finally, larger cells displayed higher growth performances and Fv /Fm , steeper slopes of rapid light curves (\xc3\xa1) and smaller light-harvesting antennae (\xc3\xb3PSII ) with higher connectivity (\xc3\xb1). Overall, evolving a common ancestor into different sizes showed that the photosynthetic characteristics of a species coevolves with cell volume. Moreover, our experiment revealed a trade-off between chlorophyll-specific (decreasing with size) and volume-specific (increasing with size) oxygen production in a cell. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The unicellular green alga Haematococcus pluvialis accumulates large amounts of the red ketocarotenoid astaxanthin to protect against environmental stresses. Haematococcus cells that accumulate astaxanthin in the central part (green-red cyst cells) respond rapidly to intense light by distributing astaxanthin diffusively to the peripheral part of the cell within 10\xe2\x80\x89min after irradiation. This response is reversible: when astaxanthin-diffused cells were placed in the dark, astaxanthin was redistributed to the center of the cell. Although Haematococcus possesses several pigments other that astaxanthin, the subcellular distribution and content of each pigment remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the subcellular dynamics and localization of major pigments such as astaxanthin, \xc3\xa2-carotene, lutein, and chlorophylls under light irradiation using time-lapse and label-free hyperspectral imaging analysis. Fluorescence microscopy and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy showed that, preceding/following exposure to light, astaxanthin colocalized with lipid droplets, which moved from the center to the periphery through pathways in a chloroplast. This study revealed that photoresponse dynamics differed between astaxanthin and other pigments (chlorophylls, lutein, and \xc3\xa2-carotene), and that only astaxanthin freely migrates from the center to the periphery of the cell through a large, spherical, cytoplasm-encapsulating chloroplast as a lipid droplet. We consider this to be the Haematococcus light-protection mechanism. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The biodiversity of terrestrial algae is still grossly understudied, and African deserts in particular are barely touched in this respect. Here, four coccoid green algae from oases in the Western Desert of Egypt were characterized using a combination of morphotaxonomic, ecological and 18S rDNA data, with additional carotenoid and lipid analyses for two of the strains. Three strains were identified as affiliated with known taxa: Mychonastes sp., Asterarcys sp. (first report of this genus from a desert soil), and Stichococcus cf. deasonii. The fourth strain is proposed to represent a new cryptic genus Pharao gen. nov., with the type species P.\xc2\xa0desertorum sp. nov. The new taxon is sister to the clade of uncharacterized North American desert strains of Radiococcaceae (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta). The pigment profile of P.\xc2\xa0desertorum gen. et sp. nov. revealed carotenoids and chlorophylls typical of green algae. Bioorganic analysis showed a complex lipidome based on phospho- (PC), galacto- (MGDG and DGDG), betaine- (DGTS), and sulfoquinovosyl- (SQDG) membrane lipids, besides significant amounts of storage neutral lipids such as diacyl- (DAG) and triacylglycerols (TAG). The presence of saturated alkyl chains within all the membrane lipid classes in P.\xc2\xa0desertorum and Asterarcys sp. appears to reflect the need to maintain membrane fluidity and viscosity. In summary, African deserts likely still harbor new taxa to be described, and lipidomic analyses of such taxa may provide clues about their ability to survive in the extremely harsh desert habitats. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The Arctic is being disproportionally affected by climate change compared with other geographic locations, and is currently experiencing unprecedented melt rates. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) can be regarded as the largest supraglacial ecosystem on Earth, and ice algae are the dominant primary producers on bare ice surfaces throughout the course of a melt season. Ice-algal-derived pigments cause a darkening of the ice surface, which in turn decreases albedo and increases melt rates. The important role of ice algae in changing melt rates has only recently been recognized, and we currently know little about their community compositions and functions. Here, we present the first analysis of ice algal communities across a 100\xe2\x80\x89km transect on the GrIS by high-throughput sequencing and subsequent oligotyping of the most abundant taxa. Our data reveal an extremely low algal diversity with Ancylonema nordenski?ldii and a Mesotaenium species being by far the dominant taxa at all sites. We employed an oligotyping approach and revealed a hidden diversity not detectable by conventional clustering of operational taxonomic units and taxonomic classification. Oligotypes of the dominant taxa exhibit a site-specific distribution, which may be linked to differences in temperatures and subsequently the extent of the melting. Our results help to better understand the distribution patterns of ice algal communities that play a crucial role in the GrIS ecosystem. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are amalgamations of autotrophic, heterotrophic and saprotrophic organisms. In the Polar Regions, these unique communities occupy essential ecological functions such as primary production, nitrogen fixation and ecosystem engineering. Here, we present the first molecular survey of BSCs from the Arctic and Antarctica focused on both eukaryotes and prokaryotes as well as passive and active biodiversity. Considering sequence abundance, Bryophyta is among the most abundant taxa in all analyzed BSCs suggesting that they were in a late successional stage. In terms of algal and cyanobacterial biodiversity, the genera Chloromonas, Coccomyxa, Elliptochloris and Nostoc were identified in all samples regardless of origin confirming their ubiquitous distribution. For the first time, we found the chrysophyte Spumella to be common in polar BSCs as it was present in all analyzed samples. Co-occurrence analysis revealed the presence of sulfur metabolizing microbes indicating that BSCs also play an important role for the sulfur cycle. In general, phototrophs were most abundant within the BSCs but there was also a diverse community of heterotrophs and saprotrophs. Our results show that BSCs are unique microecosystems in polar environments with an unexpectedly high biodiversity. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The performance of a self-flocculating microalga Chlorococcum sp. GD on the flocculation, growth, and lipid accumulation in wastewater with different ammonia nitrogen concentrations was investigated. It was revealed that relative high ammonia nitrogen concentration (20-50 mg\xc2\xb7L-1) was beneficial to the flocculation of Chlorococcum sp. GD, and the highest flocculating efficiency was up to 84.4%. It was also found that the highest flocculating efficiency occurred in the middle of the culture (4-5 days) regardless of initial ammonia concentration in wastewater. It was speculated that high flocculating efficiency was likely related to the production of extracellular proteins. 20 mg\xc2\xb7L-1 of ammonia was found to be a preferred concentration for both biomass production and lipid accumulation. 92.8% COD, 98.8% ammonia, and 69.4% phosphorus were removed when Chlorococcum sp. GD was cultivated in wastewater with 20 mg\xc2\xb7L-1 ammonia. The novelty and significance of the investigation was the integration of flocculation, biomass production, wastewater treatment, and lipid accumulation, simultaneously, which made Chlorococcum sp. GD a potential candidate for wastewater treatment and biodiesel production if harvested in wastewater with suitable ammonia nitrogen concentration. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'TiO\xe2\x82\x82 nanoparticles (NPs), which are mainly used in consumer products (mostly cosmetics), have been found to cause ecotoxic effects in the aquatic environment. The green algae Raphidocelis subcapitata, as a representative of primary producers of the freshwater ecosystem, has been frequently used to study the effects of metal oxide NPs. An ecotoxicity study was conducted herein to investigate the effects of TiO\xe2\x82\x82 NPs on survival and membrane deformation of algal cells. Five different concentrations of nano-TiO\xe2\x82\x82 particles (1, 10, 50, 100 and 500 mg/L) were prepared in synthetic surface water samples with five different water quality characteristics (pH 6.4-8.4, hardness 10-320 mg CaCO\xe2\x82\x83/L, ionic strength 0.2-8 mM, and alkalinity 10-245 mg CaCO\xe2\x82\x83/L). Results showed a significant increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs with respect to both NP concentrations and ionic content of the test system. A soft synthetic freshwater system at pH 7.3 \xc2\xb1 0.2 appeared to provide the most effective water type, with more than 95% algal mortality observed at 50, 100 and 500 mg/L NP concentrations. At high exposure concentrations, increased malondialdehyde formations were observed. Moreover, due to membrane deformation, TEM images correlated the uptake of the NPs. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Microscopic green algae inhabiting desert microbiotic crusts are remarkably diverse phylogenetically, and many desert lineages have independently evolved from aquatic ancestors. Here we worked with five desert and aquatic species within the family Scenedesmaceae to examine mechanisms that underlie desiccation tolerance and release of unicellular versus multicellular progeny. Live cell staining and time-lapse confocal imaging coupled with transmission electron microscopy established that the desert and aquatic species all divide by multiple (rather than binary) fission, although progeny were unicellular in three species and multicellular (joined in a sheet-like coenobium) in two. During division, Golgi complexes were localized near nuclei, and all species exhibited dynamic rotation of the daughter cell mass within the mother cell wall at cytokinesis. Differential desiccation tolerance across the five species, assessed from photosynthetic efficiency during desiccation/rehydration cycles, was accompanied by differential accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected using a dye sensitive to intracellular ROS. Further comparative investigation will aim to understand the genetic, ultrastructural and physiological characteristics supporting unicellular versus multicellular coenobial morphology, and the ability of representatives in the Scenedesmaceae to colonize ecologically diverse, even extreme, habitats. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Culture experiments were conducted on ten phytoplankton species to examine their biological and physiological responses during exposure to oil and a combination of oil and dispersant. The species tested included a range of taxa typically found in the Gulf of Mexico such as cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and diatoms. Cultures were exposed to Macondo surrogate oil using the water accommodated fraction (WAF), and dispersed oil using a chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) and diluted CEWAF, to replicate conditions following the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A range of responses were observed, that could broadly class the algae as either "robust" or "sensitive" to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Robust algae were identified as Synechococcus elongatus, Dunaliella tertiolecta, two pennate diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula sp., and Skeletonema grethae CCMP775, and were largely unaffected by any of the treatments (no changes to growth rate or time spent in lag phase relative to controls). The rest of the phytoplankton, all centric diatoms, exhibited at least some combination of reduced growth rates or increased lag time in response to oil and/or dispersant exposure. Photophysiology did not have a strong treatment effect, with significant inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency (Fv /Fm ) only observed in the CEWAF, if at all. We found that the effects of oil and dispersants on phytoplankton physiology were species-dependent, and not always detrimental. This has significant implications on how oil spills might impact phytoplankton community structure and bloom dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico, which in turn impacts higher trophic levels. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Anthropogenic inputs of chemical environmental contaminants are frequently associated with developing harmful algal blooms, but little is known about how estuarine phytoplankton assemblages respond to multiple, co-occurring chemical stressors in chronically disturbed habitats. The goals of this research were to establish a robust protocol for testing the effects of atrazine on estuarine phytoplankton, and then to use that protocol to compare the effects of atrazine exposure with and without nutrient enrichment on a cosmopolitan estuarine/marine alga, Dunaliella tertiolecta (Chlorophyta). Atrazine sensitivity in nutrient-replete media (96-h growth inhibition [Formula: see text]) was 159.16\xc2\xa0\xc3\xacg\xc2\xa0l-1, but sensitivity was influenced by exposure duration, and inhibitory effects of herbicide on algal growth decreased under imbalanced nutrient regimes and low nitrogen and phosphorus supplies. These findings advance knowledge about how nutrient regimes and herbicides interact to control estuarine phytoplankton population dynamics. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Snow algae can form large-scale blooms across the snowpack surface and near-surface environments. These pigmented blooms can decrease snow albedo and increase local melt rates, and they may impact the global heat budget and water cycle. Yet, the underlying causes for the geospatial occurrence of these blooms remain unconstrained. One possible factor contributing to snow algal blooms is the presence of mineral dust as a micronutrient source. We investigated the bioavailability of iron (Fe)-bearing minerals, including forsterite (Fo90, Mg1.8Fe0.2SiO4), goethite, smectite, and pyrite as Fe sources for a Chloromonas brevispina-bacterial coculture through laboratory-based experimentation. Fo90 was capable of stimulating snow algal growth and increased the algal growth rate in otherwise Fe-depleted cocultures. Fo90-bearing systems also exhibited a decrease in the ratio of bacteria to algae compared to those of Fe-depleted conditions, suggesting a shift in microbial community structure. The C. brevispina coculture also increased the rate of Fo90 dissolution relative to that of an abiotic control. Analysis of 16S rRNA genes in the coculture identified Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteria, all of which are commonly found in snow and ice environments. Archaea were not detected. Collimonas and Pseudomonas, which are known to enhance mineral weathering rates, comprised two of the top eight (>1%) operational taxonomic units (OTUs). These data provide unequivocal evidence that mineral dust can support elevated snow algal growth under otherwise Fe-depleted growth conditions and that snow algal microbial communities can enhance mineral dissolution under these conditions.IMPORTANCE Fe, a key micronutrient for photosynthetic growth, is necessary to support the formation of high-density snow algal blooms. The laboratory experiments described herein allow for a systematic investigation of the interactions of snow algae, bacteria, and minerals and their ability to mobilize and uptake mineral-bound Fe. Results provide unequivocal and comprehensive evidence that mineral-bound Fe in Fe-bearing Fo90 was bioavailable to Chloromonas brevispina snow algae within an algal-bacterial coculture. This evidence includes (i) an observed increase in snow algal density and growth rate, (ii) decreased ratios of bacteria to algae in Fo90-containing cultures relative to those of cultures grown under similarly Fe-depleted conditions with no mineral-bound Fe present, and (iii) increased Fo90 dissolution rates in the presence of algal-bacterial cocultures relative to those of abiotic mineral controls. These results have important implications for the role of mineral dust in supplying micronutrients to the snow microbiome, which may help support dense snow algal blooms capable of lowering snow albedo and increasing snow melt rates on regional, and possibly global, scales. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b"Much of our current knowledge of microbial growth is obtained from studies at a population level. Driven by the realization that processes that operate within a population might influence a population's behavior, we sought to better understand Tetradesmus obliquus (formerly Scenedesmus obliquus) physiology at the cellular level. In this work, an accurate pretreatment method to quantitatively obtain single cells of T.\xc2\xa0obliquus, a coenobia-forming alga, is described. These single cells were examined by flow cytometry for triacylglycerol (TAG), chlorophyll, and protein content, and their cell sizes were recorded by coulter counter. We quantified heterogeneity of size and TAG content at single-cell level for a population of T.\xc2\xa0obliquus during a controlled standard batch cultivation. Unexpectedly, variability of TAG content per cell within the population increased throughout the batch run, up to 400 times in the final stage of the batch run, with values ranging from 0.25 to 99\xc2\xa0pg\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb7\xc2\xa0cell-1 . Two subpopulations, classified as having low or high TAG content per cell, were identified. Cell size also increased during batch growth with average values from 36 to 70\xc2\xa0\xc3\xacm3 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xb7\xc2\xa0cell-1 ; yet cell size variability increased only up to 16 times. Cell size and cellular TAG content were not correlated at the single-cell level. Our data show clearly that TAG production is affected by cell-to-cell variation, which suggests that its control and better understanding of the underlying processes may improve the productivity of T.\xc2\xa0obliquus for industrial processes such as biodiesel production. labels: #Chlorophyceae"
b'Oxylipins (OXLs) are bioactive molecules generated by the oxidation of fatty acids that promote the resolution of acute inflammation and prevent chronic inflammatory processes through molecular mechanisms that are not well known. We have previously reported the anti-inflammatory activity of microalgae-derived OXLs and OXL-containing biomass in two inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced acute colitis and TNBS-induced recurrent colitis. In this study, we examined the in vitro anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of the most abundant OXLs isolated from Chlamydomonas debaryana (13S-HOTE and 13S-HODE) and Nannochloropsis gaditana (15S-HEPE). These OXLs decreased IL-1\xc3\xa2 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines production as well as iNOS and COX-2 expression levels in THP-1 macrophages. In addition, OXLs decreased IL-8 production in HT-29 colon cells, the major chemokine produced by these cells. The interaction of OXLs with NF\xc3\xaaB and PPAR-\xc3\xa3 signaling pathways was studied by confocal microscopy. In THP-1 macrophages and HT-29 colon cells, stimulated by LPS and TNF\xc3\xa1 respectively, a pre-treatment with 13S-HOTE, 13S-HODE and 15S-HEPE (100\xc3\xacM) resulted in a lower nuclear presence of NF\xc3\xaaB in both cell lines. The study of the subcellular localization of PPAR-\xc3\xa3 showed that the treatment of THP-1 and HT-29 cells with these OXLs caused the migration of PPAR-\xc3\xa3 into the nucleus. Colocalization analysis of both transcription factors in LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages showed that the pre-treatment with 13S-HOTE, 13S-HODE or 15S-HEPE lowered nuclear colocalization similar to control value, and increased cytosolic localization above control level. These results indicate that these OXLs could act as agonist of PPAR-\xc3\xa3 and consequently inhibit NF\xc3\xaaB signaling pathway activation, thus lowering the production of inflammatory markers, highlighting the therapeutic potential of these OXLs in inflammatory diseases such as IBD. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) has attracted increasing interest, yet throughput remains one major factor limiting its broader application. Here we present an integrated Raman-activated droplet sorting (RADS) microfluidic system for functional screening of live cells in a label-free and high-throughput manner, by employing AXT-synthetic industrial microalga Haematococcus pluvialis (H. pluvialis) as a model. Raman microspectroscopy analysis of individual cells is carried out prior to their microdroplet encapsulation, which is then directly coupled to DEP-based droplet sorting. To validate the system, H. pluvialis cells containing different levels of AXT were mixed and underwent RADS. Those AXT-hyperproducing cells were sorted with an accuracy of 98.3%, an enrichment ratio of eight folds, and a throughput of ?260 cells/min. Of the RADS-sorted cells, 92.7% remained alive and able to proliferate, which is equivalent to the unsorted cells. Thus, the RADS achieves a much higher throughput than existing RACS systems, preserves the vitality of cells, and facilitates seamless coupling with downstream manipulations such as single-cell sequencing and cultivation. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The biofuels are receiving considerable attention as a substitute for petro diesel. For microalgae, the cell density or biomass and lipid contents are key components for biodiesel production. This study was conducted to develop favorable culture conditions for Dunaliella salina to maximize its biomass and lipid accumulation. The effect of salinity (0.5 to 2.5\xe2\x80\x89M NaCl) on the cell population, biochemical composition, and lipid output of Dunaliella salina was examined under a controlled environment for 21 days. Maximum growth (6.57\xe2\x80\x89?\xe2\x80\x89107 to 7.17\xe2\x80\x89?\xe2\x80\x89107cells mL-1) potentials were observed at 1.5 to 2\xe2\x80\x89M NaCl. The photosynthetic pigments and carbohydrates also showed trends similar to growth. The maximum carotenoid level (5.16\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89L-1) was recorded at 2\xe2\x80\x89M NaCl. Almost all physicochemical parameters increased with increases in salinity, biomass (1231.66\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x891.26\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89L-1) and lipid content (248.33\xe2\x80\x89mg\xe2\x80\x89L-1), as recorded at 2\xe2\x80\x89M NaCl. Based on fluorescence intensity, the highest values (11.84\xe2\x80\x89?\xe2\x80\x89107cells/ml) of neutral lipids and total lipids (22.28%) were recorded at optimum salinity levels. The present study suggests that a high biomass and lipid accumulation of Dunaliella salina SA 134 could be obtained at the 2\xe2\x80\x89M NaCl level. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'A bioassay battery-integrated index was applied to different soils sampled from a former coke factory, with the aim to evaluate the discriminating capacity of the Ecoscore system (ES) to assess the environmental hazard of PAH-polluted soils. Two soils from a former coke factory, polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were evaluated for their ecotoxicity to terrestrial and aquatic organisms and their genotoxicity. These soils have been already presented in a previous paper but data have been reanalyzed for the present article in an endeavor to standardize the ES. One soil was sampled in the untreated site and the second underwent a windrow treatment. While these soils had a similar total concentrations of US-EPA 16PAHs (around 3000\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0kg-1), different ecoscores were obtained when subjected to a set of solid- and liquid-phase bioassays measuring acute, chronic, and genotoxic effects. The total PAH content of the soil is not a pertinent parameter to assess soil pollution hazards contrary to the ES. ES is a robust method to classify soils according to their toxicity level. Four levels of toxicity have been defined: no (ecoscore\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00), weak (0\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0ecoscore ?33), moderate (33\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0ecoscore ?67), and strong toxicity (67\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa0ecoscore\xc2\xa0?\xc2\xa0100). The combination of chemical and toxicological data highlights the relationship between three-ring PAHs and acute ecotoxicity. Conversely, chronic effects of water extracts on algal growth could be explained by high molecular weight PAHs, such as five- and six-ring PAHs. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
b'The system of the green microalgal order Protosiphonales (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta) constructed\nbased on morphological, ecological, and molecular genetic data is considered. Subdivision of the\norder (=macroclade Stephanosphaerinia) into four groups is proposed, with three probably corresponding to\nthe families Stephanosphaeraceae, Chlorococcaceae, and Protosiphonaceae and the fourth having an indefinite\nstatus. The diagnostic characteristics of the families, genera, and species are discussed, as well as the independent\nrank of some taxa. Morphological descriptions of a number of species are supplemented. Based on\npolyphasic approach, strain ACSSI 23 is proposed as a candidate for a new genus and species. labels: #Chlorophyceae'
